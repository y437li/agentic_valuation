Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. Kent Schofield, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Kent Schofield : Thank you, Christine, and thank you for joining us today. Welcome to Uber Technologies Q1 2019 earnings presentation. On the call today, we have Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO; Nelson Chai, CFO; and this is Kent Schofield, Head of Investor Relations. Dara Khosrowshahi : Kent, thank you. Welcome everyone to our first earnings conference call as a public company. We are very excited. Our IPO earlier this month was an important moment for Uber. It was a combination of nearly a decade of work to build the network, product, technology and operational excellence that power our global platform today. It\u2019s also the result of more recent changes, including our adoption of a world-class governance standards and update to our cultural values, and a shift towards long-term partnership with cities, regulators, and the millions of people and organizations who use our technology to earn income owing to grow their business every day. While I am proud of what we have achieved at -- with our IPO, I have told our team that it is ultimately just one moment in a much longer journey. We have an even greater duty to create long-term value for investors, our customers, our employees and our many stakeholders. We will do this by making Uber the platform -- by making the Uber platform a one-stop shop for the movement of people and powering local commerce around the world at a massive scale over 700 cities and 63 countries. Nelson Chai : Thanks, Dara. Now on to Q1 2019, which as a reminder came in at or near the high end of the financial ranges we provided last month in our perspective. Our GAAP revenue of $3.1 billion was up 20% year-over-year. Our GAAP cost of revenues excluding D&A of $1.7 billion increased to 54% from 45% of revenue in Q1 of 2018. Our GAAP EPS was a loss of $2.26 per share, compared to a gain of $1.84 in Q1 of 2018, which benefited from a $3.2 billion gain attributable to the Grab and Yandex transactions that closed during that quarter. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Thank you, Nelson. Sometimes simplicity is a beautiful thing. Now while the canvas that we operate against and seen complex our story is simple. We are the global player. We are the largest player in personal mobility. Our brand, our technology, our operational platform all give a structural advantages versus the monoline players. We have a generational and demographic wave behind us and our job is to grow fast, at scale and more efficiently for a long, long time. And while the markets that we compete in are and will remain competitive, we like what we see. Our IPO was an important step in our evolution but just a step. Our teams are focused, motivated, talented and very, very determined to prove Uber\u2019s value to our shareholders. With that, we are ready for some Q&A. Kent Schofield : Thanks, Dara. Operator, you can open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you.  Your first question comes from line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, just the first one on Rideshare MAPCs, can you sort of talk to us big picture about what you think the biggest hurdle you have to overcome to continue to drive fast Rideshare MAPCs growth in some of your oldest markets in the U.S., whether it\u2019s price density and how do you do that, what are your strategies in place to kind of continue to grow MAPCs? Then the second one, on Uber Rewards, any color on early learning there, comments on frequency of users that are using that product and how do you think about pushing that more globally over time? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. And just before as a core Rideshare markets, I think, as it relates to audience or MAPCs. First of all, there is a natural expansion that is happening. You look at, one, is there\u2019s an expansion from the city cores to the city suburbs. That is naturally happening. For example, in New York City now, over 50% of our rides don\u2019t originate or end in Manhattan and that was very much not true three years, four years ago. So you see there\u2019s kind of a natural expansion from the core into the suburbs. The second for us is that you have got kind of the newer millennial generation that is not particularly interested in owning a car. I think the stats are something like 26% of 16-year-olds got their licenses and that compares to double what it was just 20 years, 30 years ago. So we do have this urbanization happening on a global basis. We have got this generational wave that is just not interested in car ownership and in all of that absolutely helps us. Then I think that you look at our other businesses that we are growing in including Eats and our Scooter business, the New Mobility business, 50% of our Eats customers actually don\u2019t use rides. So whereas the Ride business is a very strong audience creator for the Eats business, now as Eats extends especially into some out -- into some of these suburbs, Eats is finding new customers for us which first of all are going to be customers for Eats. But these are customers that then we can up-sell into the Ride business as well. And then the Scooter business for us like e-bikes and e-scooters are finding yet another generation of usually younger customers who are in the center of cities and what we are finding is that with our New Mobility products we are actually -- of the customers who use our NeMo products, they are typically under penetrated in terms of using a rides product. So it\u2019s a whole new customer base. Sometimes they have use a rides product and we work to activate, reactivating them. Sometimes they weren\u2019t using rides at all. So it\u2019s reaching into yet another customer segment and it\u2019s also reaching into a different type of trip, a trip that\u2019s typically less than 5 miles. And then you see it\u2019s also penetrating into transit and other areas with our marketplace strategy, which is really getting into every single use case that you would want as far as transportation and usually cheaper use cases. So this is POOL. This is a Express POOL and then these are transit partnerships that we have. They are for folks who want to spend $4 or $5 or even $1 or $2 per ride. So that\u2019s all within a country. And then also keep in mind that we have six target countries, Germany, Argentina, Japan, South Korea, Spain and Italy. These are countries that we believe that we can open up. We think that Uber can grow service in those countries and we think that there\u2019s a regulatory opening in those countries, so to speak. It will take some time. Those countries will represent a 20% increase in population of MAPCs potential and there are many, many other countries that either we are not in or we had to get out of, Finland, Norway, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, et cetera. So all of these kind of increases the overall population, etcetera. So I think on the MAPCs side, there are -- there isn\u2019t one silver bullet, but there are many, many levers and we have teams working at each of these levers to continue to increase MAPCs, not just for the ride business, but the overall Uber platform as well. And the second question was about rewards is that right? Brian Nowak : Yeah. Yeah. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. Was it about the rewards of things? Brian Nowak : Yeah. Yeah. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think in terms of rewards, on the consumer side, we are going pretty aggressively in the U.S. and we are seeing very good early signal and we are seeing very high consumer satisfaction. The other great thing about rewards is that it knits our various services together. You have also seen that we have a subscription product on the ride side and you can anticipate our being more aggressive in tying in our different products across our subscription products as well. So, we are very happy with the early results from rewards, but it is early and we think that that\u2019s a product that we can optimize pretty significantly going forward. And we are certainly looking at launches outside of the U.S. although we haven\u2019t announced anything yet. Kent Schofield : Thanks Brian for the question. Operator, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks. Just a couple of things, you made the point in the press release of continuing to see signs of less aggressive pricing by some of your Ridesharing competitors. Just curious to the extent that you can elaborate on that, how universal that is in terms of geography. How much of that is in the U.S. versus some of the other more important markets to you? And then on the Eats side of the business, obviously, with headlines about competitors raising more money in this space, so curious about your view on how or what type of consolidation is going to happen within the Eats category and to what degree Uber potentially takes part in that in some way? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. I think on the competitive front there is no universal, everything single country is different and we would be here for half an hour if we describe the competitive position in every country. I think some important ones. In the U.S., if you listen to the Lyft conference call, for example, they talked about competing more on brand and I think that competing more on brand and product is, call it, a healthier mode of competition than just throwing money at a challenge. So we have seen that pencil out into the market, so to speak, and we are, obviously, operating independently. But I say we like what we see on the competitive front in the U.S., which is our largest market. In South America, in Brazil, Mexico, et cetera, we certainly saw competitive entry by DD and some other players and we are seeing it stabilize at this point. And so, again, will things get better or worse, we can\u2019t predict. But I think that sitting here today versus where we were three months ago, we are always uncomfortable in our chairs, but we are less uncomfortable, so to speak, and I think, we have more of a handle on the competitive situation and I think we feel net better. Now that can get worse or better, but I\u2019d say today, we feel better on the competitive front overall on a global basis. I think in -- as it relates to Eats and the landscape there in food delivery. Listen, there\u2019s a lot of capital coming in because it is a huge category and there are some folks that believe that the category -- the food category can be larger than the ride category, and if that\u2019s true, and by the way it could be true. In China, it looks like it is larger than the ride category that would be an enormous win for us. But today it does -- it is challenging and that there are many players that are well-funded, they are well operated and they are competing to win. But we are the biggest player outside our China. We love our team. We love our technology and the platform that we have and the ability of our ride business to, one, has built a brand that is very, very recognizable but also move riders from eaters is considerable and I will tell you that we are very, very early in the stages of exploring the many, many ways in which our Ride business can help continue to build our Eats business and vice versa by the way. So will there be consolidation? Yeah, I think, there will absolutely be consolidation. We are not in a hurry in that. I think that whether consolidation happened sooner or later, we will be kind of the biggest player on a global basis. We like our competitive chances. We love the advantage that we have as it relates to the platform. So we will play a consolidating part if it makes sense for shareholders from a long-term perspective. But it\u2019s kind of a plan B, because our plan A, which is an organic plan is a great plan and we feel very strongly about it. Heath Terry : Great. Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is open. Ross Sandler : Great. Two questions from me guys. So, on the Ride incentives issues, so you mentioned that they have come down a little bit. I guess the question is, as those come down on the rider side and as prices or fares increase, how sensitive are GV volumes and GV growth rates in rides to increasing prices and are you seeing anything new in the current quarter relative to the first quarter on ride\u2019s GV growth? And then the second question is on Eads. So I think there\u2019s a perception out there that Eats\u2019 take rate is coming down, because of your larger QSR deals but Nelson you mentioned India. So can you parse the Eats take rate compression between India and maybe other factors like building out selection and any update on the Eats business post the pricing changes in March? Thanks. Nelson Chai : Sure. So, Heath this is Nelson. In terms on the Ride side, we haven\u2019t really right, and so, the only the place that we are watching is New York. And as you know they are mandated pricing moves that have happened and we have been passing it on. So we have seen that increase. It\u2019s been less about a category position story for us but pricing has increased and I think it probably does have ultimately some impact in terms of how gross bookings grow in the category there, but our position is quite strong there. Beyond that we haven\u2019t seen that too much. Regarding your question about Eats. Yeah, India is an investment market for us, right? And so, there\u2019s two things going on there. It\u2019s going quite -- it\u2019s growing very, very quickly. There two competitors that are very aggressive on it including ourselves. We are doing well on holding our own but it is a net market in that we are funding both the eater, the courier, as well as the restaurant in terms of building the business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks if you think about a 400-basis-point difference in terms of our contribution or take rates, sorry, in year-over-year in Uber Eats it was half of it and the other half is really about increasing restaurant selection, increasing incentives for our restaurant partners and that\u2019s the difference between how we are going there. But in terms of how the business is going out it continues to grow well. As Dara mentioned it\u2019s more of a market by market situation. It\u2019s growing very, very quick fast as you saw from our results and we continue to do well. But I would say that, there are certain markets where there are well-funded competitors that are growing and you see in the U.S. where we had a competitor that\u2019s well funded and growing quite quickly and we are going fast as well, but they are growing their category position faster than us. Dara Khosrowshahi : We should also expect, Nelson, correct me if I am wrong, which is our take rate for Eats on the way up\u2026 Nelson Chai : Correct. Dara Khosrowshahi : \u2026for the balance of the year versus the other way, so we have -- this should be the low watermark and then you should see the take rate for Eats increase over the balance of the year. Nelson Chai : And then your last question was on the new service fees and so they just saw it. But they have been well received. We haven\u2019t seen any impact on the business. As Dara said, you will see the take rates improve through the balance of the year and you should see the ANR increase as well, as you think through the balance of the year in terms of the growth rates. Dara Khosrowshahi : And, Ross, just to your first question around on rationalization in a competitive environment, you alluded to this, but just to clear, it impacts take rate. It impacts sales and marketing as you think about driver and rider side, and all that. I just want to be clear on that side. Thank you for the question, Ross. Operator, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi. Your line is open. Mark May, your line is open. If you are on mute please unmute. Mark May : Okay. Can you hear me? Okay. You touched on this a minute ago, but I think New York City is the top five market I believe for you and there had been some very recent changes there. So just curious if you could comment on how, if at all, the recent changes in New York City including the new fees and the limits on growing supply. If that\u2019s impacted the market, the growth in the market at all recently and if so, how we should think about that. And then, secondly, more of a housekeeping question, regarding the guidance on sales and marketing leverage for Q2. Is that on a bookings or an ANR basis and would you expect that to persist in the second half? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. Sure. In terms of -- I will take the first question. Nelson will take the second question. In terms of New York City, listen, our business is pretty darn resilient. And the changes made in New York City, while we don\u2019t think that they are consumer-friendly and the caps, et cetera, we certainly don\u2019t think that they are driver partner friendly, our business has proven out to be pretty resilient. So it has translated into pretty substantial price increases to the consumer, to the rider. We have seen that effect trip volumes definitely because there is some price sensitivity as it relates to any product and ours is not accepted. But, overall, if you look at the dollar growth rate in New York, it\u2019s still a healthy city for us. We do think we are still proponents of comprehensive reform in terms of congestion pricing, kind of more market-based regulation. We do want to be constructive here and a city with too much traffic and lots of cars standing still doesn\u2019t serve us, doesn\u2019t serve our riders, doesn\u2019t serve our drivers as well. So our service has certainly shown its resilience. We think the environment can get better. But New York continues to grow for us and continues to grow at a healthy pace on a dollar volume standpoint. Nelson Chai : And then Mark this is Nelson. On your second part of the question, yes, we expect that our core platform ANR as a percent of gross bookings to improve sequentially. And then we do expect that as we think through the back half of \u201819, we are going to see those benefits continue, as well as an acceleration year-over-year of our adjusted net revenue. Mark May : Sorry. I was referring to sales and marketing leverage. Nelson Chai : Yes. So that leverage was against -- it will be against both, but really -- but the point was about our gross book. Dara Khosrowshahi : And Mark I will add a little bit to the prior question in that, as you think about sales and marketing, you think about promotions to the rider and you think about rationalization, generally, that has an impact there as well. Mark May : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thank you, Mark. Operator next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Great. Thanks. Two questions from my side. Just briefly on our synergies between Ridesharing and Eats? Can you talk a little bit more about the strategy to try to generate more of those synergies over time? And then, Nelson, could you talk about any new insights you have from beginning leverage against insurance costs, which seems to be material components of COGS, any new insights there? Thank you very much Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, Mark. I don\u2019t want to give away too much in terms of competitive strategy going forward. But suffice it to say that we are starting to experiment in ways in which we can up-sell our ride customers to Eats deal in a way that to be plainspoken isn\u2019t annoying in a way that is beneficial to our riders. And we are seeing some very, very encouraging early signal. Usually, if you -- if you have got a core product, and obviously, you can imagine that our app has a relatively limited space to promote other things to do other than get a ride. Usually they are plus or minus to your putting in a promotion to do something else. And what we found is that with Rides and Eats, we have got very talented tech and product team, and we are seeing early signal where essentially you can have very little if any cannibalization of a Ride and throw a significant amount of potential demand onto the Eats side. And these are very early experimentation results, and again, are very much could be won, but are showing a signal that creates a good amount of excitement for us in-house. There are also ways for us to tie the businesses together as it relates to loyalty program, which we are pretty early on in, as it relates to subscriptions, as it relates to promotions, et cetera on the backend, which again we are fairly early in the experimentation stage. So, I think, that -- I don\u2019t want to give away too much, but there\u2019s a whole host of activity that the teams are focused on. And really what we are looking to do is significantly increase the percentage of our MAPCs that use those products and when we see customers using more than one product, their engagement with the platform more than doubles. So not only does engagement with Uber increase, but the engagement with our individual products increases as well, so it\u2019s kind of a win, win, win. Nelson Chai : And then, Mark, on insurance there\u2019s not a step function improvement, I would say, it\u2019s more grinding now. And so what we have done over time is the team has built a great actuary book and so what that enables us to do is a couple of things. Now, first of all, you shouldn\u2019t see quarter to quarter noise in our accruals and that\u2019s actually pretty important. It allows us also to go in and work with a lot of the national carriers in our Transit business, so that is helpful. You heard in my prepared comments how we are leveraging technology and data to help in terms of instant response times. And so a great way to also help outcome is make sure you have really good fast in terms of response which we are doing. And then the one thing I would tell you is that over time, insurance, while there is a little bit of a service in the U.S. to offset, it\u2019s largely impacting the U.S. Rideshare business. So it will continue to become a smaller part of the overall P&L as other parts of the business continue to grow quickly. So that would be my takeaway and so I think you will see us continue to grind out productivity out of insurance. Mark Mahaney : Thanks, Nelson. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Kunal Madhukar : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is Kunal on for Lloyd. Two if I may. One, what are the nuances associated with the markets that are currently generating over 50% contribution margins? And if you are already in -- if you are already getting more than 50% contribution margins in one market, how do you see that kind of -- how do you see contribution margins in the future in other markets? And second, with regard to lower costs that will open up the TAM. How do you -- what are the key elements to getting pricing lower absent a shift to autonomous? Is all really growing in the right mix enough to lower the price meaningfully or are there other pathways to lowering the pricing? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Absolutely. On contribution margin? Nelson Chai : Yeah. So I will start on the contribution margins. So I think in the markets where we have high contribution margins. We are -- we have very strong category positions. We have good take rates. And so what I mean by that is the adjusted net revenue percent of gross billing that tends to be higher. And then in those markets, believe it or not, there are -- there is competition, but we have done a good job in terms of how the market has evolved and so we have very, very strong position from that standpoint. What you will see over time as we -- as the markets continue to evolve, you will see us continue, particularly in the rideshare side, focus more on contribution and you will see us get more efficient. And so we will get the scale benefits of just the -- our global scale versus everyone else is to deploy technology and operations. And you will see its continued to grind out some of the productivity metrics we are going to work on and things like insurance and things like payments and other things. And then, as Dara and I mentioned, the one wildcard is going to be market by market what happens from a competitive position. And so, while we feel comfortable sitting here today and looking into the next couple of quarters, those things can change, but as we see through those things that will happen. And then the last part of it, because again, this is a core contribution metric is, how Eats continues to evolve. In that -- what in the specific market where you mentioned that we have a very strong market position, we have a strong -- we have a good Eats business as well. And again, while we are not going to disclose where that place is, there are markets where we, again, we have good core contribution margins across the globe and you will see us continue to give you more highlights as we have the quarters continue here. Dara Khosrowshahi : And I guess the other way that I\u2019d put it is that, the markets with high contribution margins, we don\u2019t consider it to be outliers. The outliers were the U.S. where our company went through some very, very significant challenges as it related to brand and what has frankly been a strong competitor and lift. And so, the U.S. is an outlier as far as the scale business that hasn\u2019t yet achieved very strong contribution margins. There are markets like Latin America where we have got our competitor come in more recently, but from a structural standpoint, actually this is a business that we believe can be a very significant contribution margin positive and the one outlier is in the U.S., and in the U.S. we suffer some brand damage. That\u2019s very unusual. That\u2019s going to take some time to repair. And now, I think in the U.S. we are in a competitive position with the other player where competition is going to be more health. It\u2019s going to be based on brand and products and technology, which we think is the right place to compete versus throwing money of the problem. I think on the quarter is to low cost, et cetera. Listen, I think, that there are many different ways in which we take on low cost. First of all, as it relates to the POOL products. What we are really focused on is being more efficient and increasing the match rates as it relates to each trip, and it means being smarter about which trips we match. And then also the introduction of Express POOL that essentially adds waiting and then adds walking to the equation in order to increase the match rates as well. Historically, we have price POOL quite aggressively in order to create liquidity in the marketplace in order to create the opportunity to match. Now, actually I pay the majority of the work is and in improving our matching capabilities versus using pricing thing to increase liquidity. Beyond POOL and Express POOL, we are investing in high-capacity vehicles either we call it Uber Shuttle or Uber Buff  that we have launched in that number of markets. This is about taking matching to the next level,10 riders in a single vehicle, 15 riders in a single vehicle. We think we will do these ourselves, over a long-term and then they also partner up with governments, do kind of public private partnerships to be a part of the transportation solutions of the cities in which we operate. Beyond that are having public transport, we talked about the integration in Denver. We have integrated London public transit into our app as well. And while that\u2019s not strictly our product that we will be marketing, it\u2019s another essentially search or another occasion by which users will come to our app to learn what\u2019s the best way to get from point A to B. And as every user every day in every city is opening up our app in the morning when they want to get to some place then good things are going to happen over a period of time. So we don\u2019t think there\u2019s any kind of magic lever here, but we are putting more against these different modes of transportation. And then you add to that, e-bikes, scooters, bolster our own products and through partnership with LINE and we are looking at partnering with other players as well. You just have a whole transportation ecosystem on one app, all your information, fully integrated with the loyalty building. So we think that\u2019s a very, very powerful product, but it will take time for all of it to come together. Kent Schofield : Thank you, Kunal Madhukar. Operator, next question. Kunal Madhukar : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Kahn Masha from HSBC. Your line is open. Kahn Masha : Oh! Hi. I am interested in your payments strategy. You mentioned you are introducing payments wallet in emerging markets. Are these cash products you mentioned going to be used only for Uber ecosystem or can it be used for remittances and outside Uber platform? Can you please talk a little bit about that? Nelson Chai : Sure. So the start of our payments is really on productivity right now and so 87% of the transactions that happen on Uber are done with a swipe. And so what we are doing right now is really focus -- the team is really focused on trying to drive down some of the costs and we are going to -- you are going to see those benefits. And those are both in terms of core process improvement. We have improved some of our cash collections and arrears, fraud prevention. There\u2019s all sorts of different operating things as we continue to focus on productivity. And so that\u2019s going on right now and we are seeing the benefits now and you will continue to see the benefits throughout the year moving forward. The second thing we did launch and which I mentioned is a closed-loop wallet. And it\u2019s just really to help in certain markets like, Brazil, which is really a cash market for us, and it really helps in terms of a lot of cases because in the U.S., we really worry about riders. In Brazil, we have to really focus on drivers\u2019 safety and so because drivers -- there are incidents with drivers, they are getting robbed or they are getting carjacked. And so, the more and more you can move away from cash and it\u2019s beneficial, additionally, we do see that if you have Uber cash credit on your account, you will use our service additionally. The last thing is really just we are evaluating how open we own in terms of the wallet, which I think was your question. And I would say that\u2019s an opportunity we are looking at now. You did notice that PayPal invested as part of IPO and so we are talking to a number of different partners and we are going to those own just that own process internally now upon opening want to be. You can envision that with a company that is growing as Dara said now, the runway to the business is over -- is approaching $60 billion a year in terms of our billings this year. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity that we see ahead on it. So we are just working through that now. The real takeaway right now is just to focus on the productivity side, which we are getting and you will see in our results. Kent Schofield : Thank you, Kahn, for the question. Operator, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali from SunTrust. Your line is open. Youssef, if you are on mute, please unmute. Your line is open. Youssef Squali : Yeah. Sorry, apologies for that. Dara, you mentioned a couple of times now that competition is more going to be focused on brand and products. Maybe you can flesh that out a little bit. Brand competition could also be pretty expensive proposition. So, maybe if you can just help us understand what you mean exactly by that that will be helpful. And also, if maybe you can just give us an update on the -- those six markets where it\u2019s been more difficult to do business in particular in Germany. I think the last time you mentioned that, you had started making headway there. So any help there would be helpful? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. When I talk about brand and product, really, it\u2019s shorthand for talking about the quality of the service. What are your average GTAs? What are your ETAs kind of P90 ETAs? How do you make sure that every single customer interaction is a great interaction? What\u2019s the quality of the vehicle and your driver partners? Are they happy? Are they hospitable? How is your pricing? How consistent is your pricing? How are your match rates, et cetera. So really kind of when you think about our services. There\u2019s a cost to customer acquisition. How are you bringing customers into the funnel? We think we have an advantage because we essentially are acquiring customers across multiple verticals. Second is how long are your customers staying with you? How loyal are they? We think that with our loyalty programs, with subscriptions, with payments, with wallets, we have now all the tools again against a multitude of different products that we can offer on one consumer, so that we think that we have got kind of structural loyalty advantage over the other players. And then we are constantly iterating and improving our experience and our technology in order to make sure that it\u2019s best of breed in terms of your ETAs, your pricing, your routing, how quickly do you get from point A to B and all the different choices that we offer you as well. So we think that\u2019s a great area for us to compete in. And listen, the Uber brand is a brand that everybody knows all around the world and we have already built two multibillion dollar services on the Uber brand and we think Freight will be a third. So, we like competition as it relates to kind of brand product technology and we think that over the long term, our being the bigger player, our being the global player and our being the multi-product player is going to put us in a very good position where competition is not just about dollars. Now, if it is about dollars, we are going to push back as hard as anyone pushes us as well. Nelson Chai : I think the\u2026 Dara Khosrowshahi : Just talk about the six countries. Nelson Chai : Yeah. The six countries. I\u2019d highlight, listen, each of these countries is unique in its own way. Germany for us has been a country that has been a significant investment. I have been to Germany already three times. We are kind of growing in Germany the right way. It takes longer to build a service, to some extent based on the regulations there. But we are very happy with the growth rates in Germany, we are very happy with the quality of the service there. And we think that the regulations are headed in the right direction, so that we can build a larger service and in a way that ultimately is better for the cities. Germany has regulations, for example, of return to base where if a private hire driver takes you out to the airport he or she has to come back to base empty. That doesn\u2019t make any sense, especially in a country like Germany that is such a leader in all the environmental issues that they play in. So, hopefully, over a period of time, they will recognize that. In Japan, which is the largest Taxi market in the world, we are launching in partnership with Taxi and we are building out our product suite as it relates to Taxi Partners. We are going out and having really good discussions with Taxi Partners and we are signing up Taxi Partners and kind of building of service the organic way and we are optimistic about the potential of Japan as the market and the potential of Taxi as a partner there. There\u2019s some kind of creative ways in which we are working with Taxi which we think can result in pretty good, a pretty good thought services there as well. The Olympics are clearly a consideration for the government, and again, I think that we can play a constructive part and in building out a great business there. Argentina is another market for us that is showing us very, very strong signal and I think is one of the absolute bright lights in South America, and it\u2019s mostly a cash market at this point, but we think has a ton of potential. There are some markets. Italy is very slow in developing. Spain, Barcelona for example has taken a step back. So all of these markets have their positives and negatives, but I think that, overall, they are going to be a net positive and when I look at five years forward, I think, that they will be real contributors into our ecosystem. Youssef Squali : Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from line is David Dillon from SMBC Nikko. Your line is open to you. David Dillon : Thank you. Really nice improvement on this freight side, the 200% growth, can you share the number of trips there? I know you gave some information on the carriers and the drivers and the shippers, but is there any additional metrics you can provide there if possible? Nelson Chai : Actually, no, we are actually not -- we are not giving that kind of information out. But we look at that we have seen good signal there. We were pretty confident terms of the ability to grow out there. We are seeing it just because we see all the same store sales that we are getting with these national shippers. We continue to build out our routes. And as you know, the key to building a good Freight business is building kind of supply-demand across routes which we are building. We are not optimized yet. We are not big enough yet, but we are seeing very, very good traction there. And then, we will look forward to talking more about Freight. Again, we have been in the business a little over a year and a half or so. And again, we think that we will continue to grow -- the growth will continue to exceed 200% for the year. Dara Khosrowshahi : I will just to add a little bit of color. In general, if you look at last year Freight was probably the overall Logistics business was in an undersupply position. This year there\u2019s more supply out there. There are more trucks out there. So pricing has come down. So the real focus of the Freight team now is to really focus on bringing in demand and going out and signing up the enterprise shippers. And that sale team is just really, really knocking it out of park. They are bringing in a lot of names. And usually, well, not usually, almost without exception, when we bring in a new name, we service them very well. We have won a bunch of Kona Shipper of the Year awards, et cetera, and then we build the business. So you are going to see our sales team out there. They are knocking on doors and fortunately the doors are opening at this point. Nelson Chai : Yeah. The only I will add -- one of the real win points for us is just it\u2019s a very manual business if you know the Freight business and so we are able to automate it. And so are the enterprise shipper is like that. So whether the shipping creation like 87% of the time, it\u2019s done electronically. The pricing is done almost 80% electronically and even the booking is done almost 80% electronically and so that wins. And so where we are seeing those benefits out there, and as Dara mentioned, the sales team has been going after it and so we are seeing good signal right now. Dara Khosrowshahi : Great. Thank you, everyone. David Dillon : Okay. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Great. Thank you for the question today and thank you everyone for joining us, and we look forward to catching up with you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Uber Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Mr. Kent Schofield. Sir, the floor is yours. Kent Schofield : Thank you, operator. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber Technologies\u2019 Q2 2019 earnings presentation. On the call today, we have Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO; Nelson Chai, CFO; and this is Kent Schofield, Head of Investor Relations.

Following prepared remarks today, we will open the call to questions. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Kent. We\u2019re proud of the progress we made in Q2 2019 towards becoming the platform of choice for the movement of people and powering global commerce all around the world. During the quarter, we continued to produce strong growth in gross bookings across all of our platform offerings with overall growth of 37% year on year at constant currency producing a $63 billion annual run rate. Adjusted net revenue or ANR was $2.9 billion, up 12% year on year excluding a driver appreciation award non-cash made in connection with our IPO and on a constant currency basis and our accelerated nicely up 26% powered by strongly monthly active platform consumers, or MAPC growth of 30%. Our MAPC growth is continued into the second half of the year and we\u2019re proud to announce that we\u2019ve had 100 million MAPCs in the month of June. Note that we expect ANR growth to continue to accelerate beyond the 30% mark in constant currency during the back half of the year as we continue to grow MAPCs, increased multi-offering users, improved take rates sequentially and with the help of easier comps in the prior year periods. Our Q2 2019 adjusted EBITDA loss came in at $656 million, a big improvement versus Q1 and handily beating our own internal plan due to strong execution of our teams across the businesses. The competitive environment and our position of Ridesharing space continues to be stable to improve. We will take some of that improvement to continue to lead into our Eats business where we see plenty of competition and significant capital investments but incredible potential. While you often have to make trade-offs in life, we believe that we can continue to invest aggressively and grow while driving efficiencies from scale by building great tech to improve effectiveness and from good old-fashioned focus on the bottom line. Our much improved core platform contribution of $220 million in Q2 was driven by increased focus on products, service, tech and brand differentiation in the U.S. and Latin America Ridesharing categories. A more effective deployment of incentives, greater efficiency in shared rides and a focus on higher margin products. Our share ride teams are focusing more of their energy in tech capabilities and driving share ride efficiency rather than simply discounting for volume. This is resulting in a mixed shift into more profitable UberX volumes. We\u2019ll continue to innovate in the shared ride space with exciting new products such as nonstop shared rides, much more sophisticated pricing algorithms and some pretty interesting innovations coming up in the second half of the year. We\u2019re also ramping up our emphasis on consumer segmentation. Uber Rewards, which you\u2019ll recall became available to 100% of the U.S. rides in Eats consumers in March has seen great momentum. Enrolled users are about twice as likely to use both rides and Eats than unenrolled users. Uber Rewards is just one part of a broader suite of loyalty products including Uber Cash, our Uber-branded credit cards and ongoing experimentation with subscription product in rides and Eats.  Uber Comfort, our new premium economy offering, has been a hit and continues to roll out globally. And our Uber for business solution suite grew quite strongly at 60% on a year on year basis. Finally, our Uber Health platform that helps improve access to healthcare organization grew it over 400% year on year this quarter. Now moving to Eats. Q2 2019 MAPC growth of over 140% helps drive 98% year on year gross bookings growth at constant currency to $3.4 billion. While our take rate improved 240 basis points over our Q1 take rate. We made significant progress in expanding restaurant selection with over 315,000 restaurant partners now on the platform at the end of the quarter. We launched several Eats product features during the quarter including pilots, the test subscription, pricing strategies with our most engaged users. We continue to work on improving restaurant onboarding efficiency by reducing friction, including point of sale integration through partnerships such as Olo and custom integration via our own APIs. And lastly, we enabled even more ways for restaurants to engage Eats customers to renew options like dine-in, pick-up and ability to use their own delivery personnel. We continue to be the number one and number two player in online food delivery category in multiple geographies, including the U.S., Japan, France, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand. And in the back half of 2019, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our most strategic Eats markets, lean in on pole marketing programs with partners such as McDonald\u2019s and Starbucks, and accelerate our innovation in restaurant selection engine. We continue to invest and innovate in our other best segment, growing Q2 gross bookings by 160% year-on-year at constant currency to $132 million. Uber Freight continued to see impressive growth and great progress in Q2 despite soft market conditions. And NeMo trips grew triple digits quarter on quarter as we launched in 11 new markets including Paris and Berlin, which have quickly become two of our best performing cities. Finally, in our advanced technologies group, we unveiled our first production car capable of self-driving with Volvo\u2019s newest XC90 SUV. Direct from the factory, the platform is designed with the chassis ready to integrate into ATG\u2019s self-driving system.  And now on to Nelson for some more details on the numbers. Nelson? Nelson Chai : Thanks, Dara. During Q2, our GAAP revenue was $3.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Our GAAP cost of revenues, excluding D&A of $1.7 billion, increased from 55% from 48% of revenue in Q2 2018. GAAP EPS was a loss of $4.72 which was impacted by a $3.9 billion stock-based compensation charge due to restricted stock units as part of our IPO and compares to a loss of $2.01 in Q2 of 2018. For the remainder of the call, unless otherwise noted, I will discuss key operational metric as well as non-GAAP financial measures excluding pro forma adjustments such as our $299 million driver appreciation award and the $3.9 billion stock-based compensation charge both related to the IPO. First, our total company global trips of 1.7 billion, grew 35% year-over-year. Growth is driven principally by international growth in rides and Eats.  MAPC grew 30% year-over-year to $99 million. We continue to see strong new MAPC additions to the platform via Uber Eats and NeMo. Total company gross bookings grew 31% to $15.8 billion and on a constant currency basis grew 37% year-over-year, continued solid growth in Ridesharing gross bookings growth across all our regions led by the U.S. and Latin America. Eats gross bookings growth is driven by strong year-over-year growth in U.S. and Canada and APAC, despite the significant amount of capital that is poured into the space. Adjusted net revenue or ANR excluding the driver appreciation award was $3.2 billion, which was up 26% on a constant currency basis. Core platform ANR excluding the driver appreciation award was $3 billion or up 22% on a constant currency basis. Core Ridesharing ANR was up 70% year-over-year and Eats ANR was up 56% year-over-year and they were up 20% and 60% year-over-year respectively on a constant currency basis. Our core platform ANR as a percentage of gross bookings was 19% versus 21% in Q2 of 2018 primarily due to Eats which has the lower take rate than Ridesharing, growing as a larger percentage of the core mix. And the year-over-year increase in use of Ridesharing incentive, particularly in the U.S. and Latin America. We did increase our core ANR take rate to 19% versus 18% in Q1 this year reflecting more favorable economic conditions in U.S. Ridesharing industry and improved share ride efficiency, and the new service fee structure in Uber Eats in the U.S. which was launched in the end of Q1 which drove the significant quarter-over-quarter take rate improvement of 10.2% from 7.8%. Non-GAAP cost of revenues excluding D&A increased to 47% from 43% of ANR and was flat with Q2 2018 at 9% as a percentage of gross bookings. Cost of the revenue was flat as a percentage of gross booking as improvements in insurance and payment costs were offset by an increase in cost of revenue due to Freights and NeMo\u2019s gross or merchant model where Freight partner payments and NeMo\u2019s scooter hardware and field costs are included in our cost of revenue. Now turning to non-GAAP operating expenses. Operations in support increased to 14% from 13% on an adjusted net revenue and remain flat at 2.9% of gross bookings since second quarter of last year reflecting each higher support, contact rates offsetting efficiency and ride support. Sales and marketing increased to 31% from 26% of ANR and increased to 6.2% from 5.7% of gross bookings versus the second quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to increase consumer promotion as well as increased advertising and marketing head count. However, promotion expense was down quarter-over-quarter, particularly in the U.S. which helped drive the sequential improvement in the second quarter of 2019 from the first quarter of 2019. In July, we put in place a more centralized structure for our global marketing team and an effort to quickly and efficiently build the more consistent external brand narrative across audiences, products and region. As part of this, we made the difficult decision to let go of around 400 marketing personnel, about 1.5% of our total head count. Now on the core platform contribution margin. As a reminder, our core platform contribution margin as the percentage of core platform ANR demonstrates the margin that we generate at the direct expenses related to our Ridesharing and Uber Eats businesses but does not include indirect unallocated R&D and G&A expenses including ATG and other technology programs and our other best segments. Our core platform contribution margin in Q2 of 8% as a percentage of ANR, while this is down versus the year ago, strong execution against our internal plan improvements in share rides efficiency and improved dynamics in certain markets led to an impressive 1,200 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter versus the first quarter of this year. R&D remained flat at 14% ANR and decreased to 2.9% from 3% of gross bookings in the second quarter of 2018. G&A decreased to 14% from 15% of ANR and decreased to 2.8% from 3.3% of gross bookings in the second quarter of last year, but we continue to invest in the system and the infrastructure needed to be a public company, we\u2019re seeing leverage across our platform. In Q2 2019, adjusted EBITDA loss was $656 million. We handily beat our internal EBITDA plan due to strong execution of our teams across the business. We know we have a lot more to work to do here and we continue to focus on balancing investments and profitability improvements. In terms of the liquidity, we ended the quarter with approximately $11.7 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalent and $13.7 billion in both restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. We received the $1 billion in aggregate proceeds from the Toyota, DENSO and SoftBank in July of 2019. So this will be reflected on our Q3 2019 balance sheets. Now, I will wrap up by providing guidance and comments for the first time as a public company. For 2019, gross bookings, we expect constant currency growth of 31% to 35% year-over-year, which translates to an estimated range of $65 billion to $67 billion. Based on June month end rates, our constant currency growth represents about $64 billion to $66 billion in reported gross bookings. We continue to see the rideshare markets remain stable for the balance of the year and monitor closely the competitive dynamics. The Eats market will continue to be competitive as competitors have raised funds invest in growth in its fast growing category. We will continue to invest including in the fourth of 2019 when seasonal career cost increase and expect to see continued strong growth for the balance of the year. As a reminder, competitive intensity for our platform most directly impact take rates and sales and marketing expense. That being said, we expect adjusted net revenue growth rates to improve in the back half of the year. For 2019 adjusted EBITDA, we expect the loss of a range between $3.2 billion and $3 billion. As we are a newly public company, we are also providing additional guidance. For Q3 2019 stock-based compensation, we expected an expense of $450 million to $500 million and we expect our Q3 2019 basic and diluted weighted average share count to be 1.7 billion to 1.725 billion shares. This full year EBITDA guidance reflects continued investments in Eats, Other Bets, ATG and our infrastructure. We believe the profitability of the rides business will prove out. In fact in the second quarter, if we take our rides contribution and is up all of the corporate overhead, which includes the unallocated expensive and tech supporting the entire company excluding ATG. The loss would have been approximately a $100 million in the quarter. Now back over to Dara for the wrap up of the call. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thank you very much, Nelson. We\u2019re pleased with our progress this quarter. We hope to deliver more for you and with that, let\u2019s open up for questions. Kent Schofield : Great. Thanks, Dara. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : Great. Thank you taking my question. I guess, Dara looking at the results, your bookings and riders close to in line, but large beat on the profitability. How are you thinking about balancing the ability to drive the top line bookings versus drive the bottom line? How do you balance that? And then when you think about some of the new competitors entering in London, could that make that decision different going forward and how do you feel about the London situation right now? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Hey, Justin. Good question. Listen, I think you know that the balance between the top and the bottom line is more of an art rather than a science. So I if I told you that we had kind of the scientific formulae that we\u2019re solving for here, we\u2019d be lying to you. That said, if you look at our trip growth on a year-on-year trip growth was 37% Q3 of 2018, 37% Q4, 36% Q1, 35% Q2. So it\u2019s just at these kinds of scale, it\u2019s rare to find this kind of growth and we do think that as we look at our marketing spend, our incentive spend, how we can leverage the business going forward, we think that there\u2019s the opportunity to scale our expenses or be more efficient with our incentive spend or be more efficient with our marketing spend really doubled down on less, smaller kind of projects and doubling down on the channels that are really working for us. So we actually think that if we do our jobs right, there are always tradeoffs to be made in life, but I think that we can make the tradeoffs where we can scale expenses and/or get far more efficient in our marketing and incentive spend while improving the bottom line of the company. And listen, we\u2019re very confident that this company at maturity can be cash flow positive, and the team is focused on being able to drive big-time growth at the top line while getting more efficient on all parts of the business. I think as far as the London competition goes, listen, the London is a great market for us. We are trying our best to be excellent partners with TFL, the regulator there, and intend to continue to build our business in a constructive way. The new competition that we\u2019re seeing in London are frankly competitors that we\u2019re familiar with. We\u2019ve been competing against those players in Paris for many, many years. Our position in Paris is very, very strong. It\u2019s quite a constructive market for us. So with a category of Ridesharing, we are going to have multiple competitors in every country that we compete in. We\u2019re going to have multiple competitors in large markets like Paris and London. But so far we\u2019re not seeing anything in London that\u2019s a surprise or unexpected that we\u2019re not seeing in 20 other cities all around the world. Justin Post : Great. Thanks. Kent Schofield : Thanks, Justin. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Kent Schofield : Operator, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Great, thanks. Dara, on the last earnings call, you talked about earning \u2013 or about the market share in ride hailing sort of reaching a point of stability. I\u2019m curious, as you look at the competitive markets and the rate of growth on some of your main competitors, particularly in markets like the U.S., what\u2019s it take to get to that point of stability? Is it a just a matter of time, is a matter of more investment and sort of how do you \u2013 whether it\u2019s bookings or revenues across the space, sort of how to think of what qualifies as stability. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I think it\u2019s \u2013 listen we \u2013 when we look at the Ridesharing category, our top competitor in this category is car ownership and other ways of getting around. And when I look at how we are faring against car ownership, we\u2019re faring very well. And we continue to invest in product, continuing to kind of improve the efficiency of our POOL product. You\u2019ve seen us bring in transit choices, a whole other host of ways that people can get around their city, so that this younger generation that is coming of age on myself as zero need to own a car. That said, within our category of Ridesharing, we are going to have multiple competitors. We and Lyft are big-time competitors here and have been for some period of time. And for now, we are seeing generally category positions that are stable and we\u2019re focused on improving profitability in this market as many \u2013 and many other markets around the world. And based on what we read, Lyft seems to be focused in a similar way, but as you know, competitive environments can change. But the big picture is we want to be there any way you want to get around your city and I think we\u2019re well on a path to do so in a profitable way. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You are welcome. Kent Schofield : Thank you for the question. Operator, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. I have two. The first one on the U.S. Eats. Curious to hear about sort of any impact at all from elasticity associated with that service fee. And how do you think about potentially rolling it out to other markets in the back half or into next year? And then India Eats, I remember last quarter you called it out as a one of the headwinds to overall ANR. Is there any update on India Eats in the quarter? And how do you think about strategic options to improve your ability to more profitably grow in that market? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I think on the U.S. and elasticity as it relates to the service fee, we\u2019re constantly testing and learning. What we found is, as you can see from the take rate improvement, this is two quarters in a row where you\u2019re seeing very, very substantial take rate improvement on the Eats side. The team is executing well. They\u2019re focused. There is due to be some elasticity, but what I can tell you is that the improvements that we are seeing in our take rate from a revenue standpoint and from a profitability standpoint are significantly in excess of any business that we might be losing on the top line. And of course this is within the context of the top line of our Eats business growing bookings at 90 plus percent on a year on year basis. So, we think that at this scale, and at these kinds of top lines, the kind of trade-off decisions that we\u2019re making are the right trade-off decisions and frankly they\u2019re not too difficult to make. We will look at taking some of these learnings in different markets. Every single market is its own \u2013 has its own character, has it done competitive environment. So at this point, we can\u2019t point to a specific plan or rollout plan. There are certain markets where we\u2019ll introduce the fees and there are certain markets where we won\u2019t and we\u2019ll be pretty disciplined and data driven in our approach to every single market. In terms of India, it\u2019s a big market on the rideshare side in India. We\u2019re very happy with the results there both in terms of category position, the top line and especially the bottom line. And we\u2019re taking some of the lessons and extending them into the Eats category. Right now the market is very, very competitive. There are a few very strong competitors there. Generally, I will tell you that we want to be the number one or number two in every single market. Right now in India, we are the number three, and so the team knows there\u2019s a big lift ahead of them. But we\u2019re in the game and I think India \u2013 what\u2019s great about India is we have a local team there. We\u2019ve got a great engineering team there. We\u2019re kind of a local company in India. We proven our ability to win in rides, and my expectation is the same on Eats side. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks gentlemen. Kent Schofield : Thank you for the question. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Kent Schofield : Operator, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : Hey guys. Just one clarification and then a question around that. So if we back out the 287 million shares for the riders or for the drivers in Q2, your rides net revenue or adjusted net revenue was $2.6 billion and take rate 21.3. So just want to clarify that that\u2019s actually accurate and the right way to handle that 287 and then if so, that take rates up 150 or so sequentially and you mentioned that is going to go up in the back half. So what\u2019s driving up the ride take rate that the U.S., is it Brazil getting less of that, any color on what\u2019s happening with rides take rate both in Q2 and back half of this year. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Hey, Ross. I think, you have gone the numbers right. Nelson, correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Nelson Chai : That is right. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think, listen, on the take rate, we don\u2019t want to get into particulars as far as market by market, but I think the characterization, which is the competitive environment in most of the markets in which we\u2019re competing with are stable or improving or our competitive tactics are improving. I think that\u2019s a generalization that is true in most of the markets out there in the rides category. And that is translating into take rates that are an improvement quarter on quarter. And if things remain the same, we think those trends are healthy and we\u2019ll take them. Kent Schofield : Thank you Ross for the question. Operator, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two if I can. First, Dara you mentioned some interesting innovations coming in the second half. Is there anything you can share with us on kind of where those might fall or any specific there would be great? And then just secondly, SoftBank\u2019s in the process of raising a second Vision Fund. They continue to put money into competitors. So just wondering what kind of dialogue you might have with them to try to bring about more of a healthy market in the space. Anything you could share would be great. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, Lloyd. I would \u2013 the marketing team would kill me if I steal their thunder as far as innovation goes on the POOL side. But on the shared ride category, listen, one of the keys was share rides is you have to create matching efficiency. And we were the pioneer in shared rides to begin with. We were the pioneer in shared rides, the product in shared rides where you walk and wait in order to create greater matching efficiencies, and you should expect more of that pioneering and innovative spirit in share rides going forward. We\u2019re already experimenting in high capacity vehicles, for example, Uber Bus, Uber Van, to kind of { Part \u2013 0-28 } { Spart-028 } matching efficiencies, and you should expect more of that pioneering and innovative spirit in shared rides going forward. We're already experimenting in high capacity vehicles, for example, Uber Bus, Uber Van to kind of take sharing two to three people in the back seat to 10 people in a van, which we think benefits riders, it benefits cities, it benefits the environment. And there's a whole lot of technical kind of innovation and investment that has to go into matching. It's a category that, because of our volumes and basically every single market that we compete with on the rides side where we're the largest player, shared rides tend to be a category where our network effects are amplified. So we want to invest technically behind those network effects. And I think you'll see kind of more matching tests coming up in the back half of the year that we think will hopefully take us to kind of the next growth phase of shared rides.  I think as far as SoftBank and the vision fund 2.0 we're as awed and inspired as everyone else as far as SoftBank's ability to raise capital and put that capital to work. And I said at the first time which is I'm really happy that SoftBank is a partner of ours. I may be even slightly happier now that SoftBank is a partner of ours because a partner that's global, that has so much capital, as someone that you want to have with you, and SoftBank has been a great partner. I think they'll continue to be a partner going forward. We are a sensitive us to industry dynamics, so when we talk to SoftBank, we talk about things that are relevant to us and we leave the investment up to them. Thanks as always for the question. Unidentified Analyst : Alright thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Let\u2019s go to the next question please Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ron Josey : Great thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit more. I think, Dara, you talked about increased consumer promotions this quarter \u2013 sorry more effective to deployment of incentive this quarter. Just want to understand a little bit more particularly as you talked about that promotion has been down and some sequential improvement. So just any information around promotion and incentives should be helpful. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, we don't want to get into too many details because you're entering into competitive categories. But there are two factors going on. One is there has always spend that is kind of an inefficient side of incrementality, kind of the next dollar that you put to work, the incremental return tends to be worse. And we've got our engineers and marketing folks always looking for the least efficient incremental spend and then testing and learning their way into more efficient types of spend going forward. So you've got kind of engineers and marketers rinsing and repeating there. And I do think that we are coming with types of incentives that are designed not just to drive volume for the next week, but they're designed to drive volume for the next month or two months and increasingly investing more in programs like our loyalty program both Uber Pro on our drivers side but then Uber Rewards which are designed to essentially invest money for loyalty that carries over for not months, but hopefully years. So it's a continuing process. At the same time we are seeing the competitive environment in general, be more constructive and listen that always helps as well. The combination of better science, better marketing, and a more constructive environment, we think makes for a decent to hopefully better than decent second half for us. Ron Josey : Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Kent Schofield : Thanks Ron for the question. Operator next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from line of John Blackledge with Cowen. John Blackledge : Great. Two questions. First just curious about the pricing environment in the U.S. also the ability to raise prices and/or potential for raising prices as we ramp through the year on the Ridesharing side. And then just second on the marketing team change, just any early thoughts on how it may impact brand spend or customer acquisition spend. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Hey John as far as the pricing power and pricing in general in the U.S. we're constantly testing and learning in terms of pricing. I do think that we have pricing power as a category as to what's the best way to exercise that pricing power one way or the other, I think, it remains to be seen and we don't want to talk too much about kind of what our intentions are going forward. But I think as a service we have pricing power. And I think it will, in a year or two, our ability to grow this business for many, many years to come.  As far as marketing and what we're doing, listen, part of the design around the restructuring of the marketing team was really looking at where we came from. Really the marketing team grew organically. And based on kind of the history of how Uber grew up, Uber was very decentralized from a local base of businesses essentially, business leaders and city leaders who were their own CEOs. And over a period of time as businesses grow, as they become more consistent, it makes sense to centralize some of the capabilities and the decentralization that served as very, very well early on in our development as a company to some extent hurt us as we think about how we tune our marketing teams for the next five years. A significant amount marketing as you can imagine happens, for example, online on big online global systems, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, et cetera, these are all essentially technical global platforms. And to have a bunch of local teams, all of whom are starting from square one engaging with these technical global platforms in their own ways and reinventing the wheel, did make sense. So the reorganization is about improving effectiveness and it's about thinking about where we're going to be for the next five years for the company versus where we come from. And I think, listen, my expectation is that our marketing spend, I can't speak for the second half of the year, but our marketing spend for the next few years is actually going to both increase and be more effective as a result of the changes that we're making in the marketing organization. Kent Schofield : Great John, thanks for the question. Operator next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Kent Schofield : Mark, are you on the line? You might be on mute. Dara Khosrowshahi : Operator, why don't we go ahead and come back to Mark? Can we go to the next question please? Operator : Yes. Your next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson with Needham & Company. Brad Erickson : Hi, thanks. I think there's a fair amount of work being done at the city and local government level around the world to understand, I guess, the effect of mobility platforms you are having on broader transportation in those cities. So relative to the some of those works that are ongoing and the conversations you are you all are having in those cities and local governments, how should we think about any impact either positive or negative with regards to supply TNCs are controlled in more cities here going forward. Dara Khosrowshahi : Listen, I think that it's \u2013 every conversation that we are having with every city is different, so it's difficult to give you a global answer. In general, what I can tell you that the great news is we're actually have been dialogue and constructive dialogue with many of the cities and many of the transportation authorities in these cities. So if you look at London, for example, we have a clean air plan and a plan to actually fund electrifying our fleet which is obviously great for the environment, I think it\u2019s great for London, it\u2019s great for consumers, and it's great for us. And that is a result of terrific dialogue with the city. We are now in dialogue with multiple transit operators and we have a transit product that's live, that is actually feeding demand into public transit, which we think is again a good thing for us, it's a good thing for the city and a certainly a great thing for public transit as well. We are now having active dialogue in terms of sharing our data. Obviously we don't share any personal data for riders, but sharing aggregated traffic data that will allow cities to design more effectively for the next five years in a smarter, better way. So I think the dialogue that we're having, this dialogue will turn into what we think are constructive results. There are some cities with whom the dialogue unfortunately, we think is not constructive. New York is one of them. But I think that the majority of these conversations are positive. And we want to be a partner. And the best partner for cities going forward as it relates to their transportation solution for the next 10 years. Kent Schofield : Great Brad, thank you for the question. Brad Erickson : Welcome. Kent Schofield : Next question please. Operator : Yes, your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thanks. Sorry about that. Hey, could we just talk about \u2013 Dara, could you talk a little bit about the two regulatory fronts, New York City, what's happened to demand the profitability of the Uber Platform in New York City over the last couple of months as these series of changes have been introduced? And then just comment on the likelihood or the outcome materiality with these \u2013 the California, the pending legislation in California about changing people from contract to full time employees and what kind of impact that could have? You could address both of those please. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, sure Mark. So listen, I think that a lot of the changes that have been introduced or potentially introduced in New York City we just don't agree with. The city's essentially introducing another medallion system. And if you've read any of the articles in the New York Times, you know that that system is right for abuse by people in power and it's happened in the past and the city could be setting itself up. Again if you look at our business in New York, it's pretty healthy and it continues to grow. The problem is that we are growing fastest in areas of the city where you've got consumers who can afford significantly higher prices and the price increases that we have had to go forward in the city while areas like East New York, or Wakefield, Bronx or Central Harlem are not growing because our consumers there can't afford the increases in prices. And as a result, we're making kind of mobility unavailable to them. So I think anyone who thinks that the changes \u2013 who tells you that the changes in New York City are good is malarkey frankly. And even [indiscernible] appointed TNC commissioners, they acted over the gesture of city council, and drivers, and editorial boards, and community groups and even the former TNC Chair and transit experts. So we think frankly we don't get it. But we are doing our best in New York City. I think one of the issues that we hold here as it relates to Uber and our system is that Uber has always been an open labor system. We've always been available to anybody who wants to find labor on our system, make money on our system, any which way they can. And the new rules could potentially restrict where, when, how drivers can work. And we just don't think that's good for New Yorkers. As far as California and AB 5, listen if AB 5 passes, it'll simply be a codification of existing law. It doesn't immediately transform drivers into employees. It just changes kind of the legal text in the court. We think that there's a better way forward. The fact is that our drivers consistently tell us that the reason why they value Uber is they value their freedom, they're their own boss, they run their own business, they can drive for us or not drive for us, whenever they want, however they want. And we do think that there is a better path forward that would allow drivers to keep their status, independent status, but as a counter protection that frankly, we think are good protections. These are like minimum earnings and benefits and a voice in kind of decisions as it relates to the system that would affect their livelihood. So we think there's a win-win there. And we're having dialogue with various parties to hopefully get to win-win. And we think that will be the way forward. So stay tuned. We're hoping that the dialogue is a constructive dialogue, but it's early. Kent Schofield : Thank you, Mark for the question. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Dara. Kent Schofield : Operator, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Michael Graham with Canaccord. Michael Graham : Thank you. I just wanted to ask on public transit again, you mentioned launching in London and Boston. Any update on rider engagement with that part of the platform either in those cities or in some of the places you've been a little bit longer. And is this a city relations thing primarily and a rider convenience thing? Or is there a business opportunity there as well in a direct way? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes Michael it\u2019s very early. But what we are seeing, which is super encouraging is that transit options and frankly more options, more transportation options in our app increase engagement with Uber app. So it's more transit, more bikes and scooters even in certain cases Uber Bus, et cetera, all of these additions, for example, taxi is a very, very fast growing category for us in certain parts of the world as well. As we add in more transportation options, we become a factor in a larger percentage of the population's transportation decisions. We have a great products and technical teams that can build these solutions in an artful, simple way that over a period of time learn about you and can personalize the choices for you. So the transit option is just one way in which we are increasing our relevance to a greater number of consumers on a global basis. And we are seeing it in higher engagement in the app specifically with London and some of the other areas where we've grown transit. And listen, we think it\u2019s good for consumers, we think it's good for us and we think it's good for mass transit and the city as well. So, this one is a win-win, win, but it's pretty early and we think there's going to be a lot of kind of testing and learning going forward as we build these products. Michael Graham : Great, thank you. Kent Schofield : Thanks Michael. Operator, next question please. Operator : You next question comes from the line of Benjamin Black with Evercore ISI. Benjamin Black : Hey thanks for the question. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the six focus countries. Where are you seeing meaningful traction? Where the incremental work to be done? What does the competitive environment look like in some of these countries? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes sure. We can certainly give you a quick tour around the countries. Listen, Argentina is a very strong market for us. Buenos Aires continues to be one of our biggest and fastest growing markets in the world. And we think that there is a constructive regulatory momentum in the country and we hope to build on that momentum. Germany is another great market for us. We are building our business in Germany in the right way as it relates to rideshare. What's interesting is that we launched our Jump bikes in Berlin and they've been spectacular. They\u2019ve been a huge hit in the city. I think that bike ridership in Europe is more prevalent. And we're certainly seeing it with our product as well. And what you see with us in Germany is an expansion into more cities, both on the ride side and on the bike side as well. And listen we're actually getting into Germany with freight as well. So Germany we think is going to be a pretty interesting market for us.  Japan and Korea, are a couple of other markets. These are taxi-heavy markets. We think that regulatory the regulatory environment in both markets continuing to improve, although we have a long way to go to build the ride, big rides business. I will tell you that our Eats business in Japan is doing incredibly well. And in Japan, I think, we will be in Eat first and then ride second business, which is terrific. It goes to some of the flexibility that we have in our model as far as introducing the Uber brand into the market, and then expanding the definition of what Uber means to consumers in that market. Spain has had good parts and bad parts. Barcelona, the regulations in Barcelona and a couple of the eastern regions were not great. But honestly, the rest of the Spain is doing incredibly well. We're growing well there in the right category and we're starting to invest in Eats as well. And so that's going well. So I think most of the story around these markets are strong. Italy is an area where we haven't really developed a big business there. But I'll take where we are and I take five of the six countries. These are some pretty big countries. They're all going to take a lot of work, but they're all showing promise in different ways. Benjamin Black : Great. Kent Schofield : Benjamin, thank you for the question. Benjamin Black : Thank you. Kent Schofield : Operator, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson with Raymond James. Justin Patterson : Great, thank you very much. Maybe a big picture one. Dara you've been involved with a variety of Internet businesses over the course of your career. Could you talk about how scaling Uber differs from traditionally online businesses? And how should we think time line of those financial benefits?  And then as a quick follow-up, can you provide an update around how you're thinking about opportunities around payments? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. I'll take the first and Nelson, maybe you can talk on the payment side. Listen, I think that, there are ways in which Uber is a unique beast and in ways in which it is like any other business. I think that there's a meme around which is can Uber ever be profitable? I certainly heard that that meme along with others. And I'll tell you, we have a business in the rides area that has a 20 plus percent take rate, which is a very, very strong take rate and a business at scale the way we are a global business at scale that has network effect with a 20 plus percent take rate, I believe has the potential. And if we execute, should turn out to be a spectacular business long-term. And I think that the same goes for Eats and we're making bets in a lot of other categories that carry with that incredible potential. So it's hard to compare Uber to other businesses because it's a unique entity. It's one of those rare brands in the world. I think what's very interesting about Uber is that we're a digital and physical business, and so the connectivity between the digital and the physical world and local regulatory bodies and at the presence that we need in every single city, and the difference in kind of local customs, all of those are amplified as it relates to this business, that makes it all the more interesting and to some extent also makes for pretty interesting barriers for entry once you build the business. So I think that myself and my team are well-prepared. But I think we're very, very early in this incredible journey. But Nelson, do you want to talk about payments? Nelson Chai : The only thing I'd add to that is if you listen to the script at the end of the script when I talk about our rides contribution in the second quarter and so we had a very strong second quarter on the rise contribution. And again if you deducted that from what we call our corporate overhead, which is all the unallocated corporate overhead and texts according to the entire company excluding what we invest in ATG, the loss would have been $100 million. So it should give you a little bit of sense of the path to profitability on the rides business. And then obviously we'll have plenty of dialogs and some of the investments were making whether it be in Eats or Freight or in NeMo or around autonomous. But it should give you guys a sense of kind of the path we're moving and we talk about healthy growth in the market environment. Your second question on payments, we continue to make good progress. I would say the team has done a very, very good in terms of reducing some of the payment card fees. A lot of it is working with our partners and we've been able to reduce some of the things. And it literally has been better than we would have expected both on a quarter-on-quarter and a year-on-year basis. As we move towards the next phase of the payments, we are going to be testing, broadening out some of the capabilities particularly in Latin America. And again we think this will have beneficial impact particularly in terms of driver retention. As we offer more tools to allow them to kind of operate every day and also try to take cash out of some markets like Brazil where we think that also provides some safety benefit. Justin Patterson : Great, thank you. Kent Schofield : Thank you for the questions Justin. Operator next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein : Thanks, two questions. Anything you can share to help us understand the early impact of the loyalty program and its impact on repeat usage or retention? And then just around Eats, do you expect to deploy batching other dynamics to improve Eats delivery efficiency in the near term, or is that something more longer term given the complexity to do that? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes Jason as far as our loyalty programs go, we are definitely observing what I would call interesting behavior with our consumers. We're really looking for increased retention, increased spend. So we're seeing both. I think that identifying cause \u2013 causal versus correlative behavior is harder and takes time. But you can expect with the expansion of our loyalty programs in the U.S. and into other markets, you should assume that we're expanding it because we like what we see. As far as each batching goes, we're batching our orders now. And we're using kind of the efficiency in the marketplace. And I think that you should expect to see more bathing going forward as we create increase matching the same way that we build POOL over the past couple of years. Kent Schofield : Okay, t Jason. Operator, next question please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Masha Kahn with HSBC. Masha Kahn : Hi, thanks for the opportunity. Wanted to ask you about some user reports about you going to grocery delivery, if you could comment on that. And the other one from the Eats perspective, what makes it very interesting country or unit perspective which country you like better than the others? Can you maybe characterize some of the aspects of what makes Eats a good business in a certain markets? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes Masha, as far as grocery, I don't want to comment too much other than we have said in the past that we are going to look at additional categories that can take advantage of fulfillment network essentially that we are building and can take advantage of the fulfillment network essentially that we are building and can give our couriers and drivers high utilization and higher work especially during non-peak times, as it relates to driving. So grocery could be one of those categories hypothetically. And once we have something announced we'll definitely tell you about it, but it's something that we could take a look at. Nelson you want to talk. Nelson Cha : Sure. And it tends to be more city by city than just strict country. And a lot of it just has to do with how fast we're in there and then our competitive position. So what I would say is that you heard us talk about a 10.2% take rate, if you will, for Eats in the second quarter. If you look at the top five cities around the world where we are, but those take rates range between 8% and 16%. And so you'll see \u2013 we do have some markets and somebody asked earlier about India where you have a very, very low or negative take rate. But again, we think it can be an attractive business in a lot of those different parts of the market. And so in most of the markets we're in and we have some where we are very pretty strong category position, those tend to be the ones where you'll see that those kinds of high take rates in contribution. Masha Kahn : Okay, thank you. Kent Schofield : Masha thank you for the question. Operator, we'll go ahead and take our last question. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of David Dillon with SMBC. David Dillon : Hi, thank you for the question. Just following-up on that ATG, you have nice expansion there on the take rate despite more competitive pricing environment you're talking about and new competitors coming to market. And just kind of triangulating that with what you said about Japan and nice growth there. And would you expect that take rate to have \u2013 to be sustainable here or possibly continue expand in the back half of 2019? Nelson Chai : Yes. It's Nelson. We hope so, right? So I can report in a service fee in the U.S. at the end of the first quarter and so think there will be a bit of a tailwind as we continue in the back half of the year. Obviously we're going to watch India. So if you think about the fact that our take rate is 10.2%, ex-India probably would have been another 100 basis points or so. The one thing that we do watch and there is seasonality in the fourth quarter particularly has to do with drivers and careers. And so we will have to watch that in terms of what impacted it. But we do think over time that we'll be able to continue to improve in terms of our take rates. David Dillon : Thank you for fitting me. Appreciate it. Nelson Chai : Thanks David. Kent Schofield : So with that, thank you, everyone, for joining us. I wanted to give a special thank you to all of our Uber employees all around the world. This is their first full quarter as a public company. We're entering a different phase now, Uber. From an execution basis, I think, that everyone is putting their best foot forward, and I think it certainly you showed this quarter with revenue accelerating and bottom line getting better. And I think the team will be not satisfied with anything but these kinds of results going forward. So thank again for joining us and we'll talk to you next quarter.

Following prepared remarks today, we will open the call to questions. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks Emily. And thank you all for joining today. And pleased about our continued progress towards unlocking value from our platform and fulfilling vision of becoming the operating system for consumers' everyday lives in cities around the world. First, I'll discuss our Rides business which reached two very significant milestones in Q3. We achieved $1 billion in weekly gross bookings and we generated Rides adjusted EBITDA $631 million, up 52% year-on-year. Importantly, Rides adjusted EBITDA now more than covers our corporate overhead which consists of $623 million in corporate G&A and platform R&D spend. We continue to be the Rides leader in every region in which we operate growing or maintaining category position in our most important markets, including the US, LATAM and the UK, while significantly improving our Rides adjusted EBITDA margins from 17.8% of ANR in Q3, 2018 to 22% in this quarter. Moving forward, we expect to drive continued top-line and margin growth by investing in our marketplace, doubling down on our premium product offerings, as well as continued financial discipline. For example, investment in our enterprise products has driven Uber for business growth exceeding 70%, while expansion of our premium comfort product to more than 150 cities globally has been a win for riders and drivers. Additionally, we've made meaningful progress on a number of our high priority markets such as Germany, Japan and Argentina, Our teams are confident that they can drive strong top and bottom line growth over the next several years. Second, our Eats business continues to expand globally with growth bookings growing 77% and ANR growing 109% year-on-year on a constant currency basis, as a result of continued improvement on our Take Rate which grew to 10.7% from 9% this quarter last year. Our strategy for Eats is simple, invest aggressively into markets where we're confident we can establish or defend a number one or number two position over the next 18-months. We believe that the scale and strength of our global brand, our planned expansion into new local commerce categories like grocery and the power of our platform to cross-promote and drive loyalty within our product lines, all afford us superior acquisition and per transaction economics compared to mono line local players. Many of the startups in the food category have been trying to use cheap capital to buy their way to growth. But we've seen the capitals getting more expensive and can run dry, whereas platform leadership is both far cheaper and more permanent when coupled with excellent execution. We believe that the online food delivery category could under grow the same move to more favorable market conditions that we've observed in Rides as companies\u2019 content with public market investors. A few weeks ago, we announced the majority investment in Cornershop, a leading provider of online grocery delivery in Mexico and Chile. Given the tremendous synergies between restaurant delivery and grocery, we see significant value in adding an already established and highly successful grocery after our platform further solidifying Uber as the operating system for everyday life in Latin America and potentially beyond, Our recent announcement that we will begin showing Rides, Eats and other services side by side in one app demonstrates the clear advantages of our platform approach. We can more quickly and efficiently attract and retain customers, as well as deepen their engagement by linking and cross promoting all of our offerings. It's early days but we've already launched products like Uber pass, a subscription that provides all-in-one savings like ride protection, $0 delivery fee on Uber Eats orders and more for customers intensities. Similarly, Uber rewards which reach 18 million subscribers in the US in just six months since launch should drive increased loyalty as consumers accumulate and use Uber rewards across our platform. Finally, we're focused on turning our ride users into eat users and as part of the changes we made to our marketing organization have structured teams around seizing high potential opportunities like this. Lastly, a word on regulations. Ensure the best outcome for riders, drivers and the cities in which we operate, we continue to be focused on positive, productive engagement with regulators all around the world. It's important to remember where we came from. When we launched peer-to-peer ride sharing in 2013, California was the only place in the world with regulations on the books. Fast forward to today just six years later, nearly every major market in the world has recognized and licenses our service. Nonetheless regulations in California have generated a lot of interest over the past few months, so I want to briefly address our situation there. For context California represents 9% of our global rise in Eats gross bookings but a negligible amount of Rides and Eats adjusted EBITDA respectively. We continue to focus on a path that we believe provides a very attractive option for drivers and couriers where they retain flexibility but gain important new protections like healthcare subsidies and minimum earning standards. Together with Lyft and DoorDash, we're putting a ballot measure to California voters in November 2020 that proposes just such a model. I also want to highlight the significant progress we made on policy across the world this year, positive independent contractor rulings from both the US via Department of Labor letter in April and Brazilian Federal Government. The passage of the mobility law in France which includes a reaffirmation of independent classification and a return to Vancouver after seven years away. Generally speaking, our priorities remain the same. Secure regulations that allow the business to grow and enable individuals to find flexible earnings opportunities on our platform. Before I turn on over to Nelson for details on the numbers, I want to speak to the excellent progress we made on Rides since our IPO as this was our best quarter ever and the first in which we've disclosed our second level EBITDA. In just two quarters since our IPO, we made a lot of progress. Since Q1, we've doubled Q3 Rides ANR to 24% on a constant currency basis, that's ANR to 24% on a constant currency basis. We improved our Rides take rate by 200 basis points to 22.8% producing an incremental $300 million in Q3, 2019 ANR. Our transaction growth along with a better take rate has improved ANR by $500 million, $400 million of which flowed through to Rides adjusted EBITDA. This represents an 80% incremental EBITDA flow through increasing adjusted EBITDA margins from 8% to 22% in just two quarters. We've achieved this with an improved framework on capital allocation, efficiency, capability and cost control. As an example, we again reduced insurance and payments, the two biggest components of our cost of revenue quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year as a percentage of gross bookings. We did all this and achieve the same quarter-on-quarter top-line growth rate this Q3 as Q3 of last year despite a $2 billion increase in gross bookings for the quarter. To be clear, we're not done by a long shot in our Rides segment and we are as we speak applying the same level of rigor to all of our other segments including Eats. We've already made some tough decisions regarding our headcount and resource allocation to make sure we've got the very best teams working against the highest return projects, and will continue to be disciplined and efficient with our capital. Our current target with a ton of hard work from all of our teams is to get to total company EBITDA profitability for the full year 2021 as we see the benefits of global scale and efficiency and the best tech talent out there. The world's magical companies are the ones that can compound top-line growth of massive scale, improve margins, allocate capital efficiency and do the right thing for all of their constituencies. We're working hard to be one of those magical companies. And now to Nelson for more details on the numbers. Nelson Chai : Thank Dara. We are continuing with our financial results. I wanted to describe some of the changes we've made to our report. We now provide greater visibility into our business by reporting on five segments. For each of these segments, we're providing gross bookings, revenue, adjusted net revenue, segment adjusted EBITDA. Our historical total company results remain unchanged. Our segment adjusted EBITDA measures replace, it was previous reported of contribution profit and loss and maintains the same definition and includes all the segment's direct cost with contra revenue, cost of revenue, support and operations, sales and marketing and G&A and R&D directly related to these respective segments, which represents a majority of our total G&A and R&D spend. The further information on these changes and to address any questions on bridging our old and new segments, please see the supplemental slides posted on investor.uber.com. For the remainder of this discussion, all growth rates reflect year-over-year growth unless otherwise noted. Now on to our GAAP results for Q3, 2019. Our GAAP revenue was $3.8 billion, up 30%. GAAP cost per revenue excluding G&A of $1.9 billion decreased 48.8% from 51.3% of revenue in Q3, 2019. GAAP EPS was a loss of $0.68 compared to a loss of $2.21 in Q3 of 2018. For the remainder of the call unless otherwise noted, I will discuss key operational metrics as well as non -GAAP financial measures excluding pro forma adjustments such as stock based compensation and the one-time driver appreciation award associated with the IPO in the second quarter of 2019. Our total company global trips of 1.8 billion grew 31%. Global trip growth continues to be a significant driver of our overall growth in gross bookings. MAPC or Monthly Active Platform consumers were 103 million, up 26%. We continue to see strong new MAPC additions to the platform via Eats and rides. Total company gross bookings were $16.5 billion growing 29% or 32% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted net revenue or ANR was $3.5 billion which is up 35% on a constant currency basis. Our ANR take rate was 21.5% of gross bookings, up 60 basis points year-over-year and a 140 basis points quarter-over-quarter. non-GAAP cost of revenues excluding G&A decreased to 45% and 47% of ANR, and decreased to 9.7% from 9.9% as a percentage of gross bookings. Insurance and payment as a percent of the gross bookings improved quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. This is partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue due to freight and NeMo's gross or merchant's model, where freight partner payments and NeMo's scooter hardware and field costs are included in our cost of revenue. Turning now to non-GAAP operating expenses. First, I'll start with operations and support and sales and marketing which are 100% allocated to our five business segments. Operations and support was stable at 13% of adjusted net revenue and has been stable at 3% of gross booking since the third quarter of 2018, reflecting ongoing rides, support efficiency improvements, offset by mix shift a higher percentage of Eats transactions which carry with them a higher contact rate. Going forward, we will look to automate a higher percentage of Eats customer service tickets and are already seeing reductions in contact rates month-over- month. Sales and marketing increased to 30% from 28% of adjusted net revenue and increased to 6.5% from 5.9% of gross bookings versus a third quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily due to increase consumer promotions as well as increased advertising and marketing spend prior to our Q3 headcount reduction. R&D decreased to 13% from 14%, and adjusted net revenue decreased to 2.8% and 3% of gross booking due to slower growth in ETG expenses. We expect to get leverage on total R&D over the long term. G&A was flat at 15% of adjusted net revenue and remained flat at 3.1% of gross booking versus Q3 of 2018. It was flat as a percentage of our top line as a result of public company infrastructure investment. We expect that G&A will grow significantly more close than our top line. Our Q3, 2019 total adjusted EBITDA loss was $585 million. We handily beat our internal plan due to strong execution of our scheme; we know we have a lot more work to do here and will need focus on balancing investment with profitability improvement. Now I'll provide additional detail on our segments. First on the Rides side. Rides gross bookings of $12.8 billion grew 22% at constant currency led by the US and LATAM respectively. Rides ANR of $2.9 billion grew 24% at constant currency driven by more favorable market dynamics in the US, stability in LATAM beginning in the 2019 and improved share of rise efficiency. Rides adjusted EBITDA was $631 million or 22% of Rides ANR. This represented a quarterly record on absolute dollars and margins basis, with 270 basis point and 420 basis point margin improvements quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year respectively, as the percentage of ANR. During Q3, 2019, the adjusted EBITDA margins for the top five Rides countries by gross bookings range from 17% to 62% as a percent of ANR. There's nothing structurally different about the highest margin country that would prevent other countries from matching as market dynamics become more favorable over time. On each gross booking of $3.7 billion grew 77% at constant currency driven by growth in APAC and US and Canada which was our largest absolute dollar growth driver by category growth slowing in some core metros. Eats ANR was $392 million, up 109% on a constant currency basis through the ongoing benefit from the service fee structure launched in the US in Q1 of 2019. These adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $316 million or negative 81% of ANR and negative 8.6% of gross bookings. We have nearly a 100 Eats cities that are adjusted EBITDA margin positive, with that said given the large private capital inflows into the online food delivery category, competition has been fierce in some markets. To underscore the levels of promotion and incentives by privately funded players approximately 15% of our Eats gross booking make up over half of our adjusted EBITDA margin loss. Our decision recently to exit the South Korean market demonstrates our willingness to exit markets with low ROI. Our freight business grew ANR over 78% and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $81 million. Freight growth was driven by load volume increases over 100% in spite of soft market conditions. Rate continues to rapidly take share in the large US market, while providing excellent service that lays the groundwork for long term shipper partnerships. Our team continues to automate what was high-touch, phone driven tasks to scale our enterprise relationships and increasingly our self-serve, small super platform and to expand our carrier footprint across individual, as well as fleet owners. Our Other Bets segment had ANR of $38 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $72 million. Other Bets which consist primarily of our JUMP e-bikes and scooters continue to be a strong consumer acquisition channel. We also continue to achieve improvements to unit economics. ATG adjusted EBITDA was a loss of a $124 million based on this quarter's level of investment the recent $1 billion investment in ATG covers about eight quarters of spend. The first engineers from Toyota and Denso are now co-located with our ATG teams in Pittsburgh demonstrating Toyota's commitment to this partnership. We also announced that ATG will begin manual testing and mapping in Dallas in early November. In Q3, 2019 corporate G&A and platform R&D of $623 million which represents the G&A and R&D not allocated to one of our five segments grew 24%. This is made up of G&A and engineering functions that support the entire platform, including infrastructure payments brand and customer support technologies. In terms of liquidity, we ended the quarter with approximately $12.7 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalent, an increase of $1 billion over last quarter. The increase was driven by the $1 billion in aggregate proceeds from the investment in ATG and proceeds from our $1.2 billion senior notes offering which closed in September. Now I'll wrap up providing guidance and comments. We are narrowing our 2019 gross bookings to a constant currency growth of 33% to 35% year-over-year, up from the 31% to 35% year-over-year guidance given on the second quarter conference call. Based on September month end rates, our current constant currency growth represents about $64 billion to $65 billion in reported gross bookings. Please note that we expect to provide 2020 annual guidance on our Q4, 2019 earnings call. For your modeling purposes, please keep in mind that our largest foreign currencies are the Brazilian reals, the UK pound, Australian dollar, Mexican pesos, Canadian dollar, euro, Indian rupee and Argentinian peso. Given the rapid improvement in Rides take rates through Q3, 2019, we do not expect typical Q4 seasonality to cause quarter-over-quarter decline in take rate. The Eats market will continue to be competitive as players of raised funds to invest in growth in this fast-growing category. We will continue to invest including in Q4, 2019 when seasonal courier cost increase and we expect category take rates to contract quarter-over-quarter. We expect adjusted net revenue growth rates to continue to accelerate into Q4 coming in close to 40%. For 2019 adjusted EBITDA, we now expect the loss of $2.9 billion to $2.8 billion, reflecting a $250 million improvement at the midpoint from prior guidance of 3.2 to 3.0. We are also providing additional guidance. For the fourth quarter of 2019, stock based compensation, we expect the expense of $250 million to $300 million and we expect our Q4, 2019 basic and diluted weighted average share count to be 1.7 billion to 1.725 billion. As we finalize our 2020 plan, we remain particularly focused on identifying additional operating efficiencies across all of our operating expenses. While we will continue to invest in our business to achieve long term top line growth as Dara mentioned, we are targeting EBITDA profitability on a fully consolidated basis for the full year 2021. We will confirm our 2020 guidance on our Q4 call. With that let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. JasonHelfstein: Hey, thanks for taking the call. Maybe the first one and I don't know if you can comment on it, but clearly a lot of questions around this lock up, if there's anything you can say about discussions you may be having with shareholders to try to manage the lock-up. Secondly, we did see a kind of disappointing Eats in the quarter from a gross bookings basis. You did allude to competitive factors, but yet we did see a better take rate. So are you kind of managing the outcome in Eats ANR relative to Eats gross bookings? Thank you. NelsonChai: So, Jason, I'll take the first one, the one thing I did want to say is I made a comment on my guidance of regarding the rapid improvement of ANR take rate through Q3, 2019. So I just want to clarify. So we do not expect - we do expect -sorry the Q4 seasonality caused some quarter-over-quarter decline. So I just want to make sure I clarify that for the record. Regarding your first question on lockup, yes, it is true that there are a lot of shares that are going to become unlocked on Wednesday. And yes, you can assume that we've had a lot of dialogue and very active dialogue with a lot of the shareholders that we have. I can't really comment on what each and any individual shareholder will do. I would tell you that we have very good and constructive dialogue with long-term shareholders. As you know, there are a number of different holders who have been in the stock for a long time and so you should expect that people will react rationally. As you also know, we've had a lot of very good long-term holders come into the stock. And again, we've had very constructive dialogue as well there. And so obviously there's a lot of supply that can hit the marketplace and we don't know what's going to really happen. But you can rest assured we've taken whatever steps we can to have the dialogue that we need to with most of the parties. DaraKhosrowshahi: Yes. And I think on your Eats questions in terms of the trade offs, listen, there are always trade-offs that you make in terms of investment and growth taking a perspective though this is Eats grew 77% bookings on a year-on-year basis, ANR was up a 109% year-on-year as well. We are still, knowing our own numbers, the largest player globally ex China despite some Twitter speak, from some of our competitors. So the scale of Eats is still very significant and we will actively make trade-offs in this business. We absolutely believe in the ultimate size of the East platform, but as we said we are going to make trade-offs. We're going to shoot to get to number one and number two in every market that we're in. If we can't make it to that level, we'll look to dispose or we'll get out of the market. And once we get to that number one or number two position, we think the power the platform, the Uber brand, our ability for the Rides business and the Eats business to work together to acquire customers and to retain customers will just be advantage over the other competitors out there. So are we going to be disciplined about growth? Absolutely. We did lean in Q3 in Eats, will continue to lean in for the balance of the year. But we are seeing some of the market rationalization, some early signs of market rationalization and discipline. And we think that will be a positive factor for everyone involved. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. BrianNowak: Thanks for taking my question. I've two. Just - the first question just on the comments around full year 2021 profitability. Was there maybe sort of, would you talk us through a little bit the biggest sources of leverage, do you still see in the P&L, as you kind of go down the consolidated P&L to get us to profitability in 2021 and how do you think about Rides profitability improving and Eats getting to breakeven over that period? And then Dara just kind of go back to your question about potential rationalization in Eats, any help at all on what signs you are seeing or what regions of the globe you are seeing, early encouraging signs of rationalization there? Thanks. NelsonChai: So I'll take the first part and Dara will take the second part. So with the new disclosure you can get a sense of the big pools that we're investing in, the five different segments. Yes, we do - we have seen the markets continue to improve on the Rides side of the business. We believe that they will continue to be constructive and so I think you'll see a further improvement there. We do believe that and Dara will comment a little bit on where we think Eats will go over time. I would caution and say that at least over the next couple quarters, we still see a lot of money flowing into that segment, but as you know, when we were on the road we talked to investors about the opportunity, the potential for the Rides business to become much more constructive and we've seen over a couple of quarters how quickly it is improved. And so we think there's a road map out there regarding that. And regarding some of the investments we are making whether it is in ebikes and e-scooters or freight. As you know, we are investing in a number of different bets as we like we call them internally and we do expect some either rationalization or optimization of those bets as we continue to go down and move towards 2021, and so we're still in the middle of our planning mode but that is definitely where we're headed. DaraKhosrowshahi: Yes. I think the on Eats side, certainly one sign that we're seeing that's encouraging is our take rate continuing to move up for Eats and we think ultimately the mature business model for Eats will have taken rates that are significantly higher than a takes rates that you see now. We're not counting on rationalization near-term in Q4, but we do think that all of these markets need to rationalize and as Nelson talked about the Rides rationalization has happened much faster I think than anyone expected and we have a ton under our own control as far as our own business model, how we use technology in automation to drive per unit margins. How we make sure that we scale on an operating basis in terms of our overheads and our G&A and how we get more efficient. I think we've demonstrated some of that in Rides EBITDA improvements in Q3 and frankly we think that there's a long way to go both for a Rides segment and our Eats segment going forward. We've got plans and now we've got to execute but we're confident that we can do so. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. HeathTerry: Just one thing I wanted to clarify on the 2021 profitability. Was that 2020 profitability in 2021 meaning for the full year or for a quarter or at some point in 2021? And then, Nelson, when you look at this the expense reductions that have you been able to take during the third quarter. Is there a way that you can quantify for us sort of where the run rate of efficiencies that you've been able to achieve are so not what we saw in Q3 but if you were to look at sort of the full quarter or maybe even sort of full year impact of those efficiencies or those cost reductions sort of where you are now in the way that you're - what you've been able to achieve there? And then I guess back on the profitability in 2021 question, is there a level of revenue or a level of scale that is assumed in that math of -for the company that you'd be willing to share that's implied for that degree of profitability? NelsonChai: So, first of all, Heath, just to clarify the point in terms of the profitability we for the whole year on a fully incorporated basis are the statement. In terms of actually seeing some of the benefits actually incorporated into guidance and so as you know, we've improved our guidance for the full year and as we think about walking towards the 2021 target, obviously, that's included as we think about efficiency. Where you really see some of the benefits from it as just leverage, we're going to get over our corporate infrastructure. So the company has been building and the corporate overhead has been building to catch up to the growth of the company. And so you've seen as I mentioned 24% year-over-year and third quarter versus the third quarter of last year, you're going to start seeing those numbers starting to grow in much smaller digits and you're going to see the growth continue. And so you'll start getting some of that leverage. You heard Dara say insurance costs and costs like that continue to improve and payments cost and so will continue to grind it out, you've heard me talk about it. We don't think there's a big magic bullet. We're just continued to grind it out quarter-over-quarter. You won't see us take big charges on for insurance like others do and we're going to see it's included in our EBITDA and then we're going to just continue to focus on the execution there. And so it's not really a magic X Y or Z, it's a continuation of us executing the plan. You're seeing some of the semblance of it on the Rides business and some of the comments are in particular that Dara made in his prepared remarks. And then as Dara mentioned, we do see a path on the Eats side of the business down the road. DaraKhosrowshahi: And, Heath, just add a little bit more there. I think it's -this is almost across the board. We think that we can significantly improve cost of sales as a percentage of revenue. We think that we can improve our marketing spend and spend on incentives as a percentage of revenue as well, both in terms of the market rationalizing but our team's becoming much more effective in segmenting our consumer base and using targeted marketing in order to reach the right person at the right time. This company has been growing so fast over such a long period of time in so many countries that the teams really haven't been able to catch our breath and optimize. We now have team members going against every single P&L line item with specific projects et cetera to make sure that we can optimize and scale at the same time. We've done it with the Rides business already. There's more goodness to come we believe. And we believe we can kind of run the same play on Eats and the other businesses as well. So the teams are pretty focused. This stuff is not theoretical. There's execution ahead of us but we absolutely think we can pull this off. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. JustinPost: Great, thank you. So for MAPC season trips, a little bit blow some of the street estimates out there. Was there any divestiture in there? Or were there some pullback in some of your incentives? And maybe you feel better about the quality of your customers. Can you talk about that? And then you are guiding EBITDA $1.4 billion for above street numbers in 2021 which is loss of 1.4. What is that mean for your growth rates as we look out the next couple years? Are you going to have to give up some growth to get to those kinds of numbers? Thank you. DaraKhosrowshahi: Yes. I think as far as our trip growth goes, again keep things in perspective, a 31% trip grow 1.8 billion trips on a quarterly basis. These are very large numbers at significant scale. I think if I were to point some of the areas where we are making certain trade-offs as it relates to trip growth versus profitability, one would be our shared ride segment for example. We were losing significant sums in terms of our shared Rides really discounting and I think that the product and technology teams are much more focused on driving shared ride efficiency, building out new product like Express pool which we were way ahead of a competition that allows our consumers to essentially walk to a destination or wait. Products like Uber Extra Less that give you discount kind of lasting first-out et cetera. So the focus really is to drive lower rates based on the best technology out there versus just driving lower rates and grow through discounting. Building the tech is harder work but we think ultimately building the tech creates kind of deeper competitive advantages over the other players out there, and we think we simply have the best out there and we're certainly investing much more than any of the kind of local players can. In terms of 2021 targets, we will - these are our targets at this point and we haven't given formal guidance for 2021, but I will tell you that this will, we believe that we will be in a position to deliver very strong both top line and bottom line growth as a company at scale. There will always be trade-offs that we have to make but we're prepared to make those trade-offs and I think those kinds of tough trade-offs actually are positive for a culture of the company. So we want to be working on the very best ideas not just the average ideas. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. MarkMahaney: Okay, two questions please. Rationalization in the Rides business in different geographies, there's a lot of evidence that it's occurring in North America. To what extent you see that rationalization in other geographic markets? And then, Dara, could you talk about the synergies between Rides and Eats, the extent that the business model needs it to what extent you've already seen it? Any data points there would be helpful. Thank you. DaraKhosrowshahi: Sure, Mark. In terms of rationalization, I think it's a combination of both rationalization and just more effective execution on the teams. We are in almost every single market out there we have two, three, four, five competitors out there. They are pushing very hard but the fact is we've got the biggest network out there. We have the best brand. We have technology that we build on a global basis that we can roll out. And I think that our teams are executing better and I think that the network effects that you've talked about are showing themselves. I think that some competitors were able to kind of buy their way or spend their way which might have hidden some of the network effects of this model. When the spending goes out then you see how well teams can execute. And I think our teams are executing well. So we're seeing rationalization in the US, we see lots of competitor behavior all over the world. But we can execute in a competitive environment and I think that we are demonstrating that. As far as the synergies of the Rides in each business, you see it now and the app that we're testing with the Rides business, when you open up, we're testing - you open up the Rides app, you have the opportunity to order your food. We have run some promotional campaigns for example with certain of our partners McDonald's where McDonald's gets the cross promote their brand to our ride owners. The loyalty program that we have encompasses both Rides and Eats, 18 million members in less than a year of launch in the US as well. And we do believe that our customer acquisition costs and retention are superior to our competitors out there, which again is a benefit of the platform coming together. We think this will prove out over a period of time but we're seeing really good early signal. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. RossSandler: Hi, guys. Just one on Eats and then one on rides, if I can. So you had a comment about the 15% of Eats GB driving over half the EBITDA losses, it was pretty helpful. Can you guys talk about how far off the US business is from breakeven and I guess what does the barbell look like if you take like Australia on one end and India on the other end? How wider the goal posts in each business in terms of profitability? And then on rides, if you look at something like Brazil that's gone from profitable to negative and we know there was an acquisition from a competitor and a lot of investment behind that. But is something like that common that you're seeing across your other Rides markets? You mentioned the Top 5 and 17% to 62% I guess how sticky are those country level EBITDA margins over time? That'd be helpful. Thank you. NelsonChai: So in terms of the question on contribution margins, yes, there's the bar bell is pretty wide, right, between a place like in India and a place like in Australia. So, yes, you got that right. I think in some of them it's more -there are places inside the US which we would say is a place we're investing where we have positive EBITDA margin. And so it's a little bit more city by city and is just pure country by country. But yes, I think you have the bar bell about right. As you know, the each take rates in the top five cities in Q2 was kind of 8% to 16% and you see us continuing to make improvement there at least in Q3. And so there's no magic to it. It is a little bit based on the competitive situation and then we are taking the right actions as Dara said. And then we're very committed to really being one or two in all the markets and you're going to see us take action accordingly to get there or not. And so I think what we did in South Korea is also indicative. You want something on rides? DaraKhosrowshahi: Yes. I think on our Rides business, listen, there's - as I said lots of competition out there but we are profitable in essentially almost every single mega region out there that we operate in. And we are seeing, I would say more predictability around our Rides business although there are competitive flare ups in every single market for example, we've seen competition enter in London, but and I think the teams are just executing better. If you went kind of back two or three years back, there were certain markets where we were the only competitor out there. I don't think there are any markets like that, so just competition is a way of life and the teams adjust and I think our teams are just executing much better than they were in what is a new tough environment. But I like where our margins are headed in that environment and by Nelson's remarks, when you've got markets that are today 60 plus percent in terms of adjusted EBITDA that gives you kind of a roadmap as to where we think we can take certainly not every single country or every single mega region. It just shows you that there's plenty of margin upside left in the business even with competition out there. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Youssef Squali with SunTrust. YoussefSquali: Great. Thank you. Two questions here please. Not to be the dead horse here on Eats, but that profitability in 2021, the way you are defining it requires profitability or at least a breakeven in the Eats business by that date or does it just basically assume somewhat of an improving environment? And then second, can you talk maybe about your experience in New York City and may be growth there, post the hikes that we've been seeing over the last call it six months or so. Just perhaps as a proxy of what may happen, if and when AB5 went to go through? Thank you. NelsonChai: So again we don't want to get too stuck on 2021 as Dara said, we're still in the process of working through it. What I would tell you it does not predicate that Eats has to be either profitable or breakeven on the EBITDA margin basis. The commentary we made was on a consolidated basis for all of Uber. And that is really what the target is. And so I don't want to get too detailed in terms of each of the lines, but it is not necessarily predicate that Eats has to be profitable or breakeven in 2021. DaraKhosrowshahi: And, yes, I think as far as our New York City growth, we have seen significant price increases in New York City to the consumer out there. But the business is certainly growing from a booking standpoint. Those price increases are slowing down trip growth for, if you look at the last six months trip growth is still up on a year-over-year basis in New York for the six month period. We are definitely seeing the increased prices affect neighborhoods that might be in transit deserts that are more prices sensitive and we don't think that's a good thing for New York. And it's certainly not a good thing for those neighborhoods. But that the New York call it, example shows a business that continues to grow and it's quite resilient to the environment around it. Ultimately, there's a lot of demand for transportation and we're becoming kind of a more fundamental part of everyone's lives. And then our adding in other services such as Metro just kind of creates more occasions for people to come onto the app, whether they want to take an Uber or whether they want to take a pool or whether in many cases they want to take public transit. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Masha Kahn with HSBC. MashaKahn: Hi, thanks for the opportunity to ask question. I noticed you launched Uber Money. Can you talk a little bit about your vision Uber Money, let's say five years from now? What is it going to look like? Are you planning to go into merchant acquiring? And second question can you comment on how much of a drag India was on your ANR this quarter? Thank you. NelsonChai: So I'll take first question - the second question first and so I have talked about on the Eats side of the business the type of drag and so the Eats ANR was 10.7% in Q3. So it was about a 0.4 drag in terms of the numbers. So India wasn't in there, it would have been posted 11.1%. Regarding where we are on Money, we had a Peter Hazlehurst, who's leading the Money team for us had a presentation in Las Vegas. And what we really are focused on right now is really enhancing the opportunity for drivers on our platform and what I would say is that as you think about with what consistency that is, making sure that they can get paid quickly matters a lot. And so for many of the drivers and so for many people who work in the workplace you know you're getting paid every other week. And that's probably okay. For many of our drivers, it's, how can we get them paid quicker. And so a lot of the initiatives we're talking about right now are really helping them through that process, many of our drivers are unbanked and so by creating the Uber wallet and allowing them to have the opportunity to have an Uber debit card. And we're working on tools that allows them to get paid every day or after every trip. We have other tools that provides them a little bit of opportunity to the extent they need $50 for gas, so they can go drive and so we're creating tools like that really around enhancing and helping our driver partners. Beyond that, we obviously are doing a lot in terms of what we can do with business - from a business development side in terms of lowering our payments cost. And we are exploring different opportunities as you know, but it's too early for me to comment beyond really trying to create and really build out a great product for our drivers. And if you think about the amount of funds that flows through our system, we think there's a big opportunity there and we think there's a good opportunity to really help them in terms of giving them the cash and they need it which is immediately and then give them purchasing power and then also help them save on things whether it be gas or service or other thing insurance and other things that we can help leverage our buying power. So that's kind of where we are today. We obviously are looking beyond it. It would be premature for me to comment beyond that. DaraKhosrowshahi: Yes. I think we're the first company to stream real time earnings at the kind of scale that we are which is pretty exciting as Nelson said. Operator : Next question is from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead. ItayMichaeli: Great, thank you everyone. Just two financial questions for me. First, Nelson, hoping you can walk us a bit more into the sequential Q4 EBITDA loss. It seems like your ANR will accelerate from Q3 per your guidance. Maybe just walk us through that the widening loss expectation for Q4. And then secondly, any change to kind of long term I think 25% adjusted EBITDA margin target for the business as a whole? NelsonChai: So we haven't changed any of the long-term targets. And as Dara mentioned earlier, we will comment more specifically in the Q4 call we think about 2020 guidance. As you think about Q4, yes, it does assume a little bit of an uptick versus where you finished in Q3. There is going to be some more investment probably on the Eats side of the business given the marketplace and then additionally we are investing in other things and you might just see kind of the full-year effect of some of the adds that we've made through the course of the year. And so those really are kind of work what it characterizes. There are parts of our business that does have some seasonal changes. And so that increases cost. So typically driver and courier cost in Q4 can go up as well. And so that's all kind of embedded inside of a kind of what you're implying for Q4. DaraKhosrowshahi: So I think year-on-year is going to be pretty attractive but quarter-on-quarter you might see some seasonal effects but the year-on-year that we see in Q4 is going to be pretty strong. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. LloydWalmsley: Thank. Two questions, if I can. First can you talk a little bit more about the progress in some of the newer markets? Dara, I think you called out Germany, Japan and Argentina in your prepared remarks, but if you can give us a better sense of what products are driving that strength. And then maybe any other markets where you see things are opening up over the next year or so? And then second one, Dara, you've been focused on reducing kind of parts of the company to make it more nimble. Wondering just how much left there is to do there and how you feel the organization's responding in terms of becoming a little bit more efficient? Thanks. DaraKhosrowshahi: Sure, absolutely. So Germany is - just talking about Germany, Japan, Argentina, we're very optimistic on Germany. The growth rates there are very significant, year-on-year growth rates over a 100% in Germany on the Rides side of the business. We've also introduced JUMP bikes in Germany as well and Europe to some extent is kind of the center of the micro mobility revolution that we're seeing. And we're seeing incredible response to JUMP both in Germany and on balance in many European cities as well. And we've got a government working group on ride sharing reform which is in progress. And, listen, we think we're a more efficient environmentally friendly way to move in Germany. There are some for example laws that don't allow us to pool in Germany which really make no sense. And we're confident that with constructive dialogue and a continued investment in engaging with lawmakers in Germany, we can get to a win for Germany; we can get to a win for customers and which will also lead eventually to a win for Uber as well. For us Japan is a very promising market. It's kind of a taxi first market. I say the lead in Japan is actually Uber Eats product. Our category position in Uber Eats continue seeing improves significantly year-on-year. We are definitely leaning into the Japanese market as it relates to Eats. And we think Japan can be one of the very strong markets out there and certainly a market where we have the potential to get to that number position and a big kind of number one strategic number-one for us. We're diligently working in Japan as it relates to the Rides business growth is over 60% on year-on-year basis and we just launched Fukuoka for our tenth taxi market in Japan as well. It will take time; Japan always takes time but we're doing it the right way with the right relationships and Japan on the right side. Argentina for us is one of our fastest-growing markets, although I will tell you that with the change in government et cetera, we are being measured in our expectations. We want to make sure that we engage with the new policymakers and continue kind of the right dialogue which is how do we make sure that we are providing a service that is a benefit for the cities in which we operate, benefit for riders and drivers alike and most importantly safe for all parties involved. So Argentina has to date been quite positive and will be working kind of with new government out there to make sure that we are considered kind of a good actor or positive actor out there. As you know, in the UK, we continue to have dialogue with TFL, working closely with them and again when I look at the regulatory framework on a global basis, we always have ups or downs but the teams are making investments. And I think more and more cities and countries around the world are coming to the conclusion that Uber is a good thing for their country and Uber is a good thing for their City as well. As far as making connoisseur moves in terms of how we work. Listen, we're just - it's - this company grew very fast and in the early years the kind of the most important factor was speed to market, who got there earliest and who scaled the fastest. And so there wasn't a lot of focus on how do you make sure that you work efficiently? How do you make sure that the teams are working together? How do you make sure that you reduce duplicate work that might not be adding value? It was absolutely the right set of priorities for the time. Our priorities are changing. And now we can deliver scale growth which is technology enabled and leading to profits in 2021 on an EBITDA basis. That's a focus of the company and I think that requires more coordination and that absolutely will allow us to automate some tasks that were done manually. And also get rid of duplication that was an adding value. And we think that we've got kind of a roadmap ahead of us, and we're pretty confident that we can execute both top line and bottom line as a result. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Justin Patterson with Raymond James. JustinPatterson: Great. Thanks. On Uber rewards $20 million is a solid start. I know it's early but could you talk about how these users are different from non loyalty members with respect to engagement? And how important is it that you - towards the profitability targets that you create more monogamous users with loyalty being one of the factors to get there? Thanks. DaraKhosrowshahi: Hi, Justin. We are seeing early signs from the loyalty members in terms of higher engagement, higher use of our products, higher cross platform utilization as well. I will caution, it is very early. We have just launched and there's a ton of optimization ahead of us in terms of the loyalty program, how do we optimize the customer experience, how do we make sure that we remind our users when they are able to -when they get a benefit. I think there's a lot more that we can do there. And then how do we encourage users to cross-pollinate between one of our services to another service out there. So we think there's a long road ahead of us and we're very, very early here. In terms of our forecast going forward, we think that building, increasing customer engagement, deepening loyalty and being more efficient in terms of customer acquisition cost and segmentations, absolutely are parts of the path to profitability. But the teams have a plan that they're executing to and we're confident that we can get goodness there. Do we have time for one more question? NelsonChai: Last question, yes. Operator : And your last question will come from the line of Brad Erickson with Needham & Company. BradErickson: Hi, thanks. Just to follow up on the Eats business. I guess related to that comment earlier the 15% of Eats booking is doing, I guess half the losses. Does any of those markets in those 15% bookings fall into situations where you're not the number one or two positions? So just wondering if there's a chance that you exit some of these at some point as you said. And I guess just more broadly in cases where you're not a one or a two player or can't get there in 12 to 18 months, disposing is the only option you've mentioned so far in the call, but maybe talk how proactively you might use M&A to try and improve your position in those certain markets? Thanks. NelsonChai: Yes. There are some markets where we're not one or two that are in there right now. Yes, we are going to look at both disposing as well as using M&A as potential levers. We are going to lean in and we're doing a lot of work right now from an allocation perspective across all our businesses. And so the teams are working pretty hard in terms of creating these maps. And we think about resource allocation and so we are going to work through it. We are - it is going to take 12 to 18 months like you said. We are going to look at all the different levers we have. Our commitment is to lean in if we think we can win or be one or two. And if we think we can't we're going to be good stewards of capital. And so we will make the appropriate choices. We've been working pretty hard in terms of that framework and the teams are working hard on it right now. And so yes, our goal is to execute against those plans. DaraKhosrowshahi: Let's do one more question, operator. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Please go ahead. JohnBlackledge: Great. Thanks. Just two questions. On AB5 just curious is there any - do you expect any impact in 2020? I know the ballot measure is in November. Just curious about that and just longer-term implications. And then second question just the rationale and potential for grocery delivery with the recent Cornershop deal. Thank you. DaraKhosrowshahi: Sure, listen, on AB5, we've been living under this law for 1.5 years in California since the dynamic decision and we've always existed with 85 like ABC tests in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Connecticut. These are pretty big markets for us and we know states like New York and Washington. They've already suggested that they want to pursue gig worker protections and we're happy to work with them on solutions that look similar to the ballot measure that we filed. This has protections, representation pay standards as well. We're not afraid of these conversations and at the same time, we're not afraid to defend our model, if those conversations turn out to be unsuccessful. And I'm hoping that the US politicians would be willing to work with our industry, our partners to get to progressive new models that are win-win that frankly they're already being established in Europe. But if not, we'll continue to aggressively defend our drivers' rights to flexibility. It's always the number one reason why our drivers value our platform. The vast majority of our drivers are not full-time drivers. And we think that not only do they value that flexibility, but we should actively make sure that we defend that flexibility. And we would look to provide private benefits where we can to improve their lives as well. So this is going to take dialogue. We're up for that dialogue and one way or the other we think that our model will thrive and grow. As far as Cornershop goes, we think that grocery is a very high frequency use case. It has significantly high basket sizes. We were very impressed with a Cornershop team and as you can expect we meet with everybody in our industry and in adjacent categories as well. And we were just super impressed with this team that has been able to build out a great product with actually pretty limited capital out there. So what we - the opportunity that we see is you have a product that has been highly optimized over a long period of time. And we get to put that product through our sales channel so to speak. We get to expose it to our customers and we've seen it. When we expose our Eats product to our Rides customers, good things happen. When we expose Transit to our Rides customers good things happen. We see the same thing with grocery. We think with Cornershop we will start in Latin America to make sure that it's working. That's - we obviously have a very big position in Latin America. And we will expose Cornershop grocery as well as other products to our Eats customers and our Rides customers in Latin America. If it works there and we're pretty darn confident that it will. We'll look to extend it but first it'll be within the LATAM markets where Cornershop has a ton of experience. And this is just about putting a great product against a huge audience that is already engaged with all the payments, all the identity, all of that stuff taken care of. So taking out a ton of friction that a bunch of our competitors have to deal with. So we're pretty excited. It's a great team and we're really looking forward to welcoming them to the Uber family. So with that thank you everyone for joining us for the call. I think Q3 was another strong example of the Uber team executing. We're excited about the 2021 consolidated EBITDA profitability target that we have out there. And we hope that we've shown you that we can execute against not just delivering top-line growth, but also top-line growth with discipline. We could only do so with the really, really hard work of all of our employees on a global basis. And also the partnership of the cities that we work with. And our drivers et cetera. None of this would be possible without them. But we think we're on a good path. And we thank you for your interest in this call. And we'll hopefully have more to talk to you down the road. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there\u2019ll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Emily Reuter, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Emily Reuter : Thank you, operator.

Following prepared remarks today, we will open the call to questions. For the remainder of the discussion, all growth rates reflect the year-over-year growth unless otherwise noted. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Emily. And thank you all for joining us today. 2019 was a major milestone year for Uber. We achieved $65 billion in gross bookings, up 35%. We crossed the $100 million mark for MAPCs reaching $111 million in the fourth quarter and we increased the number of consumers using both Rides and Eats by 68%. We grew adjusted net revenue 28% to $13 billion with growth accelerating from 18% in Q1, 43% in Q4. We improved totally quarterly adjusted EBITDA by over $200 million year-over-year or by 14 percentage points as a percentage of adjusted net revenue. In 2020, we expect to see adjusted EBITDA losses to continue to decline. To me, these results are a validation of strategy we set in 2019. We will continue to relentlessly execute our plans for each of our businesses in 2020. In Rides, we generated $742 million in Rides adjusted EBITDA on the fourth quarter covering our corporate overhead by $98 million. We exited 2019 at a $3 billion run rate for Rides adjusted EBITDA with ANR growth continuing to accelerate in Q4. We [grew] [ph] gross bookings in our high priority markets, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Spain by four times the rate of overall Rides GB growth. We expanded in our set of products serving high value consumers and use cases including the launch of Uber Comfort which drove premium Rides growth of 55% in Q4 and Uber for Business which achieved $1.2 billion in gross bookings in Q4. We also continue pursuing low cost products such as two and three wheelers and are using our superior matching capabilities and data models to drive more efficient Shared Rides products. In Eats, we steadily delivered on a strategy to be number one or number two in every market by leaning into our investment in some countries and exiting others. We grew gross bookings by over 70% and are now in first or second position in well over half of our countries reflecting the significant majority of our gross bookings including the U.S., UK, France, Mexico and Japan. The divestiture of our Eats business in India and our exit from East and South Korea are recent examples of our strategic discipline. We also saw promising results in the U.S., our largest Eats market. We grew our U.S. Eats business 44% to $1.7 billion in GBs and maintain a strong number two position. At the same time, we increased our U.S. take rate 500 basis points year-over-year to the mid teens despite a competitive environment. In 2020, we\u2019ll continue to follow the Rides playbook, focusing on turning the dial towards healthy growth, market leadership and margin expansion significantly curtailing losses throughout the year with Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 reflecting peak investment for our Eats business. In our Freight and Other Bets segments, we\u2019re focused on responsible expansion with a heavy focus on unit economics. We\u2019ll continue to be thoughtful and disciplined in allocating capital by weighing growth, ROI, and the impact on total company profitability to determine the appropriate investment in each of these segments. In our Advanced Technologies Group, having completed $1 billion in funding, we expand in mapping and data collection efforts with five cities and continued to make progress towards an autonomous future with plans to expand our on road testing of cars and autonomous mode with a vehicle operator present in select cities. Just this week we issued \u2013 we were issued a permit which gives us the ability to resume testing in California. In 2020, we\u2019ll continue to drive our roadmap for ATG through the hard work of our dedicated employees, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Denver, and Toronto, alongside the support from our investors and partners such as Toyota and DENSO. I also want to touch on the regulatory environment. We\u2019re a boots on the ground business with a physical presence in every market in which we operate. Regulation has been and always will be a constant for us. And while our dialogue with regulators is ongoing as it should be, we have by and large moved away from the question of whether ride-sharing should exist to more nuanced questions around taxes, fees and driver status. We\u2019ve achieved significant wins this year, including a successful lawsuit against the cruising cap in New York, expansion into several additional states in Mexico, movement on reform in Korea, continued growth in Japan and Germany and just yesterday a positive ruling on employment classification from Brazil\u2019s highest labor corp. We firmly believe we share many of the same goals of the cities in which we operate. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll continue to work in a positive collaborative manner, while at the same time defending the interests of drivers, riders and others who rely on the Uber platform. Lastly, we believe that a more disciplined capital environment will be favorable for our business going forward, but we aren\u2019t just sitting here hoping for a better environment. We\u2019re making proactive changes to achieve significant cost leverage for both Rides and Eats through a focused operating playbook including improved machine learning algos and further automation and targeting of our incentive and online marketing spend, stronger tracking and focus for our offline marketing campaigns. The reduction of defect rates and improved self-service tools to improve customer sentiment as well as contact ratios, continued improvement in payment costs, improved matching, rounding pricing algos to increase our marketplace efficiency, allowing our drivers to earn more per active hour and tech enabled automation as well as good old-fashioned cost control to leverage our operational cost structure across the board. With many of the onetime changes from 2019 behind us, we\u2019re excited to sharpen our focus on execution to grow our business at massive scale, innovate faster than anyone else, improve margins considerably, allocate our capital effectively and efficiently and do the right thing for all of our constituencies, ultimately driving to excellent revenue growth and profitability. Our progress in 2019 and our 2020 plans gives me the confidence to challenge our teams to accelerate our EBITDA profitability target from full year 2021 to Q4 2020. It\u2019s important to emphasize that we plan to achieve this profitably target assuming only modest improvements in the current competitive environment and without the assumption of any significant changes to our current portfolio businesses. Further, long-term, we remain confident about achieving our overall company adjusted EBITDA margin of 25%. Specifically, we expect Rides to deliver adjusted EBITDA margin of 45% with a 25% take rate and our Eats business to deliver adjusted EBITDA margin of 30% with a 15% take rate. Now to Nelson for more details on the numbers. Nelson Chai : Thanks, Dara. Now on to our GAAP results for Q4 2019. Our GAAP revenue of $4.1 billion, was up 37%. GAAP costs of revenues excluding D&A of $1.9 billion decreased to 47% from 54% of revenues in Q4 2018. GAAP EPS is a loss of $0.64 and compares to a loss of a $1.97 in Q4 of 2018. For the remainder of the call unless otherwise noted, I will discuss key operational metrics as well as non-GAAP financial measures excluding pro forma adjustments such as stock-based compensation. Our total company global trips of $1.9 billion, grew 28%. Global trips are driven primarily by growth in Eats and International Rides, particularly in Latin America. Monthly active platform consumers were 111 million, up 22% year-over-year or 8% quarter-over-quarter. Our rewards program reached over 25 million members across the U.S., Latin America, and Australia. Total company gross bookings of $18.1 billion growing 28% or 30% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted net revenue or ANR was $3.7 billion, up 43% on a constant currency basis. Our ANR take rate was 20.6% of gross bookings, up 190 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP cost of revenue excluding D&A decreased 43% from 50% of ANR. Insurance and payments as a percentage of ANR improved quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Turning now to non-GAAP operating expense. Operations and support decreased year-over-year to 13% from 15% of adjusted net revenue reflecting continued Rides support efficiency improvements offset by a mix shift to Eats transactions which are seeking to automate further. Sales and marketing decreased to 33% from 35% of adjusted net revenue versus Q4 of 2018. This decrease is primarily due to optimization and performance marketing spend partially offset by an increase in promotion spent primarily related to Uber Eats. R&D decreased to 13% from 14% of ANR in Q4 2018 and G&A decrease from 15% from 18% of ANR versus the year ago quarter. Quarter-over-quarter, our spend increased slightly due to elevate professional services spend we expect to gain leverage across 2020. Our Q4 2019 total company adjusted EBITDA loss was $615 million. Q4 and Q1 as I\u2019d mentioned on earlier calls reflect the peak of our investment in Eats and we expect total company adjusted EBITDA loss to shrink starting in Q2. Now, I\u2019ll provide additional detail on our segments. First on Rides. Rides gross bookings of $13.5 billion, grew 20% on a constant currency basis, led by the U.S. and Latin America. Rides ANR of $3 billion, grew 32% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued favorable market dynamics in U.S., stability in Latin America since the beginning of 2019 and increased focused on Shared Rides efficiency. Rides adjusted EBITDA was $742 million or 24.4% of Rides ANR. This represented a quarterly record on an absolute dollars and margin basis with a 240 basis point improvement quarter-over-quarter as a percentage of ANR. Eats gross bookings of $4.4 billion, grew 73% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued trip growth in both the U.S. and international markets combined with higher average gross bookings per trip. We maintained a strong number two position in the U.S. for the third straight quarter, only four years from our market entry with Eats gross bookings in the U.S. of $1.7 billion growing 44% year-over-year. Eats ANR was $415 million, up 154% on a constant currency basis to the pricing changes in the U.S. coupled with benefits from lower courier costs in the second half of the year. Excluding Eats India, which we divested to Zomato in January of this year, Eats take rate was 10.1% for the quarter. Eats adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $461 million or negative 111% of ANR, excluding Eats India, Eats adjusted EBITDA would have been a loss of $418 million. Eats take rate declined sequentially consistent with our outlook driven by seasonal costs increases as well as our investments in competitive markets to strengthen and grow our leading position. On Freight, we grew ANR of over 75% and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $55 million. Freight growth was driven by volume growth of 89% offsetting lower pricing for market tightening. Our Freight business continued to expand its offerings to carriers including in-app bundles, which allowed carriers to book multiple loads at once, thereby reducing empty miles versus non-Uber Freight matched bundles. Our Other Bets segment had ANR of $35 million and then adjusted EBITDA loss of $67 million. Q4 represents a seasonal trial for bikes and scooter business due to weather. We continue to focus on building a sustainable and scalable business that serves as an important acquisition and engagement channel for our core transportation consumers. JUMP one permits to expand in key markets such as Washington, D.C. and four markets across Australia and New Zealand. Our permit win in D.C. will make us the largest combined dockless fleet operator in the city across bikes and scooters. ATG adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $130 million and in Q4 2019, the corporate G&A and Platform R&D of $644 million, which represents the G&A and R&D not allocated to one of our five segments increased 13%. In terms of liquidity, we ended the quarter with approximately $11.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents in short-term investments. Across a number of our businesses, we use M&A as an important strategic tool and most notably with our acquisition to Careem. We also announced the acquisition of a majority stake in corner shop to bring grocery delivery to millions of consumers on the Uber Platform beginning in Latin America. This transaction is expected to close in Q2 2020 subject to regulatory approval. We will continue to explore ways in which M&A can accelerate or de-risk our path to profitability. Now, I\u2019ll wrap up by providing guidance and some relative context. We remain committed to delivering profitable growth for all of our stakeholders, both investing for long-term growth and expansion while ensuring discipline with our capital allocation strategy. In the second half of 2019, we began the process of streamlining our footprint with a single minded focus on profitable global leadership in our core businesses. Most notably, we rationalized our Shared Rides product and in Eats we exited two significant markets with elevated losses. While we\u2019ve already started demonstrating strong profitability improvements, we view 2020 as a truly transformational year beyond which we believe we will emerge with stabilizing bookings and revenue growth, continued focus on leveraging our cost base and positive EBITDA. Importantly, as we continue to eliminate bookings that are essentially empty calories in 2020, we expect to expand take rates and EBITDA margins resulting in slightly lower gross bookings growth. With that context in mind, we expect 2020 reported gross bookings of $75 billion to $80 billion reflecting constant currency growth of 17% to 25% and reported growth of 15% to 23% with an FX headwind of roughly 150 basis points. This outlook includes the modest positive impact from our acquisition of Careem and modest negative impact from our Eats divestiture in India. Further, while Q1 is typically our slowest sequential quarter growth, we expect gross bookings to modestly decline sequentially in Q1 2020, primarily driven by year-over-year declines in the Shared Rides product and the divestiture mentioned earlier. Starting in 2020, in the spirit of further improving transparency, we will be providing ANR outlook as well. We believe this disclosure should allow investors visibility into the top line metric that our business leaders are measured against internally. We expect adjusted net revenue of $16 billion to $17 billion in 2020, reflecting constant currency growth of 26% to 34% and reported growth of 24% to 32% Our ANR outlook implies a take rate improvement of roughly 150 basis points year-on-year. We expect Q1 take rates to be relatively in line with a Q4 take rate consistent with our normal seasonal trends. For 2020 adjusted EBITDA, we expect a loss of $1.45 billion to $1.25 billion. Further, we expect Q1 EBITDA loss to be similar to Q4 2019 levels with similar investment levels in Eats. Beyond Q1, we are expecting a meaningful improvement in profitability throughout the year including in Uber Eats. As Dara stated, based on our visibility into 2020 trends, we are pulling forward our profitability expectations and now plan to end 2020 with Q4 marking our first EBITDA positive quarter. We recognize the significant work remaining to get to this milestone and our teams are focused on executing our plan. Finally, we expect stock-based compensation of $300 million to $350 million in Q1 and we expect our Q1 2020 basic and diluted weighted average share count to be $1.725 billion to $1.75 billion. And now with that, we\u2019re happy to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Heath Terry from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Heath Terry : Great, thanks. Dara, when you look at the things that are driving demand in particularly in the Rides business in the U.S. and globally, anything in particular that you would point to, you\u2019ve obviously been able to improve profitability in that business significantly. What\u2019s allowing you to keep demand at these levels even as you bring profitability \u2013 even as you bring profitability, we know pricing\u2019s obviously been a lever there. Have you been surprised by the level of inelasticity of demand and is there anything else besides that that you would point to? Dara Khosrowshahi : Heath, I think the most important factor that I point to is that we\u2019re moving from a society that was dependent on transportation based on owned assets to a society that is going to depend on transportation as a service based on shared assets. So there\u2019s a very, very consistent tailwind that we have in the U.S. and across the world and that tailwind is going to serve us well and continues to serve as well going forward. And I think people are changing the way that they live, that they\u2019re changing certainly the way that they get around and especially the younger generation is not a generation that associates car ownership with freedom. They associate non-car ownership with freedom using our services. In addition to that, we continue to execute on the base business. We do think that we\u2019ve got some pricing power and we are putting that pricing power in a careful way into the markets. We\u2019re investing pretty aggressively in our premium product. When you look at comfort and the launch across the world, when you look at our enterprise business both in terms of U for B and Uber for health, they\u2019re growing at very, very attractive rates. There are in a number of countries that I mentioned are growth countries, Argentina, Germany, Japan, Spain, et cetera where we think the regulatory framework which hasn\u2019t been constructive in the past can be constructive in the past and we\u2019re kind of growing in those businesses in the right way in those countries, in the right way so to speak. We think two and three wheelers are very, very big opportunities for us going forward, especially in emerging markets. And we think that once we rebase our Shared Rides segments, reprice it I think our Shared Rides business will continue to grow because we\u2019re growing based on improving the efficacy of the matching algorithms versus just growing through pricing. So you put it all together and we\u2019re confident that the Rides business, it will continue to be a strong top line growth company. And our ability to drive margins, which you\u2019ve seen in 2019 is certainly going to continue in 2020 as well. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. I have two just, the first one on the full year bookings guide, the $75 billion to $80 billion is really helpful. Just talk us through how you think about the growth of the Rides bookings within that guidance. And I know there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces in the Rides bookings between pooling in LATAM and everything else. So just sort of talk us through some of the puts and takes in Rides bookings that we should make sure we consider and how you\u2019re thinking about that growth this year. And then on Eats, Dara, it sounds like a very healthy improvement in take rates as well as growth in the U.S. So talk to us, how you think about the keys to continuing to grow at this type of rate in the U.S. on the Eats side, is it more supply, is it discounting? What are the growth strategies in the U.S. Eats business? Dara Khosrowshahi : I\u2019ll start with the U.S. Eats and then Nelson can get into the Rides guide, so to speak, or the GB guide. I think the most important factor as it relates to the growth of the U.S. business, has really been about selection. We have been very focused on improving the selection and the number of restaurants that we have in our Eats segments. If you look overall, we improved. We\u2019ve got almost 400,000 active restaurants. This is up 78% on a year-on-year basis. And we\u2019ve added independence and we\u2019ve added a number of big chains and big names as well. And I think that the improvement in selection combined with our technology over the top technology that allows us to essentially list restaurants whether we have a direct relationship with them or not is allowing us to improve kind of our addressable footprint. And that combined with, again, the tailwind of more and more people wanting the convenience of getting delivery in their home, I think has combined to have a pretty strong top line and a pretty solid number two position in the U.S. So we like what we see. I think that at some point the growth rates you get to the law of large numbers, but I think that the Eats team executed well in Q4. Q1, we\u2019re going to continue to lean in. And then really the back half of 2020 is one where we want to combine growth, but also improve margins with the Eats business. Nelson Chai : Yes. In terms of the Rides growth, I mean, you\u2019ve heard us talk before. I mean by definition, the law of large numbers does take hold. And as you know, our business does over a $1 billion a week in terms of gross bookings. So I think you can tell in the guidance, we are trying \u2013 we recognize the fact that we\u2019re not doing the empty calories. And I think you\u2019ve heard that both in Dara\u2019s comments as well as mine. But we recognize the fact that we\u2019re going to really be focused on having profitability today. In past calls, we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we\u2019ve deemphasized Shared Rides and that is positive as well. We do actually look at our trip growth as well as our gross bookings growth. And so while the gross bookings growth based on the guidance we gave you, it\u2019s suggested as below 20% the trip growth is still above it. And so we continue to look at both. But again, we\u2019re really focused on optimizing the system right now. And if anything we probably because we are trying to take the empty calories out, we are definitely much focused on that and so I think that is reflective in the overall guidance that we\u2019re giving. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks. Nelson Chai : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Justin Post, your line is open. Dara Khosrowshahi : Justin, are you there? Justin Post : Sorry about that. Sorry about that, I was on mute. Yes. Dara, a couple of questions for you. Pretty optimistic long-term margin targets in take rates. What are you seeing in your business that gives you confidence in those long-term margins? Is it specific markets you\u2019re seeing or is it the broad improvement you\u2019ve seen over the last six months? And then secondly, getting to EBITDA profitability in Q4 certainly higher than the Street numbers, do you worry at all that that kind of boxes you in and limits your flexibility? And is there any cushion in there if there\u2019s some adverse regulatory stuff? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I think talking about these \u2013 that the margin numbers in Q4, the assumption as it relates to Q4 and profitability is that the environment doesn\u2019t change significantly one way or the other. So there may be short-term bumps one way or the other and we will deal with them. We are assuming a world that doesn\u2019t change significantly and we\u2019re challenging the team internally to get to profitability. And we think that just as we challenged the team internally, we\u2019re going to communicate it to our investors and my take is we expect to execute and it\u2019s not a single lever that\u2019s going to get us there. It\u2019s multiple levers. And is it boxing us in, it\u2019s a boxing us into execute effectively as a team. And I\u2019ll take on that challenge and I think we will take on that challenge. Just to give you a little bit of context as to our ability to execute. If you look at our Rides business Q4 to Q4, our Rides business grew ANR about $700 million, a little bit below $700 million in terms of revenue. And over the same period with a $700 million increase in ANR, they delivered a $550 million increase in EBITDA. So that\u2019s an 80% flow through of incremental EBITDA from revenue growth to EBITDA growth. In order for us to hit Q4, if you look at for example, of the mid range of our revenue growth, let\u2019s say it\u2019s the mid range of our revenue growth. You would have about a $1 billion to $1.1 billion of additional revenue Q4 next year to versus Q4 this year. And in order to get to break even, you need to drop about 55% of that incremental ANR to the bottom line. So we\u2019ve executed on the Rides side 80%. Our expectation is going forward, we\u2019re going to continue to lean forward and we will invest in big time growth areas of the business. But we do think that this is a team that has shown its capability to drop 80% of the bottom line. And I think that our pushing ourselves to drop 55% of the bottom line is not asking for too much and it does provide us flexibility to invest where appropriate to really work the operating costs appropriately and then pull backward just doesn\u2019t make sense to invest. Justin Post : Got it. Thank you. And then on the long-term, are there some markets that really give you confidence in those long-term take rates and margin targets? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I think on the margin targets long-term, the Rides business we have \u2013 you\u2019ve seen the Rides business essentially move in the right direction. So we\u2019re pretty confident of the Rides long-term margins. When I look at Eats for example, our U.S. business, the take rates are not quite up to our 15% take rate, but they\u2019re certainly getting much closer. And when we look at kind of the operating costs work that we\u2019ve done on the Rides business, if we run the same play that we do in Eats, we\u2019re confident that we can hit those kinds of long-term margins. Justin Post : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is open. Ross Sandler : Hey guys. Just one on Rides and one on Eats. So you mentioned that single rider trip volume was three points higher than total, would imply that you\u2019ve already chopped a lot of wood on UberPool in 2019. So all these low calories that you are talking about taking out in 2020 is that more share ride that you sell? Is it single ride or coupon? Any color on what\u2019s incremental for 2020 versus what we saw in 2019 already? And then on Eats just a question how level like the Australian market is very profitable for you guys. Is that because of the density, because of something unique in terms of the fee structure, or simply because it\u2019s far less competitive? And how can the U.S. ever look like that without consolidation? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Hey Ross, as far as the Ride segment and shared rides, et cetera, I\u2019d say we started chopping real wood in shared rides in Q3, Q4. So we will continue to have tougher comps on a trips basis with shared rides in Q1, Q2. And then Q3 and Q4 you\u2019re going to get to comps that reflect the kind of long-term growth rates that we expect there. I think in Australia, as far as the business goes there, it\u2019s just a really good market for us, the market \u2013 it looks like a Western market as far as the structures go, payment structures, et cetera. And I think we just have a team on the ground that\u2019s executed really well. And when a team on ground executes really well, you get really great top lines and very, very healthy margin levels. Nelson Chai : And the only thing I\u2019ll add is we do have some cities even here in the U.S. where we have a profile that resembles what you\u2019re suggesting in Australia. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. And then remember too, that Australia, we do have three competitors. So you should assume that basically every market that we compete, that we are operating in, we have anywhere from two to four competitors. It\u2019s the nature of this market. These are very, very large TAMs to go after. And we don\u2019t believe that there\u2019ll be a single winner, take it all. But we believe that we\u2019re in a we\u2019re in a unique position because of our global scale, and because we\u2019re number one in most of the markets that we operate in and because we\u2019re multi-product to have a structural margin advantage, which we can either take to the bottom line or deliver a better service with, or drive kind of stronger revenue margins than our competition. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you. Two things. One Dara, could you talk a little bit about synergies that you\u2019ve seen between Rides and Eats and potential synergies you think you can generate between those two. And then secondly, spend a little time just talking about some of the products that you\u2019ve rolled out. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any read-throughs yet from some of the driver changes that you\u2019ve made in California. And I don\u2019t mean in terms of complying with regulations or whatever. I mean, in terms of whether drivers are more interested in driving with Uber because of those changes. And likewise on the rider side, some of the product changes, some of the loyalty programs, what have you seen that indicated which ones, which of these product changes have worked well from a rider perspective and which haven\u2019t worked well? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, absolutely. So in terms of the synergy goal, I\u2019d say there\u2019s no single magical win, it\u2019s a combination of a number of factors that we\u2019re putting together. So one is cross promoting our services together. We now have subscription programs that are Rides only, Eats only in Uber as well. We have a loyalty program that goes across the various products as well. All of those coming together are significantly increasing the number of consumers who use both of our services. And whereas early on if a rider was using two of our services the number of transactions per month was about 2x was a single user, now that number is closer to 3x. So the returns on higher usage of our products are actually going from a 2x to 3x, which for us is very, very encouraging. The number of loyalty program members that we have is 25 million and growing because we\u2019re expanding that program on a global basis. And then I would never underestimate two very important factors. One is the power of Uber brands. Everyone knows that. You probably already have an account with us. You probably have a credit card with us, et cetera. It\u2019s very, very easy to sign up. I think riders and drivers trust us across the world. And then the leverage that we\u2019re getting on our technology spend, we can spend more than anyone else in terms of driving innovation, in terms of big data, having the most sophisticated matching and pricing algorithms out there. And at the same time, I think, your technology spend as a percentage of revenue and our G&A and our overhead costs as a percentage of revenue can be advantage versus the other players. It\u2019s just the scale advantage that we have. So we got a customer advantage, we\u2019ve got a brand advantage and we\u2019ve got just a scale advantage, all of which play a part in our model going forward. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then as far as your questions on drivers, et cetera, in California, the changes that we made, it\u2019s too soon to tell at this point. The drivers are reacting quite well to the increase in information that they are receiving. On average the service levels as it relates to riders has gone a little worse as far as a predictability of getting a ride. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re working through pretty carefully. Prices in California are up more than, let\u2019s say the rest of the country as a result of the combination of these factors. So some of these changes are resulting in higher prices to the end customer, but it\u2019s very early and there\u2019s a lot of work to do going forward. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much. Maybe two if I can. Dara when you think about the ride business long-term, how are you thinking about the parts of the penetration curve that can be unlocked from either product innovation or pricing dynamic moves over time? I think one of the biggest questions we get is just sort of how the industry continues to evolve towards disrupting car ownership, mass transit, things that can push the S curve penetration higher over the next sort of five to 10 years.  And then on the Eats side of the business may be using the U.S. as an example, curious how you see the supply dynamics, the relationships with the food industry developing over the next couple of years and how wide a skew there might be in some of the economics of the partnerships you see that evolved in that side of the business. Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. So I think that when we look at the Rides business there are four broad growth vectors. One is geographic growth we talked about markets that were not as penetrated in, that we will drive penetration in the Germany\u2019s, Argentina\u2019s, the Spain\u2019s of the world. Second for us is using technology and improved matching algorithms to improve the efficiency of the marketplace. And that is we think we\u2019re just in a much better place than anyone else, we\u2019ve got higher market density, we\u2019ve got more data than anyone else. That efficiency we can either deliver it to the driver or we can deliver it to the rider depending on what we think the best kind of growth driver is. Third area for us is to drive low costs. And low cost for us is two wheelers, three wheelers, shared rides, once we re-priced those shared rides and then introducing new products like transit, bikes, scooters into our portfolio as well. So it\u2019s a combination of low cost and marketplace that introduces, we think very, very significant TAM to us. And then last but not least, is the enterprise segment. This is Uber for Business, this is segmenting our customer base, our premium customer base, both in terms of service levels and the kind of product that we have out there. It\u2019s less of a factor in terms of bookings growth, but it\u2019s a very significant factor in terms of margin growth. You put it all together and we think we have a very balanced kind of growth profile both top and bottom line going forward. As far as the Eats business goes, we think there\u2019s plenty of room to run. We\u2019ve been really focused on improving selection. I would say that we made big moves in selection in the second half of the year. So I do think that there\u2019s some year-over-year comping on the Eats side, especially in the first half of the year. And we still think we\u2019re in the very early innings. We talked a little bit about, for example, in Australia, where Eats business on a top line basis is comparable to our Rides business. Right now it\u2019s not even close to that on a global basis. So we think that our Eats business has a long way to go. Eric Sheridan : Thanks Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. Just had two. First on Eats you talked about leaning in more and more in 1Q and getting more leverage in the back half of the year. Can you just talk Dara about how far behind you think Eats is on the rationalization path relative to the ride-sharing industry? And then second, can you just talk about your early kind of findings around subscriptions and how that\u2019s working across both Rides and Eats? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, as far as the rationalization goes it\u2019s very tough to predict how markets are going to move. But if we kind of step back the same time last year, you\u2019ll remember that in our Rides segment we leaned in pretty aggressively Q4 and Q1. And then you\u2019ve seen what happened in the second half as it related to Rides margin improvement. It was quite substantial. It\u2019s difficult to predict what\u2019s going to happen in the Eats segment. We do see signs of rationalization in the marketplace. You see it with IPOs coming in. You just see it everywhere. So while it\u2019s impossible for us to predict short-term timing, I think, the long-term rationalization trends are there. And I think we, as a team, have demonstrated a track record of being able to drive rationalization internally and really being able to drive margins internally on with the Rides side. And the Eats team is running the same exact play. They\u2019re just about a year behind the Rides side and appropriately so because we want it to lean into growth on the Eats side. As far as subscription goes, it\u2019s very early, but the results on subscription Rides have been promising for a long time. We really just launched Eats Subs in a few markets pretty recently. And there are markets where it accounts for more than 10% of volume. So we\u2019re pretty encouraged by what we see with Eats Subs. And then really the other area that we\u2019re very, very early in the optimization of is buying kind of an across Uber subscription product as well. So I think really 2020 is going to be the year of subscriptions at Uber. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Shmulik from Bernstein. Your line is open. Mark Shmulik : Yes, hi. Thank you for taking the question. Just to follow-on, on market rationalization and some of the recent investments and divestments that have happened, where are we on that journey in terms of further kind of rationalization from an investment divestment point of view? And as we think about some of that guidance that was shared, does that include or expect to include additional kind of movements in that space? And then we\u2019ve talked a little bit about how it\u2019s behind, but there\u2019s quite aggressive, both take rate and EBITDA targets coming up. How does it get there? Is this a little bit of just flexing kind of pricing, is there a scale up of the ad product or how do we think about the different components that will drive that? Thank you. Nelson Chai : So on the first point in terms of the guidance that is basically our internal plan. So we don\u2019t really build in a lot of M&A divestiture. That being said, we do have a capital allocation process that we go through both for Rides and Eats. And we are working closely with the team in terms of making capital choices. And so you should expect that we\u2019ll continue to make choices. You should expect us to continue to be active in that as we go through it. There may be situations where we\u2019re in two marketplaces when we have to pick, right. But we are committed to being one or two or taking action against that. And you should also expect that if there\u2019s an opportunity for us to lean in, to win a market that we think we want to be that you should expect that action as well. So, when I gave you the guidance it was really our internal plans based on organically where we are today with the same set of businesses. But that being said, we know we have a lot of levers at our disposal, and you should expect that it\u2019s incumbent upon the management team to deliver against the guidance. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then as far as the second question as to our confidence in long-term margins, we have big markets in the Eats business that are pretty close to the long-term revenue margin. So that gives us confidence. We do think that there\u2019s opportunity with media, et cetera, that could actually help attain margins above our long-term guidance, but we don\u2019t want to count on it. And then on the EBITDA side, you can imagine just \u2013 the cost side of the business is much more predictable and we already have over a 100 U.S. and international cities that are segment EBITDA positive in Eats today. And seeing that roadmap, our Rides roadmap, these cities that are positive today gives us a lot of confidence as it relates to long-term Eats margins. Mark Shmulik : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Itay Michaeli from Citi. Your line is open. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a two-part question on ATG, one financial and one strategic. On the financial I was hoping you could dimension what you\u2019re assuming in terms of ATG spend both this year as well as in the longer term? And the strategic question just around timing of when you expect to enter the kind of hybrid market of human drivers and AVs and your thoughts on potential partnerships? And also just the overall competitive environment in AV, just with one of your competitors in San Francisco suggesting that they might be ready to actually deploy Level 4 in the next couple of years, just an update there would be helpful. Thank you. Nelson Chai : Yes, so in terms of \u2013 from a modeling standpoint, I wouldn\u2019t expect a demonstrable difference over the next year or two regarding ATG. There may be some increase, but it won\u2019t be significant. And so I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a big step up there. And as you know, and Dara mentioned in the script, we did raise funds last summer, which effectively pre-funded about 18 months of the ATG development. And so, I think, you should expect us to continue to lean in there on ATG. That being said, I\u2019ll let Dara kind of talk more competitively what we were seeing out there. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes I think the comment that I will make is we don\u2019t think Level 4 for a autonomous service that\u2019s also trying to develop a network is actually commercially viable. Now we need to have what we\u2019ve experienced as you need to have 99 plus percent availability essentially for a daily use case for folks to use you over and over again. So Level 4 doesn\u2019t cut it unless you own a network, and unless you operate a network, or unless you partner with a network. That is actually the key of why we think that ATG isn\u2019t a unique place to succeed and why we\u2019re very much up for partnering players, who may deploy Level 4 and can take advantage of our networks to do so. So I think that\u2019s kind of definitionally to what we\u2019ve been talking about.  Level 4 is coming. It\u2019s coming in the next couple of years. We will be a part of that, but Level 4 and a network together we believe is the only commercially viable product out there. And we\u2019re uniquely situated to play a very important part in that game. Itay Michaeli : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You are welcome. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two if I can. Just first, can you talk broadly about just trends in the competitive environment in the Rideshare segment? Are there any markets where you\u2019re seeing competition pick back up or is it continuing to move in the right direction in the U.S. and globally? And then a second question, just on the 150 basis point take rate improvement in guidance, can you give us a sense for how much of that is going to come from Food Delivery versus Rideshare? And is that a function at all of like price increases or just simply rolling back existing driver incentives? Any anything you can share there? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, see as far as the competitive environment in the U.S. from a long-term standpoint the competitive environment has been constructive, has rationalized. In the past month or so we\u2019ve seen Lyft, our competitor, probably be on balance more aggressive in terms of discounting and incentives. We\u2019ll see where that leads. We think from our standpoint, we\u2019ve spoken about margins and making sure that our investment in marketing, incentives, et cetera, is an investment that makes sense from a return on invested capital basis and are being constructive as it relates to margins going forward.  On a global basis, we have multiple competitors in every single city. We have sometimes competition ebbs. Sometimes, it flows. I\u2019d say it\u2019s largely constructive. And we believe that kind of our future is in our hands because we\u2019re the ones, as the largest player around the globe, who\u2019s kind of setting the standards, so to speak. Nelson you want to answer the second question? Nelson Chai : Yes, in regard to take rate, I mean, I think it\u2019s going to happen both on Rides and Eats. Just as an example, and you heard me in my comments, our Eats take rate in the fourth quarter was 9.5%. But if you exclude India, and as you know, we sold our Indian Eats business, that increased to the 10.1%. So I think as we think about how we continue to work through, as we think about our capital allocation strategy, we are highly confident we\u2019ll be able to increase our Eats take rate. The Rides will just be continuing to play out what we\u2019ve already been doing. And so we do expect that, that will increase as well. And it\u2019s really not one big thing. It\u2019s the combination of both and just getting more efficiency In terms of how we\u2019re spending. Lloyd Walmsley : All right, thank you. Kent Schofield : Welcome, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Great, thanks for taking the question. Dara, I wanted to ask a little bit more about Eats and contribution margin as take rates get to that 15% level. And I ask only because over today, Grab talked about relatively low margins on QSR and non-partner orders and the comment earlier today that you\u2019ve added a lot of non partners to the business within Eats. So just can you talk a little bit about maybe contribution margins on partners and non-partners on the network? And really, how would those margins expand over time as we get to that profitability? Thank you. Nelson Chai : Yes, Ron, our non-partner volume for Eats is very, very small as a percentage of our overall volume. This is a new feature that the team built out really in Q4. We\u2019re being careful in rolling out the feature because we want to make sure that the delivery times, the delivery qualities continue to be at the levels of excellence that we insist on. So I would not assume that non-partner revenues are a significant percentage of our volume certainly in Q4. Next year, we are going to build up our non-partner volume, but we\u2019ll make sure that we do it in a way that makes sense both for the top line and the bottom line. Ron Josey : Got it, thank you. Nelson Chai : Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Your line is open Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Maybe I\u2019ll ask about California. What have you learned since making product changes in California? What\u2019s driver feedback, rider feedback? And how has it changed usage in spending? Thanks. Nelson Chai : Hey Jason again I would stress that it\u2019s very, very early. Driver feedback has been positive in terms of the information, the empowerment that I think our driver partners feel. I think that the service itself, prices have increased more than they have nationally. So I think from a rider standpoint, the service on balance has gotten more expensive. But it\u2019s very, very early. And I would comment, too, that 85 in general for a number of contractors, et cetera, has created a huge amount of uncertainty. We rolled out these changes to be very clear about our position as a platform and to make sure that our drivers have the freedom to choose when and if they want to work. We\u2019re going to be working through \u2013 we want this to be a win-win for our drivers and for the riders on our platform. And we\u2019re going to be iterating to get there. Short term, it\u2019s been, I\u2019d say, net negative for riders, and it\u2019s possibly a net positive for drivers. Hopefully, we can get to a win-win situation. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Nelson Chai : You are welcome. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from Youssef Squali from SunTrust. Your line open. Youssef Squali : Great, thank you very much. Dara, on Careem in the Middle East or North Africa, could you please tell us a bit more about that business? How big is the growth rate profitability? And anything either from a technology or a product standpoint that they have that you can leverage or vice versa. And on the Eats business, I think you said earlier that you are number one or number two in every market in roughly half of the countries in which you operate, which means roughly half of the countries in where you operate, you\u2019re not number one, number two. What does that mix look like in your base case projection of breaking even by Q4? Thank you. Nelson Chai : This is Nelson. So on Careem we\u2019re actually not breaking that out. As you know, the deal just closed. And I think over time, we\u2019ll probably give some more disclosure around it. But right now, we\u2019re not going to break that out. We know that it will be positive in terms of its impact on the business. And the team has actually done a very good job in terms of building out their marketplace. There are some things we can learn from there that the teams are working on right now, but it\u2019s really too early to tell, because remember, the deal just closed a few weeks ago. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I\u2019d say on the Careem side, we\u2019ve talked about the steps that we made as it relates to the power of the platform and the Super App strategy. The Careem team is absolutely looking to drive the Super App strategy in the Middle East. I think some of these developing markets, that particular strategy has great potential. We see incredible innovation from that local team across the number of services, including payments as well. So I think that we\u2019re going to be learning from the Careem team, and they\u2019re going to be learning from us. They\u2019ve made real investments in their driver relations, captains in Careem-speak, so to speak. And again, that\u2019s something that we can learn from. We really want to deepen our relationship with our earners around the world, and we\u2019ve seen really interesting activity from the Careem team that we can all learn from.  As far as our Eats business, number one and number two, we\u2019ve been really encouraged by our trends that we saw in Q4. We definitely leaned in to get to more ones and number twos. And I think next year, we continue \u2013 we expect more of the same. We\u2019ve been gaining category position in most of the countries in which we operate. And we\u2019re pretty confident that by the end of next year, we end of next year, we\u2019re going to be number one and number two with a vast majority of our volume. Most of it will be organic and some of it will be inorganic, both on the buy and sell side. Youssef Squali : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You are welcome. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from John Blackledge from Cowen. Your line is open. Dara Khosrowshahi : Hi, John. John Blackledge : Great. Thanks. On Uber for Business, the growth was stellar. It was about 9% of the Rides growth bookings. Could you just discuss how that mix might change over time? Kind of any differences in penetration, U.S. versus non-U.S. markets and the margin profile for Uber for Business kind of relative to the overall Rides segment margin? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I think the trend for Uber for Business is pretty simple, which is it\u2019s going to be a higher percentage of our bookings going forward and certainly a higher percentage of revenue. On average, the Uber for Business has a higher premium share. And our premium business is higher margin than, let\u2019s say, our X or other products. We are going to be investing relatively heavily in growing the U for B sales force. We have a more mature and larger sales force in the U.S. versus, let\u2019s say, Europe and some of the other countries. So expect us to lean in on the sales force. Usually, when you expand a sales force upfront, that\u2019s probably negative margins or, call it, breakeven margins. But then the lifetime value that our sales teams bring in over three, four, five years make a lot of sense. And then when we do look at the retention of U for B customers, the retention rates are substantially higher than, call it, leisure customers or non U for B customers. So long term, as U for B becomes a higher percentage of our business, expect our marketing efficiencies to improve. John Blackledge : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You are welcome. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from James Lee from Mizuho. Your line is open. James Lee : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Dara, I was wondering if you can give more color on the competition LATAM. You talked about that market being more stable since 2019. We heard that DiDi recently entered into some new markets? Any new learnings there? Are you doing well because your competitor is now more disciplined? Or are you responding faster to their marketing initiatives? And also, Dara, can you give an update on your status on UK regulatory situation there, how you expect that to play out? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, absolutely. So in terms of our LATAM markets, I think, it\u2019s a combination. I think, generally, the competitive environment is \u2013 remains quite competitive, but more stable on a year-on-year basis. DiDi is a competitor that we do not take for granted. They\u2019re very good at what they do. But if you look at our numbers, for example, our ANR growth rate in LATAM was pretty significant on a year-on-year basis, and it turned positive and very nicely positive. So we like the trends that we see in the LATAM markets. We think that we are more effective in our response. And we think that just year-on-year, the market is much more predictable. Our LATAM market is \u2013 or LATAM represents our fastest-growing mega region. And from a trips basis, it is the largest region that we have on the Rides side as well. So we\u2019re quite optimistic there. And then in London, as far as regulatory goes, we\u2019re going to have our day in court. We respectfully disagree with TFL\u2019s conclusions. I\u2019ll remind you that two years ago, in court, we won the right to operate in London. And I think that our safety levels, our service levels are across the board, significantly, significantly improved versus where they were two years ago. The team is very focused on executing on safety around the world. And I think London \u2013 the London team especially is focused on it. So we expect that our day in court will be positive, but we know that we\u2019ve got to make the case. In the meantime, we operate in London as we have, as always, and where we continue to optimize our business. And it\u2019s like any other day in London as far as our operations go. Dara Khosrowshahi : Well, thank you very much everyone for joining. We really appreciate your being here. I think 2019 was a big, big year for us. We know that we\u2019ve got a lot to deliver on 2020, but the team is confident, and the team is psyched to execute, and to also build a great company and provide a great service for all of our users. Thanks very much for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Following prepared remarks today, we will open the call for questions. For the remainder of the discussion, all growth rates reflect year-over-year growth unless otherwise noted. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Emily. And thank you all for joining us today. Since seven weeks I updated you last on the state of our business. In that time there were some hopeful signs. Cities are beginning to open up or at the very least plan for recovery, early but promising results in clinical trials for potential treatments in vaccines and perhaps most inspiring of all, global solidarity in support of those on the frontlines, but there remains a lot unknown. Clear that the cities, states, and countries will take action to reopen at different speeds and in different way and there is a little consensus over the right way to do it. Given this backdrop, I want to tell you how I'm managing Uber both through this crisis and for the long-term. My objective is based on the old Wayne Gretzky quote, \u2018skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.\u2019 For Uber that means tight focus in three key areas. First, while we have a very strong balance sheet, it's my job to ensure that remains the case, regardless of how fast or slow the recovery is. Accordingly, we are taking a hard look at our overall cost structure and our other bets to ensure our core business of Rides and Eats emerges stronger than ever. We significantly reduced our marketing incentive spend and deferred to real estate CapEx for planned offices in Chicago, Dallas, and Mexico City. Careem our wholly-owned subsidiary in the Middle East took the difficult step of reducing its workforce by 31%. Yesterday, consistent with lower trip volumes and our hiring freeze, we announced a reduction in our customer support and recruiting teams by more than 3,700 employees. And this morning, we announced that we're merging our JUMP unit into Lime. With this deal, Uber customers will still have access to bikes and scooters through our app, resulting in an annual EBITDA savings of 160 million in addition to meaningful CapEx savings. All together, the actions we've taken and the actions we intend to take in the near future will result in a reduction of more than 1 billion in annualized fixed cost versus our Q4 plan. Reaching profitability as soon as possible remains a strategic priority for us. We believe that disruption caused by COVID-19 will impact our timeline, by a matter of quarters and not years. Second, at a time when our Rides business is down significantly due to shelter-in-place, our Eats business is surging. We've seen an enormous acceleration in demand since mid-March, with 89% year-over-year gross bookings growth in April, excluding India. And just last week, Eats crossed the $25 billion gross bookings annual run rate. Additionally, there's been a tremendous increase in restaurant signups leading up to rapid improvement in selection in major markets like the U.S., as well as behavioral shifts, but the willingness of \u2013 on the part of fine dining establishments to sign up for delivery. We believe these trends are here to stay and will result in an expansion of the entire category.  Some of you will recall my commitment on our Q3 2019 call to invest aggressively only in markets where we are confident we can establish or defend a number one or number two position. Consistent with that strategy, on Monday we announced Eats will exit eight countries. This move will allow us to redouble our efforts in markets with larger long-term potential and higher returns like the U.S. Improving Eats margin and cost structure over time, just as we did with Rides remains a key priority and we're seeing improvements due to larger order sizes, improved courier efficiency, and more efficient marketing, and customer acquisition. Finally, I want to talk about what we're seeing in our Rides business today and I won't sugarcoat it. COVID-19 has had a dramatic impact on Rides with the business down globally around 80% in April. Still, there's some green shoots driving restrained optimism. We\u2019ve seen week-on-week growth globally for the past three weeks. This week is tracking to be our fourth consecutive week of growth. Last week, we saw 9% [indiscernible] growth and 12% gross bookings growth globally weak-on-weak. We believe the U.S. is of the bottom. U.S. gross bookings were up last week by 12% overall week-on-week, including New York City up 14%, San Francisco up 8%, Los Angeles up 10%, and Chicago up 11%. Perhaps more interestingly, gross bookings in large cities across Georgia and Texas, these are two states that have started opening up significantly, are up substantially from the bottom at 43% and 50%, respectively. Hong Kong is back to 70% of pre-crisis gross bookings levels. And in India, we began operating again in designated green and orange zones, which account for more than 80% of the country's 733 districts. In France, a survey of Riders who were active before COVID shows two-thirds expected to take their next Uber ride within a month. 90% expected to do the same in less than three months and 98% of all riders say they will take a trip again suggesting pre-COVID usage will build back steadily. Nevertheless, it's very early days. Our expectation is that the recovery will vary geographically and will be nonlinear, meaning we'll see some markets or recovery while others temporarily retreat. As the only truly scale global player, we think this represents an advantage, both in terms of revenue coming in, as well as operational insights we can apply across markets. Today we've seen that the rebound has led by weekday nine to five trips, including commute use cases. For reference in 2019 80% of our gross bookings were delivered from trips in a user's home city, meaning people traveled around their own communities and 95% from trips in a user's home country. We expect that a recovery led primarily by commute trips will open up exciting new prospects for Uber for business, as companies look to move their employees to and from offices, as well as partnership opportunities with transit agencies to move essential workers. We\u2019re aggressively pursuing both and already working with MTA in New York to do the latter. Now, a bit more on our Q1 performance. Our Rides business experienced strong momentum through February with year-over-year gross bookings growth of nearly 20% for the two month period, consistent with Q4 2019. As lockdowns began to affect their business in mid-March, we experienced trip and gross bookings declines of nearly 40%. And despite this sudden deterioration, we're able to maintain strong Q1 take rate of 22.8% and Rides adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.5% of adjusted net revenue, clearly demonstrating the variable cost structure of our Rides business. Our Rides focus has now turned to recovery, specifically on providing safe experience for drivers and riders as they start to move around the communities again. And as we publicly confirmed several days ago, we're working through plans to require drivers and riders to wear masks or face coverings when using Uber in certain countries, including the U.S. As a category leader, we tend to continue to set the standard for safety moving forward. As our Rides business recovers, we believe we have a structural advantage for a number of reasons. Rides-only players have been disproportionately impacted. While our Rides bookings were down 80% in April, a total company is only off about 40% helped significantly by Eats. Eats has also allowed us to maintain high engagement with our existing customers and to bring in new customers onto our platform. This positions us to have a faster recovery than Rides-only players. We also have a profitable Rides business globally with many non-U.S. markets that are higher margin allowing us to cross subsidized as necessary. Our marketplace will also enter recovery from a position of strength since we have a larger rider and driver base. Poorly many drivers have spent their time on Uber during this period because we've been able to offer them an alternative source of work in food delivery. Finally, we expect that shared Rides will be less important in the near-term. This was historically sweet spot for a primary competitor in the U.S. with around a 50% category position on shared Rides. Now turning to Eats, which performed extremely well in Q1 generating 4.7 billion gross bookings up 54% year-on-year and accelerating net revenue to 124% growth year-on-year, while expanding take rate to 11.3%, and significantly reducing EBITDA loss to 313 million. In addition to our core Eats product, we're seeing strong demand for grocery and convenience items. Given that we've accelerated our plans, launching partnerships with supermarket chains and convenience stores around the world allowing them to sell a limited menu of everyday essentials via a restaurant platform. From early March levels, grocery and convenience gross bookings increased 117% over the same period, while active storefronts increased 34%, including Carrefour, one of Europe's largest supermarket chains. Finally, in the next few months, we expect to closer our acquisition of Cornershop, one of the largest grocery delivery platforms in Latin America, with operations in Chile, Mexico, Brazil, as well as Toronto. Given the expected stickiness of grocery post-COVID and a footprint in LatAm we look forward to closing this transaction as soon and creating an integrated product across the corner ship, Uber, and Uber Eats apps. While no one could have predicted the swift and intense impact that COVID would have had on our lives and our business, I'm incredibly proud of the quick and decisive action our team has taken to respond to that ever changing environment. And now, over to Nelson for more details on the numbers. Nelson Chai : Thanks, Dar. Now onto the GAAP results Q1 2020 with comparisons year-over-year unless otherwise noted. Our GAAP revenue of 3.5 billion was up 14%. GAAP cost of revenues excluding D&A of 1.8 billion decreased to 50% from 54% of revenue in Q1 of 2019. GAAP EPS was a loss of $1.70, and compares to a loss of $2.23 in Q1 of 2019. For the remainder of the call, unless otherwise noted, I will discuss key operational metrics as well as non-GAAP financial measures, excluding pro forma adjustments, such as stock-based compensation. Our total global trips of 1.7 billion grew 7%. Global trips were driven primarily by growth in Eats, particularly in EMEA and Latin America. MAPCs were 103 million, up 11%. As a reminder, our MAPCs are calculated as an average during the three months of the quarter and margins heavily impacted by the pandemic. Total company gross bookings of 15.8 billion grew 8% or 10% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted net revenue or ANR was 3.3 billion, up 19% on a constant currency basis, our ANR take rate was 20.6% of gross bookings, up 180 basis points as both Rides and Eats improved take rates. Non-GAAP cost of revenues, excluding D&A decreased to 46% from 50% of ANR. Insurance and payments as a percent of ANR improved quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Turning now to non-GAAP operating expenses, operations and support decreased year-over-year to 15% from 16% of adjusted net revenue reflecting continued ride support efficiency improvements, partially offset by a mix shift to Eats, but we are making progress automating customer support, but were contact rates remained higher than Rides. Sales and marketing decreased to 26% from 36% of adjusted net revenue versus Q1 2019. This decrease is primarily due to lower marketing and promotion spend, particularly in Rides. R&D remained flat at 15% of adjusted net revenue. G&A increased to 18% from 15% of ANR versus a year ago quarter. Quarter-over-quarter our spend remained relatively flat, but increased as a percentage of adjusted net revenue, due to the top line pressure and COVID-19. Our Q1 2020 total adjusted EBITDA loss of $612 million or $257 million improvement year-over-year. Now, I'll provide additional detail on our segments. Rides gross bookings of 10.9 billion declined 3% on a constant currency basis led by the U.S. due to the COVID-19 impact taking hold in March offset by positive growth in Latin America and EMEA. Rides ANR of 2.5 billion grew 6% on a constant currency basis for take rate of 22.8%, which improved both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to rationalization of incentive spend, mainly in the U.S. Importantly, Global Rides gross bookings and ANR on a constant currency basis and excluding shared rides were growing in the mid-20% and high-20% respectively during the month of January and February. Rides adjusted EBITDA of 581 million or 23.5% of ANR in the months January and February rises, producing a record 30% adjusted EBITDA margin. Eats gross bookings of 4.7 billion grew 54% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued tailwind from stay-at-home orders in the U.S. and international markets. Eats ANR of 527 million, up to 124% on a constant currency basis due to a mix shift towards small and medium sized restaurants driving higher basket sizes, coupled with courier payment efficiencies mainly in the U.S. Excluding Eats, India which we divested to Zomato in January of this year, Eats take rate was 11.6%. This represents a significant 150 basis point improvement quarter-on-quarter, which puts us well on our path to achieving our 15% long-term take rate target. Importantly, we are confident these take great improvements are structural improvements. Eats adjusted EBITDA loss was 313 million for negative 59.4% of ANR. That does represent a 50% or $148 million quarter-over-quarter improvement. Given this large improvement quarter-over-quarter, we expect each Eats adjusted EBITDA losses in Q2 to be similar to Q1, which would be another year-over-year improvement, despite Eats gross bookings likely coming in well above our plan. Furthermore, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to continue to improve in Q3.  Uber Freight grew ANR to 199 million and adjusted EBITDA loss of 64 million. Our Other Bets segment had ANR of 30 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of 63 million. Of course, given the deal we announced today with Lime, the vast majority of these losses will move off of our P&L. ATG\u2019s adjusted net EBITDA was a loss of 108 million and our Q1 2020 corporate G&A and platform R&D was 645 million, which represents the G&A and R&D not allocated to one of our five segments increased 14%. In terms of liquidity, we ended the quarter with approximately $9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, with access to over $2 billion from our revolver. Since then, we have paid 900 million of the 1.5 billion in Careem and Cornershop commitments for 2020 that we discussed on our March 19 call. We expect 2020 CapEx to be in the $550 million to $600 million range. In January and February, we reproduced the Ride segment EBITDA margin of 30% of ANR, a 22% year-over-year improvement over Q1 2019\u2019s margin of 8%. By focusing on efficiency and cost savings across the Rides P&L. In Eats, we continue to make progress demonstrated by our quarter-over-quarter segment EBITDA margin improvement of 46% as a percentage of ANR. We will continue to make progress towards our Eats long-term profitability targets.  And finally, while a lot remains unknown, you can expect us to continue to focus on liquidity, exercise prudent financial discipline, and take action to maintain or position our strength. Our goal remains the same, returning our growth to business and achieving profitability for all of our stakeholders, which we are now planning to achieve on an adjusted EBITDA basis on a quarterly basis in 2021. With that, now I'll open it up to questions. Dara Khosrowshahi : Alright, operator, can we get started? Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : [Indiscernible] taking my question. I have two. Just, the first one, Dara, I wanted to kind of pick your brain a little bit on the way you think about new business opportunities and the way the business overall can emerge and change post-COVID and into 2021? You talked a little about grocery and essentials, maybe talk to us about other opportunities you see and other investments need to make to really capitalize on those. Then the second one, just around safety for riders and drivers, maybe talk to us about how you think about using technology and innovation to really improve the safety of the rides for everyone. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, Brian. Absolutely. So, in general, as far as new business goes, you know there is a silver lining to this unbelievably tragic COVID virus, which is the business that we have of Eats and the category in general, just looks like it is going to be substantially increased and somewhat say by multiples, and we had already signed up an agreement to buy the majority of Cornershop, which is a very big grocery player in LatAm as well. And so, we know the grocery segment, we've got a great team from Cornershop who's working on grocery, and essentially, we're going to bring Cornershop and when that deal closes, and hopefully give the Cornershop audience the significant kind of exposure that our Rides app and our Eats app brings on a global basis. We haven't closed yet, so we don't have specific plans, but you can imagine the opportunity there. So, as far as new opportunity goes, you know, the new opportunities aren't a stretch. The big opportunity that we thought Eats was just got bigger. You can see that from the acceleration of our Q1 growth rates, which actually beat our own internal plans, and Q2, growth rates are substantially increased, and then with grocery, we've already started with some essentials as it relates to Eats, we've got grocery coming in. And then we're developing some new services, such as Uber Connect and Uber Direct, where retailers can send packages, and also we can send [P2B packages] as well. So when you put this all together, actually the core business and the opportunities in the core business look much bigger, and we don't have to look far for very substantial continuing growth going forward. That's how we look at it. And then as far as safety for riders and drivers go, you know, we have been leaders and safety, safety has been an absolute priority of this company ever since I joined. We were leaders in terms of safety for riders and drivers previously, and now we're absolutely looking at \u2013 it's a combination of logistics and technology. We're shipping millions of PPE and masks, cleaning supplies, etcetera to our drivers to make sure that that first drive and the second and continuing drugs that our riders take are safe and they feel safe. And we are looking at technologies such as for example, our selfie technology, where we make sure that the driver who has been \u2013 who signed up is the actual driver who's driving, we can use that technology, for example, potentially, to make sure that the driver is wearing a mask where appropriate. So, we're absolutely exploring technology and you need a combination of technology, logistics, and local knowhow in order to operate safely at the kind of scale that we do on a Global basis. So, we absolutely believe we\u2019re going to be the leaders in defining the safety of this platform going forward. Brian Nowak : Great, thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : Good day. Could you talk about market share trends for Rides in your bigger businesses? Obviously U.S., Mexico, and London, what you're seeing there, are there opportunities for you to take some share here in this environment? And then with travel, I know it's an important topic, airport trips. Can you talk about how important they are or just remind us on bookings and then how important they are for profitability? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. In terms of shared dynamics, and then Nelson will take the airport question. You know, in terms of shared dynamics, we did see early on and this year, we made certain adjustments to our model in California to really solidify our position as a platform and solidify our position in terms of independent work, our drivers getting more information, the payments going directly to drivers etc. And that did result in some loss in category position in California markets. We haven't seen substantial changes since, and frankly with business being down so much of data is pretty sparse. In Mexico and the UK, nothing, you know, I\u2018d say the share, the share in general has been pretty stable. There's lots of competitors out there, multiple competitors in both \u2013 in the UK and in Mexico, but shared trends and I would say the aggressiveness of promotions etcetera were pretty stable going into COVID. We haven't seen things change significantly during this period. And I think some of you may have heard our competitors saying in general, kind of promotions are down, couponing is down, and I think a lot of competitors are focused more on profitability. So, we don't see much remarkable. Coming out of this crisis, we do think we have an advantage because we are engaged with customers and millions and millions of eaters today, that engagement is substantial. With grocery and other products, we're going to increase that engagement. Already with our drivers, for example, about 40% of our drivers who were active with Rides have been crossed dispatched to Eats in the month of April, which is an all-time high. So, the engagement that we have gives us a structural advantage, coming back from the crisis without our having to spend a bunch of capital buying our way into category positions, so to speak. Nelson, you want to talk about airports? Nelson Chai : Yeah, so Just airports are important to us, but as Dara said in his prepared remarks, you know, 80% of our gross bookings are actually delivered from the user's home. So, for us, airports are about 15% of our Rides gross bookings, and about 16% of our Rides segment, EBITDA. So it is important and we do expect that that recovery will take a little bit longer. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : Dara, you mentioned that Georgia and Texas cities are up 50% from the bottom. So, I assume that means they're 20% of peak now up to 30% peak, does that sound right? And how does the curve on the recovery in those open cities look, compared to Hong Kong at the same stage? And do you think that is Hong Kong now will get back to 70%? Are they taking share from public transportation, any color on that will be great? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, Ross it\u2019s too soon to tell regarding the share from transportation. I'll start with Hong Kong. The recovery is uneven. We've had certain weeks where Hong Kong was down; 40% from peak 50% from peak, now it's definitely getting better. So, time \u2013 so, certainly the passage of time seems to be pushing trends in the positive direction. I think it's too early to say whether or not there is share being taken from public transport. I\u2019m talking to many of our U4B customers. They are expressing some consternation at bringing back their employees and using public transport.  So, I'd say from a conversational basis from feedback that we're getting, especially from U4B customers it does seem like commute is going to be the used case that's going to lead. And I wouldn't be surprised if there's some share shift from transit, but it's too early to tell at this point. I will also say that we believe that we can help transit come back. We absolutely believe in partnerships with transit agencies. You've seen us put transit on our app, but more and more we're offering services to transit, for example, during off hours, you know, between for MTA between midnight and I think it' s 5 :00 A.M. during hours when it just doesn't make sense to run a transit system and or they\u2019re not going to clean. So, I do think that we can be a part of the solution as to how cities get to move again. I think we'll be one of the early movers and we're certainly going to look to partner with transit going forward. As far as Georgia and Texas, Nelson do you know the particulars as to whether what percentage of peak they are? I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d say they're smaller markets, but the trends definitely look better, but also anything to add there? Nelson Chai : Yeah, yeah, no, I don't know. Maybe, can Emily \u2013 you can follow up. Dara Khosrowshahi : Alright, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Heath Terry : Dara, obviously, you've made a lot of progress on this commitment to rationalizing markets where you're not number one, number two, do you have any sense for your competitors that fall into that category, the markets where they're not number one, number two, to what degree you're seeing or expect to see sort of similar action? Action out of them I obviously know you are not in their head, but you know, to the extent that you know, using your gut and your industry knowledge sort of what you expect to see on that front. Any sense of timing that you might have? Dara Khosrowshahi : Heath from a macro standpoint, I would say rationalization both in the Rides category and in the food category has been the name of the game. All of these competitors have been burning money for a long time. We're really unique in the Rides category of scale and that we're global and in Rides very, very profitable. Our EBITDA margins were running over 30% as a percentage of A&R in Jan, Feb. And I think in the Eats category, in the food category, you were seeing a bunch of consolidation. There's a bunch of consolidation happening on a global basis, where bigger players can not only provide better service for restaurants and consumers, but can provide a better service kind of on an economic basis that that is sustainable. I do think there's a question, which is, this food delivery grocery category just got a lot bigger. There's a ton of new customers coming to this category. And what we're seeing with a category is the biggest challenge is kind of new customer acquisition, then there's very high frequency, very high satisfaction of the product. So, we think there's, there's just kind of this booster in terms of the category. My instinct is that the commercial and the capital kind of rationalization is still going to continue, but it is a big category and big categories that just got bigger tend to attract some capital. So, my instinct is, you know, you'll see similar plays from other players. The market seems to like rationalization, and I think ultimately the markets are going to drive long-term behavior, but you know, the category got bigger and capital chases the category and certainly growth is at a premium right now. So, we'll see. It's hard to be absolutely productive. Ross Sandler : Thanks, Dara. Really appreciate it. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Doug Anmuth : [Indiscernible] for taking the question. Dara, you talked about the 40% of U.S. and Canada drivers who\u2019ve crossed dispatch to Eats in April, how do you ensure their loyalty as you come out of the crisis? And then secondly, just wanted to ask you about your investments in ATG, and what you're thinking is there during this time? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, Doug. You know, the loyalty of both our Riders and drivers is based on the service that we provide them. And we want to make sure, you know, that that our drivers feel safe. And I do think that in the recovery scenario, as these countries open up, our platform is going to be an incredibly important platform for people to start earning again. So, I think if we bring the volume and we have a structural advantage in that, our volume with Rides is not only going to come back and you know, we don't know exactly how fast it\u2019s going to come back, but it's on the comeback trail, but having Eats just provide the structural advantage, and ultimately, it's about the service that takes care of them in terms of safety. And then it's the ability to earn again, during a time, when you know, the economic damage to a lot of folks in need has been very, very significant. And you also remember that we were consistently, you know, first, and for example providing our drivers with help if they were diagnosed with COVID or they have to shelter-at-home. So, I think we've consistently shown leadership and we're there for them and you know, we're not going to stop them from working on any other platform or using any other platform or an open platform, but I think if we're consistent, we take care of them and we give them an opportunity to earn, I think we'll be just fine. As far as our ATG investments, listen, I think this is from a long-term standpoint. ATG has always been a long-term investment, you could hypothesize that some people are going to be \u2013 are going to feel safer with a car that is driven by a robot than a person. Our job number one is to make sure that they feel safe with the person driving, but the fundamental ATG technology, its relevance, the market size hasn't changed. That said, in a market like this, where capital is dear and we bring discipline to everything that we do, we are asking every part of the company that includes ATG, to make sure that every dollar you spend is $1 that brings a return and that's going to include the ATG Group, as well as other groups. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You bet. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : [Indiscernible] taking the question, maybe a few on Eats. You know Dara wanted to get your perspective as more supply comes into the Eats business, what you're seeing from a competitive dynamic on either driving demand on the user side, and how sort of a more level playing field of supply in some markets is playing out in terms of end-market demand and market share? And then what does that mean to the long-term profitability of Eats? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Eric, in terms of supply, we are absolutely improving on the supply front, both on absolute basis and relative to our competitors as well. We've signed up Chipotle, we signed up Shake Shack, we've got Dunkin on our platform as well. So, there are big brands that are coming onto our platform that that creates more demand. And the more choice we have, the more restaurants we have available per search, we see conversion going up. So, I think on the on the restaurant supply front, we are making progress, we are not satisfied. We think that there's significant progress to be made. And what's interesting is, we're seeing the kind of acceleration in growth rates that we're seeing in April, and it continues in May, if anything is improving. Despite my belief and I think the team's belief that we can do better on the supply front. So, if I were to characterize our Eats business, we're not fully optimized on supply. We're still signing up a ton of restaurants. These restaurants need us and we want to make sure we're there for them, and right now the trends in terms of supply look very, very good. Now, I do think that the big brands and the national brands or the global brands are really important elements of our marketplace. I would make sure folks know that our small and medium restaurants still account for the vast majority of our volume and are a big part or are going to continue to be a big part of our volume going forward. So, the big brands are kind of great customer acquisition vehicles. They're terrific food quality. They're safe. They bring a lot of folks in, but small and medium businesses and restaurants continue to be a significant part of our business and our growth going forward. In terms of the margins, revenue margins, you've seen the trends and I think we can continue to improve revenue margins. This is about generally SMBs have higher margins. We are improving our courier efficiencies. The more demand we have kind of the more concentration we can have in market. We can batch more couriers, courier\u2019s kind of carrying more than one package, etcetera. And in general, better technology can improve our revenue margin as far as utilization goes as well. So, I do think that the take rate improvements that you have seen are going to continue. And we're quite confident there. Nelson Chai : The only other thing I would add is that you can [here to see] exit non-performing countries, like we did yesterday, earlier this week, and like we did in India, and so we're going to continue to optimize and you know, work hard in our capital allocation model. Dara Khosrowshahi : And just to just to give folks a little more character on SMBs, you know SMP gross bookings grew at three times the pace of our non SMP business from February to April. So, SMB is growing really, really quickly, and our SMB self service business grew at 70%, which is like five times the pace of non-SMB businesses over the same period. So, this is SMB structurally, one is, we're helping a lot of these restaurants stay in business during incredibly difficult times. So, it's like we're doing good, but it's also structurally good for the business going forward. Eric Sheridan : Great, thanks for all the color. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein. Mark Shmulik : [Indiscernible] taking the question, a couple I may. The first, you know, you share the stat around, you know, 40% of drivers, being able to move over and support the Eats business, any color in terms of the demand side and the customers? You know, how many of those Uber Ride sharing folks are now adopting and trying at Eats? And then anything around cost of acquisition that you could talk about would be great around any discounts offered versus like pre-COVID level, how much in-bound demand are you seeing would be great? And then for my second question, it's always tough to make headcount reductions. It sounds like a lot of the folks have been in the recruiting and customer service departments, how much of that headcount kind of comes back as demand comes back? And then, you know, are there any incremental efficiencies you see here with kind of a new way of doing business? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, absolutely. As far as the demand side, I don't want to disclose any particulars, but we have been using the Rides platform, and we're getting more and more effective in using the Rides platform to cross promote into Eats. You'll see that in some of the designs of our Rides app, which is they'll be right up front, Rides and Eats and other categories. For example, grocery could be another category, transit could be another category. So, on the product side, we're getting much better and I\u2019d say we are in the early innings of continuing to cross promote different kinds of services. This is also going to be possible on Eats. Again, grocery and some of the neighboring services as well. So, we have seen substantial pickup, a higher and higher percentage of our Rides customers are using Eats. And I think that we're generally in the early innings there. The one exception I will tell you is there are certain markets in Europe, for example, where restaurants have closed, so restaurant supply is well down. So, on those markets, you don't see as much of the cross-pollination. As far as the cost of acquisition trends, though, we're seeing actually pretty hopeful trends. There's always a trade-off between cost of acquisition and then the amount of volume that you can bring in. So, you know, you can keep the same cost of acquisition and push volume or you can optimize for acquisition costs. In general, we are happy with our cost of acquisition. We continue to improve our, our technology there are tracking there. We still think we have improvement ahead of us. And in general, we think we can be in a place where we are pushing for volume at the same customer acquisition costs or less, and be able to improve revenue margins and EBITDA margins overall on our Eats business. It's just we're at a very good place. The teams are executing well, and the technology and the capabilities are getting better and better. If you look at Eats for example, monthly active platform. Consumers are up to 50% year-on-year since Q1 of 2019, and I don't think anyone on the team would say that we are doing, as well as we can or should on the customer acquisition front. Nelson, you want to talk about the headcount, and how much comes from back-end or how much comes back as demand comes back? Nelson Chai : They're not. I would be happy to. So, yes, we did make the move and as everybody knows, those are tough decisions that have to be made. We do expect that as business continues to grow, I don't think we will, you'll see us adding back at that same level. As you know, the companies have been very much focused on efficiency and what we call contactless service. And we've been seeing good marks there. And so you'll see us continue and then the only other thing I'd want to add is that, you know, we're continuing to look across our business and our platform for more efficiencies, and so you should make sure that as you get off the call that you hear that. I think the deal that you saw today that we did with Lime as well is also a good proxy. The reality is, the world has changed, right? And so we don't know when the recovery is going to be. We think we're very well-positioned today. It's [incumbent] upon us to make sure we come out of this even stronger and better positioned. It's not lost upon us, we are going to take the actions that we think are necessary that we continue to strengthen our core Rides in these businesses and there is no sacred cows. And so we are going to look at everything across the whole platform and so that is something that is going on right now. Dara Khosrowshahi : Alright. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein : Two questions I guess. On Eats, it looks like you are coming from a lower take rate you\u2019re your peers, there\u2019s probably some mix issues and we look to consolidate it, but just talk about what that means, you know you\u2019re kind of coming from low to higher and a lot of them are going from higher to lower and kind of what that does with your position with the restaurants? And then, has there been any discussions on, as cities try to deal with social distancing, particularly [indiscernible] cities, is there things that you can do to work with them, etcetera that that could work out in your favor? Thank you. Nelson Chai : So, I'll take the first one. I think Dara will take the second part of that. So, in terms of the margins, it\u2019s very difficult to look across the different Eats companies and compare because as you know, some are \u2013 many of them are either single geography or just a few. And as you know, we're global and so we operate in over 50 countries. And so it's very, very difficult. And so, as you know, we've been taking the actions in order to improve our Eats profitability, including the actions we took earlier this week. And took the actions we took in the beginning of the year when we took our India Business and sold it into Zomato. And so, it is very difficult to do that. If you look peer-on-peer in this, there are some places in some countries where we are over indexed against some of the large chains, and so that will tend to drive down the take rates, versus a competitor that is more SMB, but as you heard from Dara\u2019s commentary, we're seeing tremendous growth as we continue to build up our SMB businesses, as well as our customers, as well as even some of the smaller, higher-end businesses that are signing up now as a result of COVID-19. And so that really is driving the take rate improvement that we're seeing, and that we should continue to expect to see into the second and third quarter. We're seeing this, we're seeing higher basket sizes. We are taking some operational steps on career efficiency, and this will all translate into us continue to make progress against our longer-term Eats target margins. Dara you want to cover the other part of the question? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, absolutely. I think as far as social distancing and working either with cities or states or countries listen we're going to be responsible. We want to be part of the solution, and not part of the problem. And you've seen that, for example, with our app when there were shelter-in-place and someone tried to use the Uber app, we'd make sure that they really needed to use the Uber app. We're now focused much more on PPE making sure that our drivers have masks, shipping cleaning supplies, advising Riders on the norms for them to ride as well, because we want everyone to be safe, Riders wearing masks or encouraging them to wear mask, encouraging them to wash hands, etc. So, we're a very big platform and as part of being a big platform, we're going to work with city, states, and our constituencies to make sure that we are helping educate the public so that we can have a return to the kind of the life that we all loved, but also do so in a responsible way, and we're absolutely going to be part of that solution. And as far as transit goes, again, you can see some of the partnerships that we\u2019re striking with transit agencies. We are going to be there step-by-step, and to be part, again of turning these cities back on, but making sure that we're turning it back on in a safe way. Alright, next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Want to ask about, to the extent to which this crisis has catalyzed new business, new businesses opportunities for Uber and Dara, I think you've talked about this a little bit in the past, but you've got this network built up in the extent of expanding it beyond Eats into more, you know, packages and you're doing it for essential services, but are there other commercial opportunities, and is this the catalyst that breaks out that opportunity for you? Thank you very much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, Mark. I think in these times of crisis, you have to keep things simple. We have an incredible opportunity. It's not a new opportunity, but it just got a lot bigger, and it's called eats. And we have Rides, which is the only global player, number one, and basically everywhere that we operate with margin. So, we're going to focus on that core, because that core is really, really strong. And we think those two together can work incredibly well. There is a really interesting opportunity for Uber Eats business, to get into grocery, both organically and with our acquisition of Cornershop. And then with both Rides and Eats, we are going to absolutely work on package delivery because we just think it's going to be a much bigger part of retail and general going forward, and we can play our part. So, the good news is that the growth opportunity is in the core, and we already have global scale in the core, and we have great business leaders, great technical leaders in that core as well. And we're going to focus on that right now. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thank you Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. I just wanted to just get an update on some of the kind of [clavis markets] and any progress you made pre-COVID? And then, you know, is there any change in how you think about those markets coming out of COVID that you can give us an update on? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, we were making strong progress on the [clavis markets]. You know, Germany was a great highlight, and very growing at triple digits essentially, pre-COVID. Argentina was a very promising market for us that was growing quickly. I\u2019d say that our Clavis markets in general, were growing about 70% on a pre-COVID basis. There is no reason to think that structurally post-COVID anything is going to change. I think Germany has done a great job of opening up their markets, so to speak. And as these markets open up, we're going to open up with them, and we're going to do so in a safe way. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay, thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Youssef Squali with SunTrust. Nate Mitchell : Great, thank you. This is Nate Mitchell on for Youssef. Dara, you\u2019ve alluded to this in some of your remarks, but curious if you could comment, maybe more specifically, on how this new environment changes your positioning with the TFL? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, we don't think that there's going to be a significant change with the TFL. We're going to have our day in court. We're confident of the changes that we made to the service. We think that we are setting a bar for safety. We have been setting a bar for safety and I think we're improving on our own bar for safety, and now with COVID, we're going to keep upping the ante so to speak in terms of safety. We have a great partnership with National Health Service to help, while people are in need of help. It's tough to tell as to whether COVID is going to delay things one way or the other, but I don't think it substantially changes the relationship, and we are confident of our position and you know, I think that we'll see, we'll have our day in court and we like our chances. Next question. Operator : Thank you. We have a question from John Blackledge with Cowen. John Blackledge : Great, thanks. Yeah. Two questions on Eats. Do you think the level of growth in April is sustainable as we round through the year, potentially given people's concerns about eating out and despite a looming macro environment? And then on grocery, you know with the pandemic, online grocery demand has seemingly been pulled forward a couple of years, as you alluded to Dara, how are you going to address grocery delivery in the U.S.? You know just given existing platforms and deals they have with large grocers. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. So, in terms of the Eats growth and is a sustainable, listen it's very difficult to predict what's happening in these markets. It certainly does seem to be sustainable over this period. If anything that trends with Eats are getting better and the trends that we described in April were trends during periods in which some big European markets in terms of restaurants etcetera were closed. So, we're optimistic of trends in the category. And we think that the capability of the team is only improving as well. We're very happy with the execution that we see. So, did the category just get much bigger? Yes. Did millions of millions of new customers essentially try out the category? Yes. And are we in a superior position to be one of those services that they try and then continue to engage with? Yes. So, I think we're in a great position, but I think it'd be foolish to try to predict, you know, particulars in terms of growth rates. We are optimistic as it relates to Eats. In general on the grocery side, Cornershop is, you know, our big play there. We've an asset acquisition. Cornershop is quite focused in Latin America; you know that we have a very big rides business in Latin America. So, Latin America is can be, not only a big market, but also high margin market as well. And I think in the U.S. right now just the category is so big that we think that there's going to be room for more than one player. And we have, you know, very big scale in terms of audience. We're in many of these cities already. So, we just have the infrastructure to be able to get started in these cities that we choose to get started in the cities in a very low cost way versus someone kind of starting up in the category. We saw kind of very, very strong early signs from grocery just with essentials. And I do think it's something that can scale and we can be one of the scale players, but we're going to do so in a careful way. We're not going to buy our way into share. We're going to earn our way. And I think we're in a pretty good position to earn our way. John Blackledge : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Operator, can we have one more question, please? Operator : Yes, sir. We have a question from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Brian Fitzgerald : Thanks, guys. So, my question is around this, to what degree are you seeing franchises allocate national advertising budget and spend to yourselves in the food delivery industry as a means to, to advertise shifting budgets supporting the medium in the industry. You know, case in point, for context, McDonald's requires, I think, 4% or 5% of gross sales to be spent on advertising. So that is something that I think would subsidize you guys and support you guys. So, that's my question. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. Brian, it's a good question. I think in general, the category \u2013 it makes a lot of sense. I mean, the national players are smart. They're incredible marketers. I mean, they built these incredible brands, and you can expect them to allocate brand to where the growth is. So, I would absolutely not be surprised to see a McDonald's Chipotle or other national brands, focus their advertising more on delivery. I don't think it's a hard sell right now. And I think that it's going to benefit them. And it's going to benefit the category as well. I do think that for us advertising in general, on Eats, especially, is a pretty interesting category. When I was in the olden days, when I was running Expedia, advertising and travel turned out to be a very fast growing category that was incredibly high margin. You've seen leading players like Amazon that have built product search, and then build advertising on top of product search as well. And I think that we've got the same opportunity with Eats. So when we talk about the revenue margin opportunity for Eats, that's really a revenue margin opportunity for the pure play, and we think that there's an advertising opportunity with Eats as well, just as you see MCAPs and supermarkets. You know, you could see MCAPs in the Eats feed, for example. So it's early, but we have seen this play run before. And we have an excellent engineering team who can build pretty fast. And we're quite optimistic as far as the advertising opportunity inside of the Eats product, and then eventually it might go to the Rides products as well. So, with that, I think that's it. I would like to thank everyone for joining us. This is an extraordinary time. So, we appreciate the time. And again, I do want to thank everyone at Uber, all the employees. I think this has been a very, very tough time, but I think that we as a company have risen to the occasion. There's a lot of hard work ahead of us, but I know that as a company, we're more than up for it. So, thank you very much for joining. We'll talk to you next quarter and stay safe.

Following prepared remarks today, we will open the call for questions. The remainder of the discussion, all growth rates reflects year-over-year growth unless otherwise noted. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Emily, and apologies to everyone about the technical difficulties to start with. On our last earnings call in May, I said that we were planning for a nonlinear recovery that vary geographically, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve got, particularly across the U.S. where the reopening has been uneven at best. And while we would have all hoped that by now, we have a clear line of sight to the end of the pandemic, hope is not a strategy, and it\u2019s my job to ensure that Uber is well prepared for any scenario. Before I get into details on our Q2 results, I want to recap some of the actions that we\u2019ve taken so far and the trends that we\u2019re seeing today. In the early days of the crisis, we moved at Uber speed to stabilize our mobility business and to capitalize on the enormous tailwinds behind delivery. More than two-thirds of our cost of revenue and OpEx, excluding stock-based comp, are not fixed. So simply, if the trip doesn\u2019t happen, most of the costs don\u2019t. That variable cost structure, coupled with a tough decision on headcount, meant that our mobility segment still generated $50 million in positive adjusted EBITDA profit in the quarter despite a 73% year-on-year drop in gross bookings. Meanwhile, our delivery segment saw massive acceleration, growing gross bookings 122% year-on-year, excluding exited markets, while improving margins 59 percentage points. It\u2019s become clear that we have a hugely valuable hedge across our two core segments. There\u2019s a critical advantage in any recovery scenario. When travel restrictions lift, you know that mobility trips rebound. If restrictions continue or need to be reimposed, our delivery business will compensate. And as a scaled global player, we get the recovery whenever and wherever it happens, even if some cities and countries lag behind others. We\u2019ve leveraged these two factors to grow total company gross bookings at constant currency from the Q2 bottom of negative 45% year-on-year to about minus 12% in the month of July, driven by mobility being down 53% year-on-year and delivery up 134% year-on-year. The bottom line is that we\u2019ve taken swift action on everything that\u2019s within our control, cutting more than $1 billion in annual fixed cost versus our Q4 plan, rapidly deploying new mobility products to meet changing needs and expanding delivery beyond food. We did this while innovating in safety to ensure that our core rides experience is ready for our customer\u2019s second trip. And as a side note, please, please, please wear a mask. Regardless of the ultimate shape of the recovery curve, I\u2019m confident that the work we\u2019ve done is ensure that we\u2019re well positioned. Our actions have strengthened our foundation, brought renewed focus and energy to our core business and have seen us operating and innovating more effectively than ever before. Now a bit more on the delivery business. At a roughly $30 billion annual gross bookings run rate at the end of Q2, our delivery business alone is now as big as our Rides business was when I joined the company in 2017. We\u2019ve essentially built a second Uber in under three years, with an accelerating growth profile, a global footprint and an enormous TAM. And while some of the recent surge in delivery due to COVID, I believe we\u2019re witnessing a much more profound shift in consumer behavior that will last well beyond the pandemic. Consumers are quickly becoming accustomed to the magic of having anything delivered to their door in half an hour, much like the magic of having a car show up in a few minutes. This is an opportunity that will be many times larger than even we expected and one that Uber is uniquely positioned to lead. We\u2019ve turned our natural advantages and a disciplined capital allocation framework into the number one or number two competitive position in the vast majority of our country. In the U.S., year-on-year GV growth accelerated to over 110%, with order volumes growing over 80% in nearly 100 million orders in Q2. We now have a strong position in a majority of the top 10 U.S. markets representing nearly half of the category\u2019s bookings. And I\u2019m happy to report that we made significant gains in New York City, with gross bookings growing 120% year-on-year in Q2 and 150% year-on-year in June. We\u2019re now number one in the outer boroughs, and we continue to narrow the gap in the end. In July, we announced our intention to acquire Postmates, which achieved a $4 billion annualized gross bookings run rate in Q2. We believe this acquisition will continue to bolster a relatively smaller position in important cities like Los Angeles and across the U.S. Southwest and offer greater restaurant selection while increasing order density, improving delivery efficiency and reducing costs. Non-U.S. bookings account for 55% of delivery volumes. We\u2019re now in the number one position in a number of strategic high-spend markets, which account for over two-thirds of our international bookings, including Australia, Canada, France, Japan and Mexico. In many other key markets, we have secured a number one position in larger anchor cities such as London and Taipei, from which we can expand nationally. This strategy allows us to gain competitive share while improving margins. We\u2019re now adjusted EBITDA profitable in two of our top five international GV markets and expect to make meaningful progress towards profitability, not only country-by-country but for our entire delivery portfolio. In many of our international markets, much of our competition continues to come from aggregator incumbents who either don\u2019t want to enter the logistics of delivery or struggling to do so. By contrast, we offer restaurants the best of both worlds, using our couriers or use these couriers whenever demand outstrips your in-house delivery capacity, as has increasingly been the case during [indiscernible]. In many markets, we\u2019ve seen that restaurants with their own couriers actually end up calling Uber Eats couriers about 30% of the time, demonstrating the unique advantages that we bring and one that we believe will hasten the shift towards a delivery model. Using our existing network, we\u2019re moving quickly into new delivery as a service offering, which we see as a very high-potential opportunity. We piloted partnerships delivering home goods, pet supplies and pharmacy items. In other novel uses of our networks, our Uber Connect option lets consumers send small packages to friends and family via UberX drivers, a huge hit with Latin America with three million trips globally since early June. And just last month, following promising launches in Europe and Australia, we\u2019ve expanded grocery to the U.S. this time in partnership with Cornershop. Cornershop has seen incredible traction in Latin America, and we\u2019re excited to bring a strong product and execution in the U.S. The COVID crisis has moved food delivery from a luxury to utility. And as we add more use cases, our service will move from a utility to daily need. As such, we\u2019re ramping up our subscription efforts, including nationwide allotments of Eats Pass, which combines free food and grocery delivery; and eventually, Uber Pass, which combines both Rides and Eats benefits in one monthly package. All of these activities has resulted in new customer acquisition, monthly active eaters, orders per eater, basket size and eater retention, all being up year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter, both globally, ex India, and in the U.S. This translates into something simple : more loyal and delighted eaters across the globe. Finally, shifting to our mobility business, which I would describe as a tale of 10,000 cities. Our mobility recovery is clearly dependent on the public health situation in any given area. Asia, ex India is in the recovery lead. We\u2019ve seen gross bookings of Hong Kong and New Zealand at times exceed pre-COVID highs. European trends have also been encouraging. France, Spain and Germany, amongst others, have improved to being down 35% or less year-over-year recently. The U.S. is lagging. The GV is down around 50% to 85% in our top markets, with cities like New York leading in the recovery and some West Coast cities like San Francisco and L.A. grow further behind. Our global geographic footprint remains a huge advantage, and we\u2019re seeing evidence that confirms what we\u2019ve always believed, that when cities move again, so does Uber. We\u2019d observed that workday commute trips bounce back sharply after lockdowns lift, but it\u2019s not clear that weekend and social hour use cases return quickly, too, confirming the critical role Uber plays in people\u2019s lives. I\u2019m also proud of the speed in which we reacted to extraordinary circumstances. Our long-standing focus on safety, let us lead the industry with our door-to-door safety standards, a combination of new technology like mass detection, shared responsibility through enforcement of our community guidelines, education from health experts and a partnership with leading brands like Clorox, eVTOL and Unilever. And thanks to our global scale, we\u2019ve been able to purchase 13 million masks and other hygiene supplies for drivers with more to come. Our global scope not only provides diversification during uncertain times. It also allows us to lean in and invest more in technical innovation than our competitors. We recently focused on three areas. First, we built new products for new use cases : our hourly option lets you book one car for several hours so that you can run errands without having to request the trip at each stop along the way; and our Uber for business team has built a new shared ride solution, which matches only employees from the same company. Look us up if you want to get back to work safely and affordably with your coworkers. Second, we\u2019re doubling down on adding new vehicle types like taxis. We\u2019ve see that taxi drivers have increased their time on Uber about 25% during the pandemic, and we believe we can help them find new sources of demand. We reached a big milestone with our taxi launch in Tokyo, and yesterday\u2019s acquisition of Autocab in the UK will deepen our taxi offering. We\u2019re also adding auto rickshas and motor bikes since we expect many riders in emerging markets to shift from public mini buses towards these lower-cost options. Third, we\u2019re becoming a key partner for transit agencies to help them deliver more efficient, accessible and equitable service. In June, we announced the first ever software deal to power on-demand transit in Marin County in California, and our acquisition of Routematch brings together Uber\u2019s expertise in on-demand mobility with Routematch\u2019s proven capabilities in the space. In sum, we\u2019re the global leader in ridesharing. We\u2019ve leveraged our brand, our platform and our technical capabilities to organically build a food delivery business as big as ridesharing. We\u2019re now leveraging ridesharing to expand into every mobility category, and we\u2019re leveraging food delivery to build a real-time logistics engine for all local commerce at Uber scale. And we\u2019re doing it right now in your city and across the globe. Now I\u2019ll bring Nelson for some more details on the numbers. Nelson Chai : Thanks, Dara. Thanks, Dara. I\u2019m very pleased with our execution in an evolving environment. We continue to achieve adjusted EBITDA profitability in our mobility business, quickly grew and improved our delivery business margins, significantly tightened our cost structure and increased our focus on our core businesses. And coupled with our strong cash position, we are well positioned to withstand continued uncertainty while driving towards our stated profitability target. I will now discuss key operational metrics as well as non-GAAP financial measures. All comparisons are year-over-year and on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. Year-over-year comparisons for total company, mobility and delivery adjusted net revenue exclude the impact of our Q2 2019 driver appreciation award associated with our IPO. Total company gross bookings declined 32%. Adjusted net revenue, or ANR, was $1.9 billion, down 37%, and our ANR take rate was 18.8% of gross bookings, up 53 basis points. Excluding the driver appreciation award, our take rate was down 140 basis points as delivery, which has a lower take rate, became a larger part of the business. Non-GAAP cost of revenues, excluding D&A, decreased to 46% from 51% of ANR. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes in our mobility business, resulting in a decrease in insurance and payment costs. Turning now to non-GAAP operating expenses, which include pro forma adjustments such as stock-based compensation and restructuring charges, operations and support increased year-over-year to 19% from 16% of adjusted net revenue, however, was down $89 million on an absolute dollar basis, reflecting mitigating actions taken in the second quarter, offsetting loss of leverage on the top line. Sales and marketing increased to 36% from 34% of adjusted net revenue but was down $284 million, which you saw lower marketing and promotion spend in our mobility business. R&D increased to 22% from 16% of ANR and was down $33 million, primarily driven by a decrease in people spend. And G&A increased to 22% from 15% of ANR and was down $9 million from a year ago. Quarter-over-quarter, our spend decreased $148 million but increased as a percentage of ANR due to top line pressure from COVID. Our Q2 2020 total adjusted EBITDA loss was $837million. Now I\u2019ll provide additional detail on our segments. Starting with mobility. Mobility gross bookings of $3 billion declined 73% and ANR of $793 million declined 68%, while take rate of 26% improved both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to rationalization of incentive spend. Despite a significant headwind to our top line performance, mobility adjusted EBITDA was $50 million or 6.3% of mobility ANR. Now on to delivery. We capitalized on the tailwinds related to stay-at-home orders, driving delivery gross bookings to $7 billion, up 113% or 122%, ex India and other markets that we have exited. Delivery ANR of $885 million was up 163% due to mix shift towards small and medium-sized restaurants, driving higher basket sizes, coupled with courier payment efficiencies, mainly in the U.S. Delivery ANR take rate was 12.7%, up 240 basis points year-over-year and up 140 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to overall improvement in basket sizes and rationalization of incentive spend. Additionally, we realize the benefit from exiting India earlier this year and are seeing an additional 80 basis points benefit from business model changes in some countries that reclassify certain payments and incentives as cost of revenue. Delivery adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $232 million or negative 26.2% of ANR. That represents an $81 million and 33% quarter-over-quarter improvement, respectively. On to freight, which grew ANR to $211 million, and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $49 million. We are pleased with the progress in our freight business as we continue to invest in technology to drive efficiency in the logistics industry. Through recent partnerships with Oracle and Bluejay, our real-time pricing and booking API is now integrated into all major TMS providers, allowing shippers to create a more resilient supply chain in response to COVID and generating 200% quarter-over-quarter API revenue growth. Our machine learning algorithms enable more loads to be booked by carriers as bundles, reducing MP miles and improving utilization. On to ATG and other technology programs. The adjusted EBITDA loss for the quarter was $91 million. Following a brief period of simulation-only development, we are pleased that Uber ATG, restarted test track and public road operations for its self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh this quarter after implementing a series of measures consistent with expert guidance to help mitigate the risk of spread of COVID-19. Finally, other bets. This segment consisted primarily of Jump, which we divested to Lime in May. Lime is now available through the Uber app in 50 cities, and Lime recently won operating permits in key cities like Paris, Chicago and Denver. After winding down our Jump operations this quarter, we are no longer reporting this segment. In Q2 2020, corporate G&A and platform R&D of $490 million, which represents the G&A and R&D not allocated to one of our segments, decreased 21% due primarily to the layoffs we announced in May as well as lower accrued taxes associated with the decline in mobility. As mobility rebounds in Q3, we expect to see some absolute dollars grow modestly quarter-on-quarter. In terms of liquidity, we ended the quarter with approximately $7.8 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, and that is over $2 billion from our revolver, providing us with ample liquidity to withstand the recovery of. Given the unique circumstances affecting our business in Q2, I\u2019ll provide a few context around our expectations for Q3 performance. We expect a mobility ANR take rate of 22% to 24%. As mobility recovers from the low of Q2, we are back to strategically investing in the business, including some incentives as drivers return to the platform. Where we land within this range will largely depend on the slope of the recovery in the U.S. relative to the rest of the world and the resulting business mix. Given delivery\u2019s large margin improvement quarter-over-quarter, we expect Eats adjusted EBITDA absolute dollar losses in Q3 to be in line with Q2. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins to continue to improve in Q4. We expect stock-based compensation in each of Q3 and Q4 to be $200 million to $250 million after a decline in Q2 due to May\u2019s reductions in force. All in all, despite the headwinds that COVID-19 has created for our business, we have a mobility business that still achieved profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis despite being down significantly in the quarter. We have a delivery business that is quickly improving on all respects, both on the top line and on an adjusted EBITDA margin basis. We took decisive action on costs across the entire company, removing over $1 billion in annualized costs, including reducing the corporate G&A and platform R&D by over $150 million quarter-over-quarter, and we have a strong balance sheet to weather a bumpy recovery. All this taken together gives us continued confidence in our ability to achieve quarterly adjusted EBITDA profitability sometime in 2021. And with that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : Hey guys. Just a question on the food business. So I think there\u2019s been a lot of debate in the industry as to whether or not pure-play delivery companies like yours can turn a profit, and thanks for the additional details in those slides. Looks like that\u2019s happening in France and Belgium, but not yet anywhere else. So I guess, what are you doing in those two markets that is allowing for that profitability curve to move up? And where do we stand on that curve in the U.S.? And Nelson, you said it\u2019s going to be improved in 4Q. So what \u2013 just from a timing perspective, when should we expect the food side of the business to get to that breakeven? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, Ross. As far as the debate goes, we stand firmly on the belief that pure-play delivery companies can and will be profitable. And we think it\u2019s a pretty easy answer, but we don\u2019t think that debate is worthwhile, so to speak. It\u2019s only a question of when and it\u2019s only a question of what those long-term margins will be. We have laid out a long-term margin profile of 15% of ANR and about 33% of EBITDA. We wouldn\u2019t be doing it unless we felt confident there. To be clear, Belgium is actually one of our smaller countries internationally, and we had said that we\u2019re profitable in two of our top five international countries. And there are a number of other countries that we are also profitable in, but we also wanted to make the point with investors that we\u2019re profitable in countries that count. So it\u2019s not just France and Belgium. It\u2019s other countries. And listen, I think as far as what we\u2019re doing, it\u2019s a combination of factors. The revenue margins are healthy. You\u2019ve got a business that is either in CP 1 or CP 2 so that you can get real liquidity and \u2013 on the delivery side in the marketplaces and can bring cost per transaction down. And in many of those markets, we have a very big eater base so that we don\u2019t need to lean into new eater acquisition as a percentage of our overall eater base quite as much as in Japan that\u2019s growing at 300%, 400%, where just \u2013 we\u2019ve got less than 5% of restaurants signed up, where you\u2019re really leading into new eaters and new restaurants as well. But when we look from a structural basis or the margins of the business, you fast forward a couple of years now, we think we will be profitable in the vast majority of the countries in which we operate. If we\u2019re not profitable, it\u2019s specifically because we\u2019re trying to achieve something strategically, whether it\u2019s a growth target or we\u2019re trying to expand the number of categories that we\u2019re in, et cetera. So we land firmly on one side of the debate, and we have a lot of data internally and very high confidence in the teams to win that debate. Can you get my question? Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. First, the parts of the world where Rides has begun to recover, curious if you could give us any granularity on whether the marketing efficiencies are coming through in the business. In this case, maybe the incremental ride is more profitable than it was in a pre-COVID world, either due to competitive intensity or some of the changes you\u2019ve made in the business. And then the function of the world where you have the Eats asset and the Rides business, how have some of the cross-marketing efforts gone to bring people into the Eats side of the portfolio and generate a higher LTV of those users? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Hi, Eric. You can\u2019t generalize \u2013 every single market is different and unique based on the competitive factors. That said, the actions that we took in end of Q1, Q2 on the cost side, we believe, have structurally improved the profitability of our mobility business. So all things being equal, we talked about in January for the first two months, our mobility business had a 30% plus EBITDA margin. Those \u2013 during those months, the mobility business would actually deliver a higher EBITDA margin evenly at 30%. But when we look at the competitive landscape, every single country is different. There are some countries where we\u2019re leaning into improved driver supply. There are some countries where some competitors are leaning in as well. But I \u2013 but generally, when we look at our profit profile coming out of the crisis, we see it as constructive overall as it relates to the whole portfolio. As far as the cross-marketing with \u2013 has gone, as I think the story of it tells the tale, which is we\u2019ve basically taken this business from single-digit billion to $30 billion run rate. It\u2019s all been organic. I think it has been on top of the mobility platform that we\u2019ve had. It\u2019s a technical platform. It\u2019s an operations platform, and it\u2019s also a brand that we\u2019ve built off of. We did mention in the last quarter that we have seen increasing cost dispatch rate between our Rides driver, so to speak, who are moving over to delivering for Eats. We especially see that in markets that have more of a suburban profile. And those cross-dispatch percentages remain elevated. Although as we see the mobility business come back, kind of you\u2019re seeing more of our drivers coming back and driving just on mobility. So, the cross-dispatch is the magic on the supply side. And then on the demand side, new eater acquisition remains very healthy. The number of eaters that we have per month remains healthy, and LTV is increasing actually pretty significantly, because basket sizes are up. Number of orders per eater are up and retention rates are up. So, when you put the combination of all three of those, higher basket size, higher retention, higher number of order per eater, then you\u2019ve seen our revenue margins come up. Actually, all four of those factors point to a much, much significantly increased LTV on an eater basis. So like every single one of those trends is healthy, and we haven\u2019t seen any signs of slackening or weakening on any of those trends. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question? Can we get our next question? Operator : And Brian Nowak [Morgan Stanley], your line is open. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Dara, on delivery as a service sort of moving beyond eats and people. Curious to hear about some of the \u2013 one or two of the key strategic steps in investments that you think of being the most important to overcome that you think are really going to help determine the timing of that business scaling and sort of your timing of when you can really realize that opportunity of delivery as a service. And then the second one on Eats just so we can sort of understand the underlying health of this business. Any help on how fast the number of eaters or delivery map \u2013 is growing right now? And how do we think about Eats bookings trends into the third quarter? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, Brian. As far as the kind of the strategic pillars that we need in order to expand into adjacent categories, it really is about supply and demand. So, on the supply side now, we have over 10,000 partners, who have partnered up with us. These are grocery stores, marketplaces, essential stores, et cetera. You first have to establish the supply into the marketplace. And frankly, with the environment being what it is, with home delivery just becoming an everyday use case for every single category, we\u2019re having \u2013 we\u2019re not having a problem building out the supply on a local basis. But once you build up the supply, then you\u2019ve got to build up the demand, and that\u2019s really where consumer habits come into play. And consumer habits are actually difficult to change. So, we are merchandising these new categories on the app in different ways. We have actually pretty useful experience on the mobility app, where we have been upselling what we call R2E riders to eaters. So, we are having some experiences to how do you introduce a new product to an audience without cannibalizing that audience. We\u2019ve been doing it for more than a year on the Ride to Eats side. So, we\u2019re going to use the same exact experience on the Eats app in order to introduce eaters into the new categories. So you might see some services that allow you to take grocery as a separate category. You\u2019ll see grocery appearing as a new category on the Rides app. You\u2019ll also see essentials, et cetera, show up in the flow essentially as someone searches for food in their neighborhood on the app. So there are multiple, multiple ways in which we\u2019re starting to introduce this new category in order to make sure that an eater who comes to Eats finds the food that he or she is looking for, but also realize, \u201cOh, wow, look. I can get a pharmacy. I can get grocery. I can get everyday essentials in 30, 40 minutes with this app\u201d. And it\u2019s a very differentiated use case from what\u2019s available elsewhere. It will take time, but I think you\u2019ve seen the evidence of our moving from Rides to Eats, building this big Eats business. We\u2019re going to use the same exact learning to build the adjacent categories. Now, we\u2019re also acquiring the majority of Cornershop, which has been grocery \u2013 which has been focused purely on grocery, has a great entrepreneurial team, has built a great business in Latin America, moving over all of those learnings, because they\u2019re unique learnings in terms of taking and packing, et cetera, getting a team that solely focused on groceries. So you already have a best-of-breed solution and then introducing that best-of-breed solution to the millions of riders and eaters that we\u2019d have is a great shortcut that was made possible as part of that acquisition. Nelson, do you want to answer the second question as far as growth trends? Nelson Chai : Yes. Sure. So, in terms of the growth trend, our maps are up 70% in the second quarter year-over-year, accelerating in July. The new eaters in the second quarter were up over 50%. We\u2019re seeing double-digit increases in basket size. And if you think about stay-at-home orders, we are \u2013 one of the reasons that\u2019s driving our take rate improvement is just higher basket sizes. And so we are seeing good trends and seeing good trends even in July. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Next question please? Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. I want to ask about the Rides use cases and the recovery that you\u2019re seeing in those. I saw that slide you had about workday commute, social airport in Hong Kong, New Zealand and other markets. You think that\u2019s generally representative of what you could see? And I guess I want to \u2013 what I\u2019m trying to get at is as we go through kind of a structural change in work from home, there\u2019s the possibility that we will just have fewer work commutes structurally going forward. But so just comment on that \u2013 addressing that risk. That part of your business is just going to be structurally under pressure for the next couple of years as we just commute less. And then what data you\u2019ve seen so far that either supports or refutes that suggest that commute rides can come back quickly. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, Mark. We\u2019ve been desperately looking for trends to identify ways in which the future would be different from the past, and frankly, we haven\u2019t come up with any. So workday is back. Workday commute is back. Workday commute in a couple of these markets, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Sweden is already \u2013 was already at certain points above kind of pre-COVID highs. So while the hypothesis of stay-at-home is a strong one, it\u2019s especially strong in tech corridors. The reality that we\u2019re seeing is that as cities open up, then people get back to work, and that\u2019s the only pattern that we can discern at this point. We talked about travel continuing to be weak, although even travel in France, airport trips are looking like they\u2019re bouncing back. We\u2019ll be watching this closely. Obviously, it\u2019ll be very interesting for us to see if people aren\u2019t going to commute as much as they did in the past. My belief, is that if they move from a big city to a smaller city, well, we\u2019re going to expand into the smaller cities. And if they don\u2019t go to work, people will kind of get out of their house, and Uber is going to be a consistent utility, a consistent way of folks to have access to mobility without having to pay thousands of dollars for a car and will be kind of an increasing and improving use case in people\u2019s lives. It may change the exact use cases by place, but we haven\u2019t seen any signs now that there would be any kind of permanent damage to the business. I\u2019d say, on the contrary, based on some markets that have come back and have opened up, we\u2019ve seen the business bounce right back. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks a lot. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : I guess, Nelson, maybe you could help us understand the difference between the profitable delivery markets and the overall business, with margins down 26%. What are the big differences competitively? Or is it just maturity of the markets? And then second, maybe you could give us, California \u2013 this is maybe for Dara, AB5 legislation, a court update, and kind of how you\u2019re thinking about the ballot initiative rollout and advertising and how you think that rolls out here over the next three months. Thank you. Nelson Chai : Justin, I\u2019ll start and Dara will take the second question. Really, we\u2019ve seen improvement across the overall delivery space, and you heard it in our upfront comments, and you see it in the press release. And if you think about what are the markets that are doing quite well, we have a very strong market position. It\u2019s a market that does have a very high propensity of 3P business, and the take rates are strong. And it\u2019s really that straightforward. And we\u2019re doing a better job in terms of operating the business and getting better efficiency. And so we are seeing that play out, and we\u2019re even hearing in India, which you know in past calls we would call out because of how challenging it is. Even in a market like India today, the unit economics are improving as we see through our investment in Zomato. So I think what you\u2019re seeing right now, at least in this COVID world, is the margins are improving. There\u2019s more reliance. There\u2019s more stay at home. There\u2019s more small businesses, and it really is driving better unit economics because of the basket sizes improving the take rates. And again, we believe that as we continue to do it, we will lean into certain marketplaces. We try to grow and take advantage of the growth, and you\u2019re seeing the tremendous growth we\u2019re having. But we are confident in terms of our profitability path in this business over the next couple of years. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then as far as AB5 Prop 22, listen, I think the point of Prop 22 for us is that we do think that there\u2019s a better way. The vast majority of drivers who drive either on our platform or on Lyft or couriers, et cetera, do so on a part-time basis, do not want to be employees and value the flexibility that they get using our platforms. And what we\u2019ve offered with Prop 22, we think, is the best of both worlds, which is the flexibility that the vast majority of drivers want who use platforms like ours, along with protection \u2013 social protections, wage protection, health care, et cetera, which we think now is an expectation of society, and it\u2019s completely appropriate to this new way of working. So, when we look at Prop 22, it makes all the sense in the world. It is actually what drivers want. We\u2019ve got more than 75,000 drivers that are already supporting the campaign. And again, on a 4 :1 margin, drivers prefer to remain independent, so we think it makes all the sense in the world. Now the ballot initiative is moving. We think we\u2019ve got a great message. We\u2019ve got terrific supporters in the community as well who actually care about drivers versus labor unions and politics. They actually are taking into account the wants and needs of drivers and safety \u2013 ridership safety, prices, availability, of mobility to a wide swath of the cities. And we think it\u2019s a better position, and we\u2019re confident in our position as far as the ballot campaign goes. In the courts, obviously, it\u2019s going to be up to the judiciary to determine whether AB5 applies to us. We have made significant changes to our business models. Riders pay drivers directly. Drivers have a full understanding of the ride before they make a decision to accept a ride or not accept the ride. Drivers can set their own price. We even have a product, a subscription product of drivers, where they can buy a subscription from us and secure a number of leads. And essentially, that driver then secures leads and get 100% of the payment of any ride that they provide, and they can accept rides or not accept rides. It\u2019s completely up to them. We\u2019re essentially out of the transaction. We\u2019re a subscriber \u2013 or a subscription provider leads to those drivers. So we think we\u2019ve got a great road as it relates to Prop 22. And we also think that we have a very strong position, which is based on fact and based on how we\u2019ve changed our product in the courts as well. And time will tell whether or not the legislature or the voters and the courts agree with our position. Justin Post : Great, thank you. Maybe, one follow-up, on the California market share situation, has some of the changes \u2013 and I know we talked about it in the last call, impacted maybe U.S. market share in the last quarter? Dara Khosrowshahi : We think that some of the changes were a headwind as it relates to our market share in California. For example, acceptance rates for drivers went down in certain circumstances that a driver didn\u2019t want to pick them on up or drop someone off at a certain area. So we do think that our category position in California did hurt as a result of the changes. Now volumes are down. So it didn\u2019t have a significant effect on our overall trip volume. When we look at our category position on a nationwide basis in the U.S., it\u2019s pretty flat since January. No significant change. Justin Post : Great, thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Richard Kramer with Arete Research. Richard Kramer : Arete Research, thank you very much. A couple of questions, First of all, can you give us a sense of your outlook for the competitive environment in the U.S. market as you bring Postmates on board and ramp up new services, but also seeing competitors that may have quite a bit of capital to deploy in aggressive incentives in the states? And I\u2019m just curious about your comment about resuming incentives in Rides. And how do you see the incentive environment in the U.S. playing out over the next few years? And then I\u2019ll have a follow-up after that. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Hi, Richard. I\u2019ll start with Rides, and I\u2019ll finish on delivery. Listen, I think on the rides market, what we\u2019ve seen \u2013 the pattern that we\u2019ve seen and as it relates to the competitive environment is ourselves, our largest competitor, has transitioned from focusing on incentives to buy or establish share or category position to focusing on service and focusing on brand and focusing on technology to establish category position. We think that\u2019s healthy competition, and we like our position as it relates to brand and service and what kind of service our technology can deliver. I don\u2019t expect it to change. I do think that in the early parts of the recovery in the U.S. we are seeing less drivers on balance come back onto the platform than elsewhere in the world. That could have something to do with unemployment checks. So, we will be putting some incentives into the market. Nelson talked about revenue margin trends in Q3 versus Q2 in the mobility segment. That\u2019s because we intend to lean in a little bit to make sure that we have kind of the right kind of liquidity in the U.S. market. Outside of the U.S. competitive position again, there are certain flare-ups, but we\u2019re very confident. And overall, you see our mobility profitability in Q1. Even in a very tough quarter, we think our profitably profile will improve in Q2, Q3, Q4. We don\u2019t see \u2013 Q3, Q4. We don\u2019t see any change there. As far as the delivery segment goes, look, the U.S. is a very competitive market. Obviously, you\u2019ve got DoorDash, you\u2019ve got Grubhub, but then you\u2019ve got Amazon in the marketplace. You\u2019ve got grocery players, et cetera. This is a broad market. We don\u2019t define it as just food. As I said in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re really thinking about overall local commerce, and we see lots of competition. But also, we see a very large category, a historic kind of demand wave behind us. And we think within a competitive environment, we can have constructive margin profiles going forward. Richard Kramer : Okay, thanks. And then just a quick follow-up on that, I mean just looking at excess driver incentives, they went up a bit this quarter, and even though obviously, you had a very strong revenue growth. Can you give us a reflection of the way you\u2019re thinking about excess driver incentive for low-value local deliveries and balancing that with the ability to match those deliveries and still have them available in a short time frame? Apologies for the dog barking in the background. Dara Khosrowshahi : No worries. Nelson, do you want to talk to that? Nelson Chai : Yes, sure. So look, I think that, as you know, you saw from the top line that our top line grew tremendous, and you saw me go through the statistics before. So, it\u2019s not surprising on an absolute basis you\u2019re going to see that number go up. We are doing a better job in terms of courier efficiency in other parts of the country. Some of them are a little bit business model changes. So there have been a few countries where we\u2019ve gone onshore and have seen the benefit of that in our courier efficiency. We will continue to focus on driving that and building the business. We don\u2019t manage the business for the next delivery. And we are trying to work with our tech teams to continue to allow us to batch more efficiently. But ultimately, we want to make sure we provide the best experience we can for the end users. So it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019ll see us continue to innovate, continue to work on it. It is an area that as we looked at Postmates, they\u2019re actually \u2013 they do a very, very good job of. It\u2019s something that \u2013 when we looked at what they were doing, it\u2019s something that we think they do very well. And so I think you\u2019ll see us continue to do a better job in terms of optimizing both batching and continuing to improve courier efficiency. Richard Kramer : Okay, thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : And Richard, sometimes when we see a significant dislocation in demand, and this is a dislocation that was positive when COVID happened, we saw huge spikes in demand in many, many markets. We just had difficulty catching up in terms of couriers available and the dependability of the network. So in those situations, sometimes we will take up incentives to make up for the dislocation. Then the marketplace tends to start to get into some kind of equilibrium, and then you can start taking incentives down. So, when we look at courier incentives, cost per transaction, now that we are more \u2013 now that we see more of an equilibrium, now that more restaurants are joining our service so that we can batch more, we see cost of courier kind of moving in a constructive direction. Richard Kramer : Okay. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Black with Evercore ISI. Benjamin Black : Great, thank you. You guys mentioned hitting profitability sometime in 2021. I\u2019m just curious to hear what do you need to see to get comfortable in actually calling a quarter? Is it faster cadence of the rise in recovery? Or is it narrowing losses on the EAP side? And then secondly, could you talk a little bit about your restaurant mix and how sticky have the SMB restaurants been on your platform during the recent reopening? And relatedly, how should we think about delivery revenue margins over the next couple of quarters? Thank you. Nelson Chai : Yes. I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll let Dara handle the back half of that question. So in terms of our path to profitability and our confidence, it is a number of different things. We believe we have enough things at our disposal. You saw us take the size of action in the second quarter. You saw us narrow our focus as a company in terms of our core businesses. At the end of the day, the single biggest driver of what quarter next year is really going to be on the COVID recovery and its impact on our mobility business. And so we have different scenarios out there depending on what outcome happens in terms of \u2013 does the market recover, but is it going to stay where it is today, which is roughly down 50. Does it actually start improving? Let\u2019s say, it\u2019s down 25%. Does it actually get that book down 10? Or does it actually get back to 2019? And depending on where that recovery comes, that will really dictate the timing of 2021. And so as we get a little bit more visibility, it seems like, particularly here in the U.S., things have only gotten murkier and not clear over the past few weeks here. But as that comes, we\u2019ll have a better view in terms of which quarter we think we\u2019ll get profitability. We are going to continue to build out and improve the economics of the delivery business. We will continue to invest in it, but we are going to continue to \u2013 the investment there. And then you saw us take the decisive cost actions. So again, we will get a better sense as we have a better sense on the COVID recovery. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. And as far as the restaurant stickiness, so we did see some restaurant churn in April, and frankly, that was because some restaurants went through incredibly \u2013 unfortunately, some of that went out of business or closed, essentially. Since then, when you look at May, June and July, we have seen restaurant retention rates that have been very, very high all around the world, really, a historical high. I think that we\u2019ve been just a much, much higher percentage of our restaurants business. You can see the dollars in gross bookings that we do in restaurants has gone up significantly on a year-on-year basis. We\u2019re introducing tools that restaurants can use, whether they want to launch their own site. We\u2019ve introduced kind of notifications for restaurant managers so that they can \u2013 if an order comes in that isn\u2019t accepted, et cetera, they know that there\u2019s more business out there for them. So the engagement that we have with our restaurants has gone up, and as a result, the stickiness of our services with our restaurant is really close to all-time highs, if not, at all-time times. Was there a third question that you asked? Benjamin Black : Yes. It was more along the lines of the revenue margin for the delivery business over the next couple of quarters just given the favorable mix and the shift to the restaurants. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I think that we don\u2019t want to say quarter-to-quarter, but you\u2019ve seen our take rates improve pretty consistently. We think that the take rate path is a positive path. So we see upside as it relates to our take rate. We talked about net revenue margin, long-term revenue margins of 50% for delivery business, and we\u2019re confident we can achieve those margins and potentially higher margins going forward. You should note that Q4 from a seasonality basis has \u2013 it\u2019s kind of pressurized on take rate. So, on a year-on-year basis, it will be kind of Q4-over-Q4. Year-on-year, the trends are going to be \u2013 should be positive. But from Q3 to Q4, there\u2019s usually some seasonality in Q4 as it relates to revenue margins. Benjamin Black : Excellent, very helpful. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You bet. Next question. Emily Reuter : Operator, can we take the last question, please? Hello, operator. Can we take the last question, please? Dara Khosrowshahi : It looks like we\u2019re missing the last question. All right, everyone. Thank you very much for joining us in Q2, it was a tough quarter. But I am just incredibly proud of how the teams executed. I think that we pivoted in a big way. We took some tough actions as it relates to costs. We said goodbye to some near and dear colleagues of ours, but we have secured the path forward. And while we can\u2019t predict the rate of recovery, we\u2019ve got a business that is just moving in an incredibly positive direction as it relates to delivery. And on the mobility side, we are seeing the bounce-back where countries are bouncing back. I think we\u2019ve proven to you again and again that we can deliver and that when cities open up, Uber opens up. And we\u2019re very hopeful of what we see going forward within the context of a very, very tough environment. There has been this kind of hopeful look forward. It\u2019s only possible because of incredibly hard work of our employees and the drivers and couriers, who are out there on the front line. So many, many thanks to everyone involved, and thank you, everyone, for joining. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

Following prepared remarks today, we will open the call to questions. For the remainder of this discussion, all growth rates reflect year-over-year growth and on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Emily. And thanks everyone for joining us today. It's hard to believe that it's been eight months since I first spoke with you about the coronavirus pandemic, without question, impact on the world has been one of the most significant events of our lifetimes and we move quickly as a company to respond. We've taken steps to prepare our mobility business for any recovery scenario, and to seize the vastly expanded opportunity ahead for delivery business, all while improving the overall health of a company, by taking out more than $1 billion in fixed costs, strengthening our balance sheet, and more rigorously allocating capital with a focus on our core segments. Despite the volatile environment, we steadily recovered gross bookings throughout the last few quarters with September run rate gross bookings reaching nearly $65 billion, down just 6% compared to last year. And despite the 50% decline in mobility gross bookings, we ended Q3 with total company adjusted EBITDA only 7% lower than last year, and we expect to improve adjusted EBITDA year-on-year in Q4. Whether consumers want to safely go somewhere safe in their city, or get something delivered to their door in 30 minutes, Uber is becoming their go to app. In September alone for 80 million people generated more than 425 million trips or deliveries across our platform. What I'm even more proud of, though, is that we connected 3.2 million drivers and delivery people to earnings opportunities and over 560,000 restaurants and small businesses to their customers during an unprecedented economic crisis. I'll now dive into each of our core segments, starting with mobility. Unsurprisingly, the mobility recovery continues to be directly correlated with the level of lockdown restrictions in any given city, when city start to move, so too does Uber. Mobility gross bookings continue to improve throughout the third quarter, nearly doubling from Q2 levels and down 50% year-on-year. We saw mobility GBs improve 10% month-on-month versus September to down 44% year-on-year. That's October mobility gross bookings. LATAM and APAC led the recovery, offset by slower gains in the US and Canada and a modest contraction in EMEA, driven by the new lockdown orders. The US has been an overall drag on our global recovery, as a point of comparison mobility GBs outside of the US were down 34% on October, verses down to 65% in the US. But we have some bright spots, even in the US. Just bringing the case count under control over the past few months, New York City has improved significantly, with bookings recovered to 63% of year ago levels in October. We're seeing Uber recovering faster than taxi and public transit in the city, indicating a deep level of consumer trust, we believe, stems from a safety technology investments and the reliability of our service. New York City rider engagement is up double digits year-on-year, but it's particularly up during non-peak hours, suggesting the emergence of new use cases. As of last week, while New York weekday commute and weekend gross bookings have recovered to roughly 85% of prior year levels, weekday gross bookings outside of commute hours have recovered to nearly 100% of prior year levels. Elsewhere, Brazil, our largest market on trips recovered to 87% on prior year levels in October. We're seeing workday commute, weekend use cases nearly fully recovered year-on-year, with airports, of course lagging. All early evidence we see makes it increasingly clear that it's a question of when, not if, our mobility business will recover. These trends, give us a confidence that mobility will fully recover, as public health situation improves and as people return to Uber to get to work, go shopping or reunite with their friends or family. Finally, it's important to note that we're continuing to invest in product innovation to drive growth. For existence, our taxi business grew nearly 20% year-on-year in Q3 and auto-rickshaws and motorbikes are recovering faster than the rest of our mobility segment. We're leading in and seeing strong momentum with Uber for business. Nearly 40% of our top 50 enterprise accounts are new since March, driven by increased demand for new products, including specialized compute offerings and guest products such as vouchers. Now, switching over to the Delivery business which is benefiting from a massive structural shift in the consumer behavior. As I've noted before, consumers are quickly becoming accustomed to the magic of having anything delivered to the door in half an hour, much like the magic of having a car show up in a few minutes. It's my belief that the tailwinds behind this category are so strong, that we can continue to deliver exceptional growth, while also improving profitability. In Q3, delivery gross bookings accelerated to 135% annual growth rate and reached $35 billion GB run rate. And adjusted net revenue nearly tripled year-on-year, expanding take rate to 13.3% and improving adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of ANR by more than 10 points quarter-on-quarter. This growth is coming, not only for an influx of new users, but also from higher engagement from existing users, with Delivery MAPC growth over 70% and trip growth over 110%, excluding markets that we exited, theatre, restaurant, delivery, driver retention, all increased year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. And we continue to add eaters at an elevated level. We did all of this with consistent improvement in the unit economy of this business and each quarter of this year. On the competitive front, we improved our category position in most major markets around the world, including GB - growing GBs at triple-digits year-on-year in several large markets, including the US, Canada, UK, France, Spain, Japan, Taiwan, amongst others. In the UK, we continued to expand our national footprint outwards from our leading position in London, delivering gross bookings growth of nearly 200%. On a trip basis, we're now only about 30% smaller than the reported numbers from Just Eat Takeaway. This compares to 60% smaller a year ago. While the US remains one of our most competitive markets globally, we made real progress in the quarter with GBs up roughly 123% year-on-year. We improved our position in 11 of the top 15 markets, including New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Boston, and Atlanta. Bookings in New York City grew more than 150%, sustaining our momentum from Q2, even as the city led the US at reopening. We've also made meaningful progress in corporate ordering with the Uber for Business platform, adding new enterprise customers like Bank of America, Unilever, and Citadel. We also leaned into a number of growth opportunities during the quarter. We closed our Cornershop transaction in all markets, excluding Mexico, and scaled our grocery business to over 30 markets, exceeding $1 billion in annual run rate. We expanded Uber Eats Pass to four additional countries, surpassing a combined 1 million paid members across Uber Pass and Eats Pass. We're particularly encouraged by the improved user trends we see with our Eats Pass members and will continue to roll out our other markets in Q4. Our ads offering is now live in the US with over 30,000 restaurants running ad campaigns, many with significantly positive ROI. Even with these substantial growth investments, we continue to make progress towards profitability. In Q3, we had over 10 delivery countries adjusted EBITDA breakeven or better. While we recognize we have - we still have enormous opportunity for growth and investment in the segment, we're confident that we can lean in and turn delivery EBITDA profitable sometime next year. Lastly, quick word on Proposition 22, which we're happy to say passed with a healthy margin in California. This important question has now been settled in the most populous state in the country. California voters listened to what the vast majority of drivers want, new benefits and protections with the same flexibility. Going forward, drivers and delivery people in California will be guaranteed a minimum earning standard, healthcare contributions, accident insurance, increased safety protections and more. We feel strongly that this is the right approach. We should be adding benefits to gig work to make it better, not getting rid of it altogether in favor of an employment only system. That's why going forward, you'll see us more loudly advocate for new laws like Prop 22, which we believe strike the balance between preserving the flexibility that drives value so much, while adding protections that all gig workers deserve. Our proposal for a new pragmatic approach is supported by 82% of drivers and 76% of voters. And it's a priority for us to work with governments across the US and the world to make this a reality. To sum up, while the last eight months have been tough, for me, for the team and for the millions of people and businesses who rely on our technology, I'm more optimistic than ever about Uber's future. The tough actions we took, the resilience we've demonstrated give me confidence that we'll emerge from the pandemic on an even stronger foundation, more nimble, more innovative, and more relevant to people's lives than ever before. Now over to Nelson for more details on the numbers. Nelson Chai : Thanks, Dara. In spite of the unpredictable environment, I'm pleased with our ability to adapt quickly to respond to the challenges of COVID, stabilizing the business in the case of mobility and seizing new opportunities for delivery, all with the relentless focus on cost discipline and a drive towards quarterly adjusted EBITDA profitability in 2021. I will now discuss key operational metrics, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. All comparisons are year-over-year and on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. Total company gross bookings declined 8% but improved 44% quarter-over-quarter. Adjusted net revenue or ANR was $2.8 billion, down 19%, but again, up 47% versus the second quarter. Our ANR take rate was 19.1% of gross bookings, down 238 basis points year-over-year and up 32 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Non-GAAP cost of revenue, excluding D&A, increased to 46% to 45% of ANR, but down $320 million on an absolute basis, driven by lower volumes in our mobility business, resulting in a decrease in insurance and payment costs. Turning now to non-GAAP operating expenses, which include pro forma adjustments such as stock-based compensation and restructuring charges. Operations and support decreased to 12% from 13% of ANR and was down $119 million on an absolute dollar basis, reflecting the headcount reduction actions taken in the second quarter. Sales and marketing increased to 32% from 30% of ANR, but decreased $152 million on an absolute dollar basis, as we saw lower marketing and promotion spend in our mobility business. R&D increased to 14% from 13% of ANR, but down $75 million, primarily driven by a decrease in people spend. G&A increased to 18% from 15% of ANR, but again down 14% from a year ago. Quarter-over-quarter, our spend increased $76 million but improved as a percentage of ANR at four percentage points of continued top line recovery. Our Q3 2020 total company adjusted EBITDA loss was $625 million. Now I'll provide additional segment, detail on our segments, starting with mobility. Mobility gross bookings of $5.9 billion improved 94% quarter-over-quarter and was down 50% year-over-year. And ANR of $1.4 billion improved 72% quarter-over-quarter and was down 51% year-on-year, while take rate of 23.1% improved year-over-year due to rationalization of incentive spend, mainly in the US and in Canada. Despite a significant headwind to our top line performance, mobility adjusted EBITDA was $245 million or 18% of mobility ANR, improving $195 million quarter-on-quarter. Now to Delivery, we've seen continued tailwinds related to stay-at-home orders as well as the consolidation of Cornershop results this quarter, driving Delivery gross bookings to $8.6 billion, up 135%. Delivery ANR of $1.1 billion, up 191% due to an increase in food delivery orders, higher basket sizes from stay-at-home order demand, coupled with network efficiencies, mainly in the US. Delivery ANR take rate was 13.3%, up 256 basis points year-over-year and up 56 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to overall improvement in basket sizes and rationalization of incentive spend. Additionally, we realized an 80 basis point benefit year-over-year from business model changes in some countries that reclassify certain payments and incentives as cost of revenue. Delivery adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $183 million, or negative 16.1% of ANR, but that represents a $49 million and 10% improvement quarter-over-quarter, respectively. Onto freight, which grew ANR 32% to $288 million, and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $73 million. Freight EBITDA margin improved nearly 12 percentage points year-over-year, but weakened 2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. The shift in consumer consumption from services to goods, as a result of COVID, has led to a surge in demand for freight. Combined with industry-wide driver shortages, this has led to a rise in market rate and pressure on margins across the industry and our freight business. Despite the industry headwinds, we are encouraged by the progress made this year. Tech-driven solutions can provide value to shippers and carriers, and we've seen this through the strong growth of digital channels like API-tendered loads and adoption of other SaaS solutions like Uber Freight Enterprise. Over time, these real-time solutions were to reduce our exposure to market volatility, while also delivering strong economics. Onto ATG and other technology programs. The adjusted EBITDA loss for the quarter was $104 million. In Q3, we returned our test vehicles to the streets of Washington, D.C., in addition to continuing operations in the Pittsburgh market. Our Q3 2020 corporate G&A and platform R&D of $510 million, which represents the G&A and R&D not allocated to one of our segments, improved 18% and held relatively flat quarter-on-quarter on an absolute dollar basis. As a percentage of total ANR, corporate G&A and R&D improved 8 percentage points quarter-over-quarter, as we saw fixed cost leverage from restructuring actions taken in Q2. As a reminder, platform R&D represents over a-third of the spend in the category and the corporate G&A also includes accrued sales taxes and other fees. In terms of liquidity, we ended the quarter with approximately $7.3 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and have access to over $2 billion from our revolver, providing us with ample liquidity to manage through the recovery ahead. Based on October trends, I'll provide a few comments around our expectations for Q4. In October, mobility was at a $28 billion annualized gross bookings run rate. While we expect the recovery to continue, we would highlight two factors to consider in Q4. First, EMEA, which was our most recovered geography in Q3, started experiencing new lockdowns in October, including in France and UK. EMEA mobility gross bookings declined 3% month-over-month in October. And FX will continue to be a drag on year-on-year trends, particularly with LATAM as our most recovered geography today. For context, the Brazilian real depreciated roughly 30% year-on-year, and we saw a three-point adverse impact from FX in Q3. In October, mobility gross bookings were down 44% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, or down 47% year-over-year on a reported basis. We expect mobility ANR take rates to be relatively flat year-on-year, consistent with normal seasonal declines, despite adverse geographical mix due to slower recovery in the US. For context, as a percentage of mobility gross bookings, the US is currently 10 percentage point lower than in 2019. We expect delivery adjusted EBITDA losses in Q4 to be similar to Q3 levels on an absolute basis, with sequential improvements beyond Q4. As a reminder, we are leaning into delivery opportunities, including with incremental brand marketing spending in the US and Europe, as well as investments in our growing grocery business. We expect stock-based compensation in Q4 to be $200 million to $250 million. Overall, I'm pleased with the health of the business today and the progress we have made throughout this year. Importantly, we are not letting up on our profitability goals, even with our mobility gross booking still down significantly. In Q3, we produced $245 million in mobility-adjusted EBITDA, up nearly $200 million quarter-on-quarter. Put another way, this quarter's mobility adjusted EBITDA margin of 18% was down only four percentage points year-on-year, demonstrating the structural improvements and profitability we have achieved despite the impact of the pandemic. Based on our current cost structure, we are confident that we can achieve total company adjusted EBITDA breakeven with mobility gross bookings 10% to 20% lower than Q4 2019 levels, and we now expect delivery to be breakeven sometime in 2021. With that, I'll open it up to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your question will come from the line Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Just the first one on the individual cities or markets where you've seen a sharper recovery in rides, can you just talk to us about what you're seeing in the competitive environment side for either drivers or riders? Then the second one, congrats on Prop 22. Congrats, question on that, as we're sort of thinking about it, philosophically, talk to us about how you think about Prop 22 now impacting the pricing for the riders, as well as strategies that could change the way you think about attracting drivers and maximizing their overall earnings? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Thank you very much for the question. As far as the recovery - recovering markets, what's - in the competitive environment there, I'd say the environment is constructive. A couple of notes. Generally, in certain markets and the US being an example, as the markets come back, we're actually in more of an undersupply position than an oversupply position as these markets come back, just we have to make sure that drivers understand that it's safe to drive. I think that they're very comforted by the investments that we've made in technology and how clear we have been as it relates to our no-mask, no-ride policy, but it takes time. And these are human beings and what's happening outside is very tough. So, the driver supply coming back is a bit slower than we would want. Someone say that's a first-class problem and we are putting some incentives into the market in order to make sure that drivers come back and they have great earnings opportunities during a period where economically, more and more people need those earnings opportunities. As it relates to riders, what we are seeing is that the earlier cohort of riders who is coming back tends to be more price sensitive. These are folks who have to come back to work. They don't have the option sometimes to stay at home. And as a result, we're seeing a cohort that is more price sensitive in general, which is a little bit different than what we've seen in the past, which will provide some margin pressure for us. Although I tell you, if you look at our margins now, we're more than making it up in terms of discipline, et cetera. So as the world returns to normal, we think there will be margin upside as the cohort of riders that kind of comeback represent a more fulsome kind of example of the ridership that we had pre pandemic. All that said, as it relates to the competitive environment, it's constructive, all the competitors are being rational, and we don't see that changing. As far as your second question, Prop 22 increases in strategies. Listen, I think on Prop 22 for now, what we are really focused on is making sure that we do everything that we can to get the benefits that Prop 22 promises to drivers as quickly as possible. There's some calculation that you have to do in terms of minimum earnings standards, et cetera. So we are very much focused on the execution on Prop 22 as it relates to our drivers and travelers who use a platform. It may have some implication as it relates to rates, but we think that any effect that it has on rates will not have a significant effect on trip volumes one way or the other based on the kinds of sensitivities that we've seen in the past. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks. You mentioned the recovery that you're seeing in New York. As you look at the recovery in places like New York, Hong Kong, even what you were seeing in London before the more recent lockdowns. Can you give us a sense in terms of the characterization of the type of customers that you're seeing, the level of activity? What you're seeing in terms of business versus leisure versus, obviously, the travel part, which is going to be smaller? And then what that sort of tells you about the pace of the recovery that we can expect in terms of other markets opening back up even as we start to see lockdowns like what we're seeing in Massachusetts happen. So just appreciate any additional insight around the right mailing [ph] business that you can share based on that? And then you mentioned sort of the rationality of competition. Interested in any insight into how that carries over to the food delivery business, post some of the consolidation that we've seen there? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as the shape of the recovery, I think, first of all, the shape of recovery, it's a city-by-city recovery that very much depends on the health situation on a local basis, which as I patently obvious, we can't do anything about other than making sure that our platform is the safest transportation platform out there. And I think - I really do think it is in terms of the technology that we have instead there. We looked at kind of, well, does a recovery does commute come back faster, workday come back after, we can come back faster, et cetera. And on a global basis, there is no tail to tell, which I consider great, which is the business just comes back. And there are some markets where work use cases are coming back faster than non-work use cases. The one interesting trend that we are seeing is, as I mentioned in New York, the kinds of use cases that riders are using to engage with Uber seem to be changing, and we are getting kind of a broader demand set at broader hours of the day. So people are using the service, whereas, they might have used it only in commute hours, they're kind of extending the hours, which might be just being more flexible in terms of how they live or might be entirely in new use cases and say, I've got to go get groceries, and I'm going to use Uber. The second factor that we are observing is that Uber is coming back faster than other transportation alternatives. I think, we all want mass transit to come back. The mass transit systems in many cities have been in a very, very difficult state. We believe in mass transit with the investments that we've made in Routematch, but we're seeing Uber, for example, come back much faster than mass transit. Same thing as it relates to taxi. For example, when we look at our volumes versus taxi in New York City, Uber's coming much faster than taxi, again, I think because of the investments we made on the platform because of all the information that our riders have and our no-mask, no-ride policy, for example. So I think to sum it up, the evidence that we're seeing is Uber comes back when cities come back. And if anything, Uber is an advantage form of transportation versus alternatives as they come back. It's very early. Is this going to translate into long-term behavior? We're kind of seeing the food certainly translate into long-term behavior. So we like where we stand, but like everyone else are waiting for the world to open up. As far as the food delivery space goes, again, nothing of note. We are focused on our own service, making sure that our reliability or dependability, the average time to order, et cetera, all of these areas continue to improve. We're very much focused on optimizing cost per trip and kind of the number of contacts that we have. And the result of all that, along with the Uber brand and are continuing to lead into the Uber brand with, for example, the Tonight, I'll be Eating Campaign, has resulted in our ability to improve margins and generally improve our competitive position over our competition. So nothing of note to call out on the competitive front one way or the other, other than we're growing faster than our competitors, and we're going to keep it that way. Heath Terry : Great. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Yes. Next question will come from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Justin Post : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll focus on the delivery business. You're clearly kind of doubling down as a company, buying Cornershop and Postmates. But just give us a flavor of do you think that business could be bigger than or similar to Rides at maturity? Secondly, I think you said you expect to deliver to be profitable next year. Just want to double check that. And what's different about the cities that are profitable versus those that aren't? And then third, maybe a Cornershop update? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Absolutely. I'll start and then, Nelson, if you can take on the delivery profitability question. As far as the site delivery marketplace, listen, I think the TAM that we see in this segment is just as big as the transportation TAM. It is very, very significant. And the crisis, the pandemic crisis certainly has introduced new customers to the segment at a velocity that, frankly, we had not anticipated. We could not have anticipated hindsight the fact that we doubled down on this category as aggressively as we did for the past two, three years. It's either foresight or being lucky and it's probably a combination of both. The point that I would make as it relates to delivery, how big it can get is the extraordinarily low penetration that we still have in terms of the restaurant universe being on the Eats platform. We talked about 550,000 restaurants being on the platform. In the US, we have about 30% of restaurants in the US. In the UK, we've got about 16% of restaurants. In France, it's 15% of restaurants. In Mexico, Brazil, it's about 10% of restaurants. In Japan, it's less than 5% of restaurants on our service. So that would tell you that the growth that we have going forward is going to be many multiples as we penetrate deeper and deeper into newer restaurants. Now I think that's the incremental restaurant that we bring on to the platform probably is not going to be quite as productive as the restaurants already on the platform, but it just tells you that we're very, very early in the penetration here. I'm not going to make a call as to whether mobility or delivery are going to be bigger. I want those teams to fight it out. I think the great thing about Uber is that we've got both. We have a path to profitability for both, and we have a natural hedge, as well as global scope. That's no other company is even close to. Nelson, do you want to talk about delivery profitability, and then I'll end with Cornershop? Nelson Chai : Sure. So what happens in countries where we are profitable, we have a very strong, what we call competitive position, you call market share across a number of the key cities in the country. This leads to very, very good selection, as well as mid-teens type take rates, which we've talked about and how important that is in fact. It tends to be teams that are really executing well in terms of building the brand investment and then continue to make some of the operational improvements. So you've heard Dara actually call out the progress we're making in the UK. And so that has all the making of how you get to a country to be very profitable like we have already in the system. So the result of all this is we tend to have really high customer loyalty and then we have this great experience. And so in France, for instance, we actually have a 24 minute average delivery time. And so we just really outperform everybody. And so again, there's nothing special. It's just the teams are doing a great job, and we think that we'll be able to bring more countries towards those type of metrics as we continue down the path. Dara Khosrowshahi : Great. And then as it relates to Cornershop, it's very early. We love the Cornershop team. And our grocery business now is a combined between Cornershop and our Delivery platform, over $1 billion in run rate. We expect that to be multiples of that $1 billion next year. So we're leaning forward pretty strongly. As it relates to Cornershop, we've signed up a number of partners, Eastern Grocers, Red Apples, Sainsbury's, many, many brands all around the world. And we think we're in the very, very early days. Note for investors that we have not closed Cornershop in Mexico. Mexico is one of Cornershop's leading markets. We are optimistic that we'll receive an approval from COFECE that has been undergoing a rigorous analysis here of the acquisition. We see the transaction benefits customers, merchants and earners and allow Uber Cornershop to just bring far more options to consumers for a service that's now classified as essential there. So it will - we think we're looking forward to getting into Mexico, hopefully, if COFECE approves the deal. And I think it will showcase Mexico as a real-world class hub for entrepreneurship and foreign investment. Next question? Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Yeah. Two questions, please. First, I think you provided a little bit of a trading update for mobility for the December quarter. Could you do the same thing with Eats - or I'm sorry, you did for mobility, but not for Delivery. Any update on delivery for the quarter? That growth rate is staggeringly high. Obviously, it's got to come down, but how do you think about the rate at which that comes down? And then, Dara, you mentioned a couple of these - you mentioned a couple of times, these kind of newer cases for mobility different times of the day. Do you have just some basic examples of what those kind of newer cases of mobility would be? Thank a lot. Nelson Chai : So Mark, I'll handle Q4, and I'll let Dara talk about the use cases. So we do expect you'll continue to see the momentum continue kind of where we are today in the very healthy triple-digit kind of range. I was careful to provide guidance in terms of the segment EBITDA for the quarter in Q4, largely because we are investing behind the business, I may put. So that business continues to do extremely well. We're very, very optimistic. I don't think Dara would have made - we would not have made the commentary about profitability on delivery at some point next year if we didn't see the efficiency as well as the consumer adoption that's going on. Dara Khosrowshahi : And Mark, in terms of the use cases, listen, they're very broad. And I haven't looked at it personally as to what the use cases are. What's interesting is that the number of trips per rider, not all ridership is back, but the riders who are starting to use our service, the trips per rider is up significantly, and during these kind of other times the trips or rider is actually up double digits. And I think - listen, if you live in a city, Uber is just a utility type of use case. People use it for all kinds of different uses. We've introduced hourly rentals. We've introduced the ability to deliver packages as well. So all of the new use cases that we're introducing essentially broaden the service, and we're certainly seeing that broadening translating to a greater use of the service in different times of the day. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks, Dara. Excellent. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik of Bernstein. Please go ahead. Mark Shmulik : Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A couple if I may. The first, you mentioned a bit about kind of what were just some of the drivers behind the MAPC number. And I would love to - if there's any incremental color you can share in terms of what's making that up in terms of whether it's just returning users, new users? I know you launched a new iOS app and like how that cross-sell might be going would be great to hear? And then the second one is as we think about the delivery business, it sounds like ads is now up and running. Grocery certainly and top pharma as well. How do we think about the changing economics for the delivery business is all of those kind of new businesses that are sitting within it? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as MAPC goes, what we're seeing very, very significant MAPC growth for the delivery business as expected. The number of new eaters coming on to the platform remains at elevated levels. And the retention of those eaters has also increased on a year-on-year basis. So we got more eaters. They're staying longer. They're ordering more, and that translates into very, very strong MAPC growth. We're seeing a good MAPC bounce back on the mobility side of the business. And mobility is still, even with delivery being at the elevated levels that it is, the mobility business has a significantly higher number of MAPCs than delivery. So mobility for us, one, is coming back nicely with strong margins, but it's a great loudspeaker that we have as it relates to the new app. And what we're seeing happen is that with zero cannibalization of our mobility business, we are able to introduce a whole new segment of Rides users to Uber Eats. And often, we see them coming back to Uber Eats within the mobility app itself. So we actually - early on, we expected, well, we'll throw them to Uber Eats, download the app, sometimes they'll use a rides app, sometimes they will use the Eats app. A double-digit percentage of folks who use the Rides app now were just using kind of the Eats webview inside of the Rides app, which we think is a great sign. So this, we think, is a pretty strong advantage. It's increasing the frequency of use for our Mainline Uber app, and it's introducing a new - a whole new segment to Eats, and it's kind of a growth channel that we have that some of our competition clearly doesn't have. In terms of the new businesses, the way I'd simplify it is, as it's clearly a very high-margin business and something that we're quite excited about. Grocery and pharma on balance are going to be lower margin than our main line business because they're just not nearly as mature. So I think you can - the grocery and pharma will have negative effects on margin going forward. As we have a positive effect, we think we have the capability as it relates to our portfolio to balance the investments and the growth to get our delivery business to profitability next year. Mark Shmulik : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome Brian. Next question? Operator : Next question will come from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ross Sandler : Hey, guys. Just back to Prop 22, you had provided some stats that if you had rolled this out in 2019, it would have cost you a little bit more in a blog post a few months ago. If we apply that to just the unit economics, you're already above the minimum wage in a lot of markets. So, what's the incremental driver earnings or cost that you'll have to absorb post-Prop 22 rolling out, I would say, in all US markets, maybe if you just do a per unit and then maybe a 2022 impact. And then, back to the frequency and retention for Eats, Dara, you just mentioned that you're seeing a huge uptick. What do you see in frequency retention for each customers relative to pre-COVID levels that informs you about your ability to kind of retain some of this GMV that you're seeing right now longer term? And anything that you're seeing in the data that suggests that the uptick is permanent versus temporary? Thanks a lot. Dara Khosrowshahi : I'll start with the second, and Nelson, if you can then finish up with the first as far as the economics go. As far as the frequency and retention, listen, it's going to be very difficult to kind of look forward. And one way in which we try to understand what's going to happen post-COVID is to compare markets like in New York or certain countries that have opened up, let's say, France before the lockdown, or are in the process of opening up in advance of the other countries and to see whether the retention metrics or the basket size, et cetera, whether these metrics go down. And we haven't seen any evidence of that. There's no question that we are benefiting from the higher mattes, higher retention, higher basket size, higher frequency of order. As we look at open - the markets that have opened up, we don't see any significant degradation of any of those metrics. We'll watch as we go forward. There's no question in my mind that, this represents fundamentally, there's a fundamental behavioral shift that has gone on. I think people aren't going to stop using Amazon. People aren't going to stop using Eats. And we're taking advantage of that, not only to grow our Main Line business, but also to get into local commerce adjacencies. And I think we're one of the very few companies in the world, to be able to take advantage of that, at this kind of scale. Nelson, do you want to talk Prop 22? Nelson Chai : Yeah. So Ross, obviously, there's a lot of hits and end. So it's difficult to really got answer. And so it's not, because you have to do it based on certain volume. But obviously, it's very important that we maintain the independent contractor status. It will - like will result in probably a 5% type increase, in order to cover the incremental, whether it be minimums, whether it be incremental benefits. And we do expect that much of it will be passed along. Now it could be different depending on the city-by-city or the time of day. But again, we - as Dara said earlier, we do believe that it will be manageable. And we don't believe based on the models we run that it will have a material impact, in terms of demand. Dara Khosrowshahi : And this is specific to the mobility business. Nelson Chai : Specific to mobility, yeah, yeah. Next question? Operator : Next question will come from the line of Eric Sheridan of UBS. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one big picture one and one following up on Prop 22, from a big picture perspective, Dara, how should we be thinking about the type of behaviors you're seeing, as the product set you offer to consumers continues to widen? And the proposition continues to go a little bit deeper in terms of wallet share, in local commerce? And what that might mean for, sort of spend per customer on an annualized basis? Or maybe even reflecting it back to, cost whether you could see a large inflection point, in terms of marketing ROI that might give you a differentiated edge versus your competitors. And then on Prop 22, with the industry having one, how should we be thinking about what that means for either other states or even a national solution? There's been a lot cover in the press on potential paths forward for the industry to be regulated, not in the Form 85 was, but maybe to find the middle ground here. I would love your perspective on that as well? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Absolutely. So Eric, what we see consistently is that, as we add utility to both, our Main Line Uber app and our Eats app, the utility needs just more to do in kind of an artful, well-designed way. The engagement with our app increases. So again, with our Main Line app, as we add choices, et cetera, these choices don't cannibalize the Main Line use of app. And we're very careful to make sure we test and learn, and understand what the use cases are so that, we're not getting in your way. But in general, as we increase utility, as we increase choice, engagement increases. And as engagement increases, then retention rates, et cetera, increase as well. We are now in a position to do this for two apps, in two very large segments. In mobility as far as getting deeper into mobility, not just Rides, but we've got taxi product internationally. We're investing in mass transit and many other bikes and scooters, in our partnership with Lime. So we're expanding into, other use cases as it relates to transportation. So any time you want to go someplace, you come to us. We have the cross-promotion from our Main Line Uber app into our Eats App. And with Eats now, we're expanding from just food, now to grocery and pharmacy and other categories as well. And we're seeing, again, greater engagement, greater retention, higher spend as it relates to these consumers. We're underscoring this higher engagement with going out and launching Eats Pass and Uber Pass or subscription products. So subscription products essentially allow riders or eaters to get a discount for a subscription fee every month. We have over 1 million subscribers. We see the growth there as being very, very significant. And we see the frequency of our Eats Pass and Rides Pass subscribers move up a notch, a significant notch in terms of the number of times that they come back. So I think that we've got this kind of a structural platform, two apps, one of which is making a transition from rides to all transportation. The other one that's making a transportation from grocery to all local commerce. The two of them essentially will be cross-promoting each other, and we will have a foundation of a payments platform, a routing platform but also a membership platform as well. We think this puts us in an enviable position on a competitive front. But it's a lot of work to do from the teams. It's not going to be a plus 50%. It's like all of this work gets you advantages of 2%, 3%, 4% in terms of customer acquisition and lifetime value on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But the compounding effect of all this, we think, puts us in a very, very strong competitive position. As far as Prop 22 and your question is expansion. Listen, we have always come forward. We were the first to come forward with this IC-plus model, the idea that drivers deserve flexibility plus benefits. I wrote a New York Times up ahead about this. We want to have a dialogue with governments and other states. We have had really constructive dialogue in other countries like India just passed the legislation that we think was very constructive. So absolutely, we will have dialogue. And I think with dialogue, usually, you wind up at the right place, which is the middle ground. And we think just this IC-plus model, it has huge support with our drivers, it has huge support of the voters. And we think over the long term, it's good to win. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research. Please go ahead. Pierre Ferragu : Hey, thank you for taking my question. You can hear me well? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. Pierre Ferragu : Great. I was looking at your marginal economics between the second and the third quarter in the recovery. And it looks like you - if I look at Rides, you have like a marginal take rate, if I take your ANM like different growth in ANM divided by growth in bookings of 20%. And then on that, you have an EBITDA margin of about 35%. And so my question was, does that reflect well your economics outside of the US, because it looks like that's where you got most of your sequential growth. And should we expect once you grow sequentially with a stable mix, should we expect to start seeing your target profitability metrics, 25% take rate and 45% EBITDA margin, showing up on a marginal basis like that? Nelson Chai : So Pierre, thank you for the question. Yes, we are seeing continued improvement in the bottom-line margin sequentially as the business starts coming back specifically on mobility. If you listen to the first quarter call, we actually talked about the fact that if you looked at the February year-to-date number pre-COVID, we are actually getting to about a 30% margin as a percentage of ANR already. And so we know that we are confident in terms of our ability to get to our longer-term margin targets because of the leverage we have. With the actions that we took on the productivity side, again, we feel confident that as the world recovers, and you've seen the quarter-over-quarter recovery, both at the top and the bottom-line for our mobility business, that we will be able to achieve those longer-term margins. The part of it is that - the COVID recovery is real. And so obviously, as places like Paris and London go back into lockdown that impacts the number of rides and how much people are going out. The fact that all of us are on these calls right now, we're all sitting in our own different homes again. So once we start moving around, we're confident we will get to our longer-term margins. Pre-COVID, we were already getting there on the mobility side of the business. And so we do know, especially based on the actions we've taken that we will again. If you look at our Q3 performance, based on the Rides business being down 50% year-over-year, we think that it showed very good margin profile. Thank you. Pierre Ferragu : And maybe a quick follow-up, a similar question on delivery. You - so you've increased revenues massively more than double them. And you are still far from your target margin. So I guess this is not that much scale - scaling out that is going to improve profitability in delivery. So how should we expect that to come through going forward? Nelson Chai : So again, what we've talked about is the fact - and the earlier question we talked about, what is it about the countries where we're profitable today. As you know, our delivery business, which is really the older breeds business, is a little more than four years old. And so we - the business has gone - has grown tremendously. We run the largest food delivery business outside of China globally now. You've seen the tremendous growth we have. And so we've made tremendous improvement in terms of improving the bottom-line on the efficiency side. We've talked in the past about getting towards those mid-teen type of take rates in that business, which we have in those countries. So as we continue to grow the business, as we continue to move our competitive position, again, we think that we will be there. But again, the path on the delivery margins will take a little bit longer, just like it took in terms of getting there for the Rides part of the business. Dara Khosrowshahi : And I'll remind you that there are many markets where penetration - in terms of restaurant penetration is 10%, 15%, 20%. So we think that the right strategic way forward is to lean in on growth and draw our profitability, and we can do both. So we're in a great position to be able to deliver both. Pierre Ferragu : Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Alex Potter of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Alex Potter : Yes. Thanks. Maybe just a quick follow-up on that question. You talked about the areas where a restaurant participation, you're at the 10%, 20%, 30% penetration rate. Regionally, is that - are you talking primarily about suburbs there in the US? And if so, what's the status update? And then I have 1 follow-up on freight. Dara Khosrowshahi : Generally, our penetration in the cities or larger cities is higher than our penetration in the suburbs. But again, like Nelson said, we really gone into this business in a real way four years ago. So we just have lots of expansion room and greenfield in smaller cities, secondary cities, tertiary cities as well as suburbs. We are certainly making headway in the suburbs in the US. But there are areas like Japan, for example, where we were very much focused on Tokyo and some of the other big cities, but now we're growing at over 300%. And it is an expansion into secondary cities, but also outside of city proper in places like Japan as well. So the move secondary city suburbans - suburban move, it's not a US only effort. It really is a global effort. Alex Potter : Okay. Great. Dara Khosrowshahi : You got a freight question? Alex Potter : Yeah. So, I guess, just on strategic fit, I mean, obviously, it makes a ton of sense. We talk about Eats basically in the same breath as mobility and you can cross-sell. And there's so much strategic fit between those businesses. How do you see freight fitting into that? Can you lever all of the work that you have and all of the great position that you have in other businesses into that business? Or is it more or less operating in a vacuum? Dara Khosrowshahi : So I would like to say, it's operating in the vacuum. So there is some back-end technology and stuff that we can do in enterprise. But it is a little bit different, because it is not a consumer facing business. We think that freight is a very attractive business. You know the progress we've made there. But you also know that we recently raised $500 million from Greenbrier at a roughly $3.3 billion valuation. And we believe that money, that investment will allow us to fund freight until it's profitable. The business continues to scale and grow. And we love the fact that it's doing it, and we kind of judge it on its own. If it - would there ever be a point, I don't know. But right now, we kind of like what we're seeing from the freight business right now. The freight marketplace went through a very challenging summer because of the increased demand in terms of trying to get goods shipped across the country. And there's a tight labor supply because of the - some of the $600 weekly stuff. But we're working through that. The business is getting better more globally. And so, we'll see. So, as you know, Uber has had a lot of different businesses. As you know, we've made decisions during the course of the year to really focus in on the core. And we continue to look at how freight is operating today, and we'll continue to evaluate. Nelson Chai : I think the one other mention that I'll make is that, there's no question that freight is benefiting from the marketplace technology, pricing technology, the technical staff and the infrastructure that we have. Now freight is focused on really delivery from warehouse to store, Eats and our delivery business is focused on delivery from store to last mile, to home. You can't imagine a world that's not a world that is - will be there tomorrow, but we're not betting for tomorrow, right? We're betting for three to five years from now, where we start chaining together warehouse to last mile. And again, I think it is a solution that we uniquely are suited bring, and I think it would be a stage two or three if we get there. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Next one? Operator : We have time for one more question from Benjamin Black of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Benjamin Black : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I had two quick ones here. So the first one, on grocery. I'd be curious if you could talk about the longer-term opportunities you see in grocery from a top line and also from a margin standpoint and also from the perspective of driving either the Uber Pass, just given that growth rate there is a higher frequency product? And then, secondly, I know you guys mentioned driver supply has been tight on the mobility side. Curious to hear how you see that playing out over the next few quarters? And how that relates to your outlook for take rates on the mobility side in 2021? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I'll take the first one, and Nelson can take the second one. So I think as it relates to grocery, what - the asset that we have is we have a giant audience in terms of our both mobility business and delivery business. So we're able to build a grocery business with an audience already and really deepen that engagement with the audience. And so we think the grocery business can, again, increasing creation, increasing retention. And when we look at Cornershop, for example, the percentage of Cornershop volume that comes from Cornershop members, and by the way, it's that we're going to have all of the different memberships talk to each other, is much higher than the percentage of our volume that comes from Eats membership, for example, or our Rides membership. So we do think that membership subscription handle is a pretty substantive one as it relates to grocery. Grocery is never going to be a high-margin type of product, but it is a very, very high engagement product with big basket sizes. And we think it can be a very compelling part of the opportunity here. We're investing carefully but again, are having the fulfillment stack or having the routing stack or having the couriers or having the audience already gives us a pretty significant advantage in terms of investing and making the economics work for that category. Nelson, do you want to take last one? Nelson Chai : Sure. So in terms of drivers of pie, the first thing I want to make sure that people understand is the take rate is relatively flat year-over-year, despite some of the shortages and the U.S. mix being a smaller percentage of the total. So I would say that the driver supply improved during the quarter, still lagged a little bit on the recovery. In the US, what I would say some of the imbalances are really more kind of weekend late night hours as people are starting to get out more. And then internationally, it's mainly because in places like Brazil and Latin America, where the marketplace and the demand has increased dramatically, trying to keep up with it. We think it's gotten better. We think there's a little bit more of an imbalance. I'm not going to really kind of comment too many quarters that out because there's a lot of us do either the recovery, both on the rider and the driver side, but it has improved versus the second quarter. I think a lot of it has to do with our efforts. I think people appreciate a lot of the safety efforts that we've taken, no maximum ride and some of the other enhancements that we've had to try to make drivers more comfortable. I think some of the stimulus as well has put people out there driving a little bit more, and so we are seeing it improve and particularly versus the last quarter. Benjamin Black : Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. I think that's the last question. Thank you, everyone, for joining us this quarter. And huge thank you to the Uber teams. Nelson and I get to talk to you about these numbers, but they are the ones who do all the work. So thank you very much to team Uber, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for participating. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. . I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Balaji Krishnamurthy, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Thank you, David. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber Technologies' Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2020 Earnings Presentation. On the call today, we have Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi; and CFO, Nelson Chai. This is Balaji Krishnamurthy from the Investor Relations team.  During today's call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, are included in the press release, supplemental slides and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com.

Such statements can be identified by terms such as believe, expect, intend and may. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements we make today, except as required by law. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today as well as the risks and uncertainties described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, and in other filings made with the SEC when available.  Following prepared remarks today, we will open the call to questions. For the remainder of this discussion, all growth rates reflect year on -- year-over-year growth and are on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thank you, Balaji, and thanks for everyone joining us today. Since our last earnings call, the world has made considerable progress in the fight against COVID. While there's still a lot of work to do, we're cautiously optimistic that this progress will continue and effect, accelerate over the next quarters. However, longer recovery takes Uber's business remains well positioned. Despite renewed lockdowns in Q4, we ended the year with total company gross bookings nearly flat year-on-year in December with gross bookings turning positive in January. Disciplined execution and increased scale in our delivery business allowed us to improve adjusted EBITDA by $161 million year-on-year in Q4.  This quarter marks the completion of a series of portfolio actions that began in Q2, with the goal of focusing the company on its two massive core opportunities of Mobility and Delivery. We executed 17 transactions in 2020, including acquisitions that increase our run rate gross bookings by over $6 billion and divestitures of non-core operations that, combined with other cost optimization actions, reduced our annualized EBITDA losses by over $1 billion. Nelson Chai : Thanks, Dara. We continue to execute well against the tough operating environment for our Mobility business, investing for growth and delivery while improving total company adjusted EBITDA for both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.  During the quarter, we completed significant portfolio realignment actions, including our divestiture of ATG and acquisition of Postmates. I will now discuss key operational metrics as well as non-GAAP financial measures. All comparisons are year-over-year and on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. Total company gross bookings were down 4%, but up 16% quarter-over-quarter. Revenue was $3.2 billion, down 15%, but up 13% quarter-over-quarter. Our revenue take rate was 18.5% of gross bookings, down 221 basis points year-over-year and down 62 basis points quarter-over-quarter as our business mix continue to shift towards delivery.  Non-GAAP cost of revenue, excluding D&A, increased to 45% from 43% of revenues, but down 177 on an absolute dollar basis, driven by lower volumes in our Mobility business. Turning now to non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude pro forma adjustments such as stock-based compensation and restructuring charges. Operations and support was down $123 million year-on-year, reflecting continued leverage from headcount reduction actions taken in the second quarter. Sales and marketing decreased $209 million as a result of lower marketing and promotion spend in our Mobility business.  R&D was down $126 million, primarily driven by a decrease in headcount-related spend. G&A was the -- down $80 million year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. Our spend decreased $10 million and improved as a percentage of revenue by 2 percentage points in continued top line recovery. Our Q4 2020 total company adjusted EBITDA loss was $454 million, improving $161 million year-over-year and $171 million quarter-over-quarter.  Now I'll provide additional detail on our segments. Starting with Mobility. Mobility gross bookings was $6.8 billion improved 15% quarter-over-quarter, but was down 47% year-on-year and a revenue of $1.5 billion, improved 8% quarter-over-quarter, but was down 51% year-over-year. Revenue take rate of 21.7% declined 90 basis points year-over-year with a 40 basis point impact from a onetime driver litigation settlement in Q4 and with lower take rate geographies such as LatAm recovering faster than expected. Despite a significant headwind to our top line performance, Mobility adjusted EBITDA was $293 million or a 20% of Mobility revenue, improving $48 million quarter-over-quarter. Operator : . Your first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. I hope you can hear me, okay? I'm actually in an Uber, I got back. A couple of questions. I guess, first... Dara Khosrowshahi : Justin, you can ask questions from an Uber anytime. Justin Post : It sounds like some of your -- more of your markets have turned profitable for delivery. So I'm guessing, what is enabling that? Is it scale? Are you finding operational efficiencies? And are any markets at your long-term target? And then I guess a second question, just how are trends in the U.S.? Obviously, you're going to be compared to your public comps. Just how are you doing on delivery and rides in the U.S. market share-wise? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, sure. I think it's basically on delivery, the general business is scaling as our -- as we bring more restaurants onto the platform, as we bring more eaters on to the platform, more couriers onto the platform. Essentially, we get to drive network for density. As the network gets more dense, essentially a courier has less mouth to cover for the average delivery, and our algorithms are getting smarter in terms of routing, in terms of wait time with restaurants and optimizing every last percentage in order to drive cost per transaction efficiency, which then helps our net revenue. And also really helps carrier earnings because they are being productive a higher percentage of the time that they are on network. That, in addition to just the business scaling up, right, if you're tripling revenue, I can tell you that we're certainly not tripling headcount or tripling overheads. So you just have revenue synergy, which is pretty beneficial. And we continue also to benefit from basket-size increases. And as basket size increase, the cost of the delivery stays the same. And again, that accrues to margin as well.  So I would say there's not a single element that is responsible for the improvement in margins, but it's many elements coming together. And frankly, it's the team and the technology focused on continuing to drive hyper efficiency and in every part of the business.  I think the last part I would say is that, as your customer base -- as your established customer base becomes a higher percentage of your overall customer base, you've seen us increase our membership base from 1 million to 5 million, as you get a higher percentage of members, as you get a higher percentage of customers who have been with you for a period of time, your marketing costs should come down as a percentage of bookings or revenue. We're not there yet. We're leaning in. But I think that as I look forward two, three, four years on the Delivery business, there's more efficiency. But right now, we're finding a lot of new customers. And on the marketing side, generally, we are leading in and also getting the additional benefit of new leaders through our Mobility business. As far as the trends versus other players in the U.S., I'd say that no surprise, it's obviously, Lyft, who's our largest competitor, released their numbers yesterday. I would say that there are no surprises as it relates to their numbers. They're a strong operator. And I would say that generally, we see our trends roughly comparable to their trends. Although from the insurance side, we've been pretty consistent in executing well there. So we kind of don't have these surprises, so to speak.  As it relates to the Delivery business, we are in the U.S., growing at very significant rates, triple-digit rates. We see January trends in the U.S. actually improving over already strong trends that we saw in Q4. We can't exactly tell how we're doing versus all of our competition in the U.S. But we think that we're more than holding our own. And frankly, there's more to do there with a real focus being on improving our restaurant selection, which I think holds significant upside for us. Justin Post : Great. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my question. I have two. First one, Dara, with all the cost reductions and the adjustments you made to the business throughout 2020, and now with the Rides business kind of continuing to evolve, how do you think about sort of the long-term rides profitability now? Do you sort of remove those costs and the mix of the business continues evolving?  And the second question on Uber Pass, and you can share with us about frequency or user behavior of Uber Pass members versus nonmembers. And then you mentioned sort of being more aggressive to drive adoption. What types of strategies have you not yet really deployed to drive that growth of that Uber Pass? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I'll start with Uber Pass, then I'll have Nelson talk about the long-term P&L. As far as Uber Pass goes, listen, we are very early in the development of Pass. I mean, we started meeting into Pass middle of last year. We built that Eats Pass essentially on influx that the mainline Uber Pass team had built. And as a result, you see pretty significant acceleration. I think the last time we talked to you, we had 1 million paid members and we got 5 million total members with that number expected to go up very significantly in 2021. While I don't want to give away competitive information, the frequency of Pass members is significantly higher than the frequency of non-Pass members.  So going out and acquiring Pass members is, while it may be unprofitable in period. If you look at the frequency increases and apply them to some reasonable lifetime value estimates, this becomes a very, very strong profit pool for us that either we can pull to the bottom line or we can use to reinvest in other appropriate markets. With that, Nelson, do you want to talk on margins? Nelson Chai : Yes. So, Brian, we haven't updated our long-term margin. But again, we believe we'll continue to make progress towards it. And as you know, even given the COVID restrictions, as you heard in my prepared comments, we were at 20% in Mobility in the fourth quarter. As you know, in the first quarter of last year, we were at higher -- around 30%, and so we're pretty confident in our ability to do that.  The incremental margins we're seeing are kind of in the mid-40s versus Q3. And again, a lot of it just has to do with us continuing to leverage against and get the efficiencies against our fixed cost base. And so we're pretty optimistic that as we get more COVID recovery, as people start moving, that -- we think we're very bullish in terms of the profitability profiles for our Mobility business. Dara Khosrowshahi : The other factor to add there is, Nelson and I are constantly managing the business based on portfolio of kind of profits and opportunities. And while we talk about the delivery business and rightly so, based on the growth of that business right now, as it relates to Mobility, when we look at the Germanys of the world, Japan, Argentina, new markets to get into, as we look at the opportunity to power taxi technology and hailables in general, when we think about the opportunity of shared rides when things open up, and then we look at our transit team, there are many, many growth opportunities in the Mobility segment. So I do think that we will take some of the incremental margins that we see in Mobility and reinvest in growth opportunities because we expect our Mobility business to grow at very attractive rates for years and years and years.  And I think we're one of the few companies around that can afford to invest in those areas. And I think taxis are going to want more demand. Obviously, you've heard about transit needing help in terms of tech and in terms of cost effectiveness. And we want to help. We want to be part of the solution, but it's also a great opportunity for us. Nelson Chai : And Brian, last thing that I -- Brian, actually, one last thing is I would say that you've heard us talk in the past about where we see recovery. In the past, we talked about being 10% or 20% down in terms of getting towards breakeven. And so obviously, we have more room now because of the actions we took. And so again, we're feeling much better about it. But as Dara said, we are going to take some of that profitability and invest back in. So it doesn't necessarily change the full-year outlook on when we're going to achieve total company profitability, but we certainly have more degrees of freedom. And so again, Dara covered and we covered in our prepared remarks, all the actions we took last year. And so we feel very good about how we're set up moving forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Maybe a few on the concept of what you've already seen in some of the markets with Mobility that have started to improve. Curious, just maybe following up on the last answer and some of the comments you made in the prepared remarks. Just what form is that taking in either stoking demand, growing or retaining the user base on the customer side as opposed to investing more heavily on the supply side and investing a deepening on the supply side in the markets that have recovered and/or have started the process of recovery? And how should we be thinking about that being applied more globally and what we should be watching for in terms of the form those investments might take? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, Eric. I think that the team that we have on the Mobility side is -- has dealt with the significant changes in volumes in Mobility and a pretty incredible rate, right? Like Q2, we were able to drive segment EBITDA profitability. So as the markets come back, one is that we're seeing both social use cases come back. So social use cases have been a bunch of the markets that have come back are like over 100% year-on-year and workday community uses come back. The only use case that hasn't come back is the airport. And the teams are very closely watching the balance between supply; drivers, who are coming on to the platform; and demand, which are our riders who are also coming back onto the platform. And what's really exciting is that the coronavirus and everything that's happened, it's actually changed the nature of some of our riders using the Mobility use case. So if you look at, for example, Brazil, we are at 90-plus percent recovery in Brazil, yet 30% of our riders, who happen to be very, very high-value riders, hasn't even come back. So our business is already 90% back and then 30% of high-value riders, of total riders who happen to be very high value, they haven't even started to ride again. So we're seeing some pretty attractive signs. The team has been able to balance the marketplace pretty effectively. I do think that I'm worried about one thing going into the second-half of the year is, are we going to have enough drivers to meet the demand that we're going to have in the Mobility segment. But I think this team has proven himself over and over again. And as the Mobility business comes back, we will look to continue to fund some of the new use cases, hailables, transit, et cetera. But frankly, we've been doing that anyway because those kinds of long-term bets are bets that we should be pushing during good or bad times. Does that answer your question, Eric? Eric Sheridan : It does. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays Bank. Your line is open. Ross Sandler : A couple of questions on Delivery. We've heard some grumblings about increased competition in each business in the U.K., Japan and Australia. So has your outlook changed at all for those three big countries? Are they still on track for breakeven? And is that $40 million of incremental investment, is that for each? Or is that for these adjacencies like Cornershop and Postmates, et cetera?  And then the second one is Drizly, from what we understand, this is an ad marketplace, you kind of breakeven on the transaction and then the EBITDA is coming from the advertising side. So I guess, how does that fit in? And then are there any practices that they're doing that could be applied to Cornershop, Eats or the rest of Uber? Dara Khosrowshahi : Got it. I'll let Nelson talk about the investment. But as far as the competitive environment goes, listen, the only environment we've known in Delivery is competitive. We were relatively late to the game. There were a bunch of market players who had already been, in some cases, incumbent. And I think based on the results that you're seeing, we are able to make progress, grow the business, grow faster than the category and improve margins.  And I think that speaks to the power of the platform. It speaks to the fact that we have access to many, many common components as it relates to our tech platform, our identity platform, risk, insurance, et cetera. And it speaks to the power of the Uber brand and of teams who are local and understand market deeply. So I wouldn't characterize the competitive environment as getting any better or worse. I would characterize it as continuing to be intense, but it's been that way since we started. Nelson, do you want to talk through investment? Nelson Chai : Sure. So in terms of the investment, I think, we said there was going to be probably an incremental $40 million to $50 million in the first quarter, and that is for Postmates groceries as well as other adjacencies. In terms of your question on, specifically around food delivery, again, you've heard us talk in the past, we have a capital allocation model. We go through it every month. We continue to lean and invest and grow. You are right. We are in very competitive marketplaces, as Dara mentioned, but we believe we're winning in places like the U.K. and Japan, where we're seeing high triple-digit type of growth what we saw in the quarter, and we are continuing to improve the economics.  And then obviously, there are some marketplaces like the Australia, as you called out and others that we've called out in the past in terms of not just being very, very strong from a top line perspective, but also very good from a margin perspective as well. Dara Khosrowshahi : And we can agree like that, but the number of markets that are profitable, that then we can use to either reinvest or we can use to increase our overall profit profile. Just the quantum number of markets is increasing and the dollars that those markets are contributing to the P&L are also improving. So those are good trends. But again, it's within the context of a very competitive marketplace. And with these kinds of category growth, I certainly wouldn't count on it getting any better. Nelson Chai : And then the only thing I would add is that I think you heard in my prepared remarks, we will deliver against the $200 million of synergies in Postmates when we announced the transaction. And so as those synergies come in, again, it will be less in terms of the drag as it is in the first quarter. But again, as Dara mentioned, there are some areas that we will continue to invest for growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Your line is open. Mark Shmulik : A couple, if I may. The first, just wanted to follow-up on Eric's question. One of the things that you mentioned are in some of those international markets like Australia, where 30% of those super users haven't returned. Can you share a little bit of color on... Dara Khosrowshahi : Sorry, that was Brazil, to be specific. Mark Shmulik : Sorry, Brazil. Yes. Can you share color on who is kind of driving that demand? Is it just other kind of returning users? Or any kind of cross-sell that you're seeing from kind of the delivery side is the customer acquisition channel?  And then second question, just I think you called it the super app. And as we just kind of look ahead, any updates on the road map there and the timing on how you think about integrating the different pieces into that super app? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. In terms of the user base, I think that it's increasingly become apparent that Uber, as a transportation platform, is recovering faster than other transportation offerings in most of the markets in which we operate. And I think it reflects the investment that we made in safety, the technology that we invest in to make sure that drivers are masked up. And the trust that investors have -- sorry, that riders have in the platforms that we're building. So we see our service come back faster than taxi. In many cases, we see our volumes come back faster than transit. And it's because of consumer trust and it's because of investments that we're making.  So we are seeing new customer acquisition. It's a customer base that tends to be a bit more price-sensitive. So generally, I would tell you that our trips are growing faster than bookings, generally, if you look at many of these markets. And the consumer who -- there's a set of consumers. We're lucky enough who don't need to go to work that can work remotely, that's the consumer who hasn't come back. And when that consumer comes back, we think it will be an enormous tailwind because we'll have a bunch of new customers who have switched over from other forms of transportation, and then we'll have our loyal base coming back as well. So we think the setup is actually a pretty good setup.  I think one factor that has been a little bit surprising to us is that we've also seen non-urban riders come onto the platform with new use cases, et cetera. So in many -- and many times, we've seen core come back, we've seen kind of the outer boroughs come back, but we've also seen suburbs come back as well. And again, I think it's because we're trusted form of transportation, you get a lot of information regarding our platform, and we've invested in, I think we're seeing the results of those investments. What was the second question again? Mark Shmulik : Just around the super app and the time line and road map. Dara Khosrowshahi : I don't -- again, I don't want to give away the road map, that's competitive. But the team is -- I'd say there are 2 factors as it relates to the road map. One is that we're adding more categories. And as a result, you will see a super app that is more complete. And then just as important as adding more categories, is that we are adding -- we're using machine learning technology to make sure that the choices that we surface to you as either a rider or an eater are the best, most personalized choices.  And as you can imagine, we have more data than anyone else in the field. We understand not only use it within Mobility and within Delivery, but across the two. So the combination of more choice and more personalization, we think, is pretty powerful. And the 10% of new eaters that I pointed out in Q4, that was with the super app being available for the first quarter in Android. So like that number is going to go up. And what we haven't really driven is Delivery back to Mobility in a big way. Our focus has been more Mobility and Delivery, but we see real potential as far as Delivery to Mobility or delivery to alcohol or delivery to grocery and those are all areas that we're focused on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open. Douglas Anmuth : Dara, you may have touched on it briefly on Drizly and the acquisition, but just wondering if you can help us understand more just the rationale kind of from a build-versus-buy perspective and then also a little bit more around the unit economics of the business. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I think for us, as far as build versus buy, it went down to -- we got to know the Drizly team. We were super, super impressed with them. And I think that while at a high level, it's easy to say, well, this is delivery of all things, and it's delivery of food or delivery of grocery or delivery of alcohol, actually, each of these verticals can be quite idiosyncratic. And it is hard when you have a generalized platform to go in really, really deep as far as, for example, how do you search for products.  So as one small example, people who come to the Uber Eats app tend to search restaurant first, merchant first and then product. People who come to Drizly tend to search product first and then merchant. What are you looking for? Do you want IPA? They go product first, then the Drizly team is able to identify the merchants who are able to fulfill that product based on a confidential of speed and price, and then you dig, and then you go merchant second. That's just one example of how these 2 products that seem similar, and over a period of time, are going to come together, they're actually in these early iterations, and it's the details that really, really count, quite idiosyncratic, quite different.  With alcohol, you've got the regulatory environment, which is different from state to state to state. As you know, we're highly, highly regulated company on a local basis. And we just saw Drizly team who built, who built fast, we built profitably and also did it the right way. So I think putting together like a product that is first-class merchant base that is highly penetrated and introducing them to the giant audience that we have, that's a pretty powerful combination. And you've seen it kind of executed on in other tech companies. And I think we will be able to turbocharge Drizly growth, hopefully, and also leave that team to execute the way that they've been executing, which is at a very, very high level. Douglas Anmuth : Any... Balaji Krishnamurthy : Go ahead, sorry. Douglas Anmuth : I was just going to follow-up and ask any more color just on how you think about unit economics and take rate in the business? Nelson Chai : Yes. So this is Nelson. So as you might expect, the take rates, the basket sizes are larger versus the traditional ride or even a food delivery. And then as Dara mentioned, it is a little bit different because it's mostly a 2P business. And so what they do is they connect local merchants. And so if you've not use the product you should, they do a wonderful job. And then what they do is that they're competing. And so -- and they're providing, in most cases, the courier. If not, they do use third-party couriers as well.  And so the economics actually are quite good. And as Dara mentioned earlier, they are profitable today. And as you know, they are small, and we think they have a huge opportunity to continue to grow, but navigating through all of the various state-by-state liquor. So if you're in the state of Pennsylvania, you actually can't buy liquor, you can only buy beer, and it differs by state. And so they've done a very, very good job in terms of setting it up. But again, we like the unit economics a lot. The basket prices are very strong. Dara Khosrowshahi : We also think the media opportunity there is pretty interesting as it is in the Delivery space generally. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : I have two questions, if I can. Just first, can you just talk a little bit more about your strategy for passing along the kind of Prop 22 costs? Are you passing the entire amount along to customers or keeping it in California? What are you seeing kind of competitors do and customers react?  And then the second one, can you talk about Uber Direct? How big of a priority is that for this year? And besides maybe grocery, what are some of the focus areas in terms of your partnerships? And anything you can share on kind of unit economics for that would be helpful. Nelson Chai : Okay. So I'll cover Prop 22. So first of all, we believe Prop 22 was the right outcome for drivers and riders and Uber. And the price increases are manageable when compared to the 100-plus increases associated with traditional employment that we would have seen us exit most markets in California. And not just us, but our other competitors as well. So for Mobility, we've increased prices to account for most of the new costs, although we've absorbed a small amount ourselves. And for Delivery, the cost impacts are larger than Mobility. And while the price increases have accounted for the majority of the cost to the customer, but we have seen slightly bigger impact in Mobility. So I guess the shorter answer is we have seen some cost. We do think it's right. We've passed a fair amount on the consumers, but we've also absorbed some ourselves. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then on Uber Direct, as we mentioned, the direct business is about 18% of Postmates business in Q4. It's a much, much smaller percentage of Uber's overall business. And our focus on the enterprise has mostly been as it relates to U4B and now Eats for Business where we've seen incredible enterprise growth. But it's Bank of America, for example, using Eats for Business. So this is actually a -- I would consider it a relatively greenfield opportunity for Uber. We have -- we focused on initially kind of a consumer-to-consumer package delivery through Uber Connect, which has been very interesting. But the enterprise business is one where, frankly, we're going to take the lead from the Postmates team, who has built out those capabilities, already has merchant relationships with Apple, with Walmarts and many others.  And with our scale and our geographic footprint, which is broader, we think we can scale that business out quite attractively. The unit economics of the business that we've seen with Postmates are encouraging. And we think that it will be additive business and margins that are generally comparable on a bottom line basis because you're not going to get kind of revenue -- net revenue margins that are the same as a marketplace business. But from a bottom line kind of variable contribution margin basis, we think the unit economics are going to be roughly comparable. But it's a pretty cool promising business, and we're looking forward to the Postmates team and building on their efforts. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Two questions. Nelson, can you unpack maybe the quarter-to-quarter decline in the Mobility or the decline -- excuse me, Mobility take rate? And then maybe comment a bit how we should think about it in the first quarter. And then Dara, I mean, we're all kind of working through our TAM models. And just maybe how are you thinking about ramping grocery versus convenience versus  versus alcohol? And just how you think about U.S. versus international? Because I think the business is kind of right now at unit economics by geography. Nelson Chai : So the big driver of the take rate change for Mobility is really just mix. You heard Dara talk earlier about the fact that Brazil is almost 80% -- 85%, 90% of where it was pre crisis. And so Brazil, which, as you know, is one of our larger marketplace that has come back a lot faster than a place like the U.S. and parts of the Western Europe. And so it's really just mix shift-related. I think you heard in my prepared comments on the call, we expect take rates to be largely flattish in the first quarter. But again, there could be some variability based on mix shift. And as we see more recovery in some of the markets like the U.S. or like parts of Western Europe, you should see the mix shift benefit as that happens. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then as far as the adjacencies and how we think about the adjacencies, obviously, Cornershop has been a part of our business for longer, for a bit of time now. It's a team that, again, has really built that business quite effectively with a relatively small amount of capital. So they had built a pretty efficient cost base and a service that really is driving a significant amount of loyalty as far as their customer base goes.  So listen, I think if I were to order it, I think the grocery opportunity is very significant. And when you look at the percentage of consumers who have ordered grocery delivery, have used grocery delivery versus, let's say, food delivery, actually, the grocery delivery is substantially behind in terms of adoption than food delivery. So we think the opportunity with grocery is significant. We don't think that the markets have been one.  We have, obviously -- the Cornershop team has a big presence already in Latin America. Uber has a very big presence in Latin America. So the LatAm markets are absolutely a priority. But I think Europe and the U.S. are very high potential markets. In the U.S., I think, our approach is going to be more merchant-led. We'll look to sign off significant merchants. And obviously, then we will expand in geographies that match up those merchants. And Europe, we're going to be quite opportunistic. So certain countries like France, for example, we are off to a really, really strong start there organically through the mainline Uber service. So I think grocery, we're kind of working on all fronts, but the global scope that we have is unique. We're going to scale the business. We anticipate scaling the business at multiples of the run rate that we're at now, which is $1.5 billion run rate. And the unit economics, we don't have to kind of prove out the unit economics, the Cornershop team has already proven out the unit economics. So it's about taking attractive unit economics scaling and really investing and building in the merchant relationships over a period of time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Your line is open. Youssef Squali : Two questions, please. One is actually just a follow-up to that question, Dara. Maybe focusing on grocery and convenience store opportunity. So the competitive landscape seems to be prudent, and it's probably even more intensive than Delivery. Can you just speak to the competitive advantages that you see Uber as having relative to your key competitors? And kind of what are the key issues that still need to be ironed out before you kind of basically, maybe accelerate the investments there beyond what Nelson just said earlier, about Q1? And then on Prop 22, it's now been challenging core by some drivers in the labor union. Does that worry you? And where are you in your discussions with policymakers in other states, I guess, especially given the new administration? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. I think on grocery, I'll keep it simple. We have over 90 million monthly active platform consumers right now on the platform. And we have proven with our Mobility business being able to drive consumers to our delivery app, basically for free, the ability to move consumers and audience across this platform because they trust Uber, they trust our brand. We have all their information and, they trust us with their payment information and they trust us with their location. So we've already done it.  And I think we can do the same with grocery because we essentially already proven out the unit economics. We don't need to make the unit economics work. The unit economics already work. We have a global audience, and that's, we think, a substantial strategic advantage versus our competition. It's really the merchant relationships that we have to work on. And in many markets, we are in great shape and in some markets, we have to develop those merchant relationships. On the Prop 22, we've got Tony West, our Chief Legal Officer on the line, I think. Tony, are you on? Can you comment on? Tony West : Sure. But could you just repeat the Prop 22? I know it was driver support, but I didn't get the full question. Youssef Squali : Yes. So I was just saying that it's basically been a challenging quarter by, I know at least one labor union and some drivers. And so is that something that where is you at this point? And just broadly speaking, where are you in your discussions with policymakers in other states to try to use Prop 22 as a blueprint for other geographies? Tony West : So taking that last question first, those conversations are ongoing, and we were very clear after Prop 22 that we thought it was a good model, a good base from which to have conversations about how you have an independent contractor plus model, one that allows for benefits in addition to the flexibility and independence that we know earners prefer. So those conversations are ongoing in various venues around the country. And with regard to the lawsuit, you may have seen that the California Supreme Court actually denied the lawsuit, said it was not properly broaden at the Supreme Court level. We expect that, that lawsuit will probably show up again in some other form in a lower court. But on the merit, it's not one that particularly concerns us. Operator : Your last question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen. John Blackledge : Two questions. First, on Mobility, could you just discuss views on the business recovery over the next two years, maybe parsing out commuting versus business/airport travel? And then on Delivery, how do you view the long-term profit profile for the new verticals relative to each long-term profit profile? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. I'll get on Mobility and Nelson, maybe you can talk about the profit profile. Listen, I think as far as the Mobility recovery goes, this year, the recovery timing is going to be very much dependent on when and how cities open up. So while we can't predict quarters, we can certainly predict direction and I think we've proven out in big markets like Brazil and Australia, which is, as these markets open up, the business comes back, and it will start growing again. This is a business that has grown for many, many years. It's fundamentally a better way of moving. And I think what's really encouraging is that we are seeing a new customer base come on to our platform during these very difficult times. And when you combine that with a customer base who is going to start -- going to work again, who's going to start going out again, our loyal customer base historically, I think you're going to have a very strong growth profile. So there's no doubt in my mind that, that as we go to look at next year, 2022 or 2023, our Mobility business will grow at substantial double-digit rates. And I believe that we will take share from other modes of Mobility because we have demonstrated the safety of the platform, the efficacy of the platform, the ease of use, the dependableness and the affordability of the platform as well. So I'm very, very optimistic as it relates to Mobility trends. What I'm even more optimistic about are the investments that we're making in other modes of transport and helping the transit agencies of the world recover and rebound of powering taxis with our routing, our hail e-hail technology, our pricing technology, et cetera.  These, I think, will be incremental positives. And putting all together, I think it adds up to essentially a platform for any kind of transport in your city and a unique platform in terms of the scale and global scope. I think that travel -- internal company business travel will probably come back a bit slower. So it may take a couple of years to come back. Companies have cut down on it. They're using Zoom, et cetera. So I think that will be a slow return but I think external travel, salespeople going to visit clients. So once you've got a salesperson to win a client with a personal visit versus someone who just tries to win a client on Zoom, they're going to have plenty of folks traveling out just like they have for years and years and years.  So internal travel, business travel may be a little slow to recover, but external business travel, we think will recover very quickly. And I think leisure travel will bounce back really quickly and significantly, not just this year, but next 2 or 3 years. So we're pretty optimistic. Again, we can't predict near-term timing. But when we look over a couple of years, the trends are there. And I think we've got a great kind of investment profile as well as profit and cost profile as the business comes back. Nelson, you want to take the second question? Nelson Chai : Sure. So in terms of new verticals in Delivery, it's actually too early to comment and be too specific. But hopefully, we've proven to be pretty disciplined in terms of how we view investment. And we've been talking about it with our investors and with our -- and all of you folks over the past quarters in terms of how we go through our research allocation. You've seen and you saw during the course of 2020, the number of different actions you've taken including not just acquiring, but also moving away from things that we didn't think made sense from a long-term profit perspective.  We are going to continue to test and try a lot of different things. You probably heard Dara talk before about the fact that we really want to own the next hour. And so in doing so, we are trying to figure out over the course of the next few years as we move to COVID recovery, what are those things that we have the right to play, and you will see us lean in. And as you know, we've announced that we're doing some pharmacy-type things in the place like New York. You've already talked a little bit about Drizly on the call. You've heard us talk a little bit about Cornershop and grocery. So we think there are a number of different verticals that you're going to see us continue to build on. And it's all about building and bringing in more people into the community. And so you hear about how many people you can act with users we have and so we will continue to build on it. We will be disciplined in terms of the economics. And you heard on Drizly, one of the things we really like was just the basket sizes. And you've heard us talk in the past about the way you drive margin as you get scale, you have economies, you get good basket sizes and you can generate margins. And so we'll continue to do that. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think just the only thing to add is like, I think that it's pretty simple in that our customer acquisition costs will structurally be lower, all things being equal, than our competitors' customer acquisition costs. And in these early markets, because all of these markets are in very, very early adoption, customer acquisition costs tend to be very significant as a percentage of, let's say, economics.  What I'm really excited about with our membership program, now it's 5 million ever strong, is that our membership program just becomes more and more powerful. We'll be the only membership program that is providing discounts on food, providing discounts on rides, free grocery delivery, free alcohol delivery, et cetera, we will have the deepest and most meaningful local membership -- high-frequency local membership model. And what that will result in is not only a structural advantage in terms of customer acquisition costs, but also, hopefully, an advantage in terms of customer retention and lifetime value. And then underneath all of that, we built the payments ecosystem. We built the identity ecosystem. We have teams on the ground in every single 180 cities. So overhead costs and our operational costs should actually be more efficient than any of the other players. So like better cap, better LTV, more attractive margin profile, you put that together and you have the makings of -- we did it in Mobility, we did it in food. We're going to do it in Delivery.  All right. I think, Balaji, that was the last question, if I'm correct. Is that right? Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Great. I did want to say a special thank you to the Uber teams. 2020, I think, has been a super difficult year for the world. It's been a really difficult year for us as a team, but I'm just incredibly proud of how the team stood up. We asked ourselves a question like, how can we help our community first, how can we help our drivers first, our couriers first? And the team really, really stepped up this year. We've got a huge amount of work ahead of us, but yo really stepped up. So thank you for that. As far as our investors go, we will talk to you next quarter, and thank you for your interest, and thank you for your investment.

Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, are included in the press release, supplemental slides and in our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com. As a reminder, these numbers are unaudited and may be subject to change. Certain statements in this presentation and on this call are forward-looking statements. Such statements can be identified by terms such as believe, expect, intend and may. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements we make today, except as required by law. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today as well as the risks and uncertainties described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and in other filings made with the SEC when available. Following prepared remarks today, we will open the call to questions. For the remainder of this discussion, all first quarter growth rates reflect year-over-year growth and are on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. For April trends, we will be providing comparisons with April 2019 in addition to year-over-year trends. Lastly, we have included a detailed Q1 financial review in our earnings press release and Nelson will not go over those details again. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Balaji. And thanks everyone for joining us today. We're finally seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. As vaccination rates arise, infections fall and restrictions lift, people quickly, breathe a sigh of relief and start moving again. There's pent up demand to see family and friends, offices, restaurants and bars are reopening, and even airports are seeing improved traffic. But it's important to recognize that the battle is certainly not over. Cases remain far too high in many places around the world with many tragic consequences. We will continue to do our part, on the ground to help get this virus wherever we can. The actions we took last year in our team's hard work since then had uniquely positioned us to harness the recovery. Uber's already begun to fire on all cylinders. On a consolidated basis, we've returned to growth with Q1, our best quarter ever, April, our best month ever and last week, our best week ever, in terms of gross bookings. Even as we invested for growth, the benefits of scale and rigorous cost management drove and adjusted EBITDA improvement of $253 million year-on-year and $95 million quarter-on-quarter. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with significant liquidity and valuable and growing investments in several leading global Mobility, Delivery and Autonomous assets. Looking ahead, I'm confident that Uber will benefit from the complementary nature of our two large core opportunities, to help people go wherever they want and to get whatever they need. Just last week we announced several new products focused on the recovery. You can now book a vaccine appointment at Walgreens and you ride there all in the Uber app. We're also expanding our reserve products to UberX and to airports, and our Uber Rent product is bringing the magic of Uber to car rentals. You can now rent a car from providers like Avis and Hertz riding an Uber app, and with our new valet feature, someone will drop the car off at your house and pick it up, whenever you want. We've also added new benefits to Eats Pass, new rides benefits to Eats Pass further differentiating it from the competition. I'll dive into each of our segments now starting with Mobility. Mobility recovery started to pick pace - pick-up pace in March and improved further in April, with strong vaccination rates in several key markets, including the US. We are optimistic that this trend should accelerate going forward. In April, Mobility GBs were $31 billion annualized run rate up roughly 280% year-on-year and 68% recovered versus April of 2019. US regional trends continue to improve in most markets with Miami now back to growth versus 2019, while New York City, New Jersey, Austin, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, were all up 70% to 80% recovered versus 2019 GB levels. Overall, US gross bookings improved 5% month-on-month in April, and were 62% recovered versus April of 2019. Outside of the US, we see significant improvement in several markets in APAC, including Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and Hong Kong, which were all positive versus April 2019. In EMEA we saw early signs of improvement after prolonged lockdowns in Q4 and Q1 with EMEA gross bookings up 10% month-on-month in April. In particular, the UK started reopening in April, with our business seeing a strong recovery, almost instantly, improving nearly 60% week-on-week in the first week of reopening. UK GBs are now over 80% recovered versus 2019. In contrast to extremely elevated case counts and renewed lockdowns in India adversely impacted Mobility trends there. As riders come back to the platform, we're working hard to make sure that their second first trip is as magical as ever. One of our top priorities is to rebuild the driver base. Our research shows that drivers who left the platform last year primarily did so for two reasons; concerns about safety and concerns about there being enough rider demand. On the safety front, we're working hard to improve vaccine access to drivers and we've continued to enforce our mask policies and provide free PPE and other supplies that keep both drivers and riders safe. With demand currently outstripping supply, driver earnings are historically elevated levels. Median earnings for all online time before tips are around $37 an hour in New York City and Philadelphia, $36 an hour in Chicago, and $33 an hour in Austin, just to name a few cities. We know that drivers often work simultaneously on other apps so their total earnings are likely even higher, in other words, looking at the more appropriate measure of active time on Uber, median earnings are at or above $40 an hour in several US cities. In several countries, including the US will continue to lean in with targeted incentives for new and existing drivers to build up significant supply which will enable us to achieve maximum velocity as the recovery plays out. Now turning to Delivery, which continues to surpass our growth expectations. Q1 gross bookings growth accelerated to roughly 160% year-on-year and reached a $52 billion annualized run rate in April. We improved our category in several major markets including the UK, Canada, France, Spain, South Africa and Taiwan. In the US, our category position was stable with some improvement in urban markets in recent weeks. Notably, we continue to strengthen our category position in New York City and suburbs driven by improving restaurant selection. We continue to broaden our delivery offerings beyond food as consumers become habituated to having anything delivered to their door. Our new verticals business expanded substantially during the quarter, with an annualized GB run rate nearly doubling from Q4 and reaching $3 billion in March. We're seeing improving traction in many markets including France, UK, the US, Canada, Japan, Chile, Brazil and Mexico. We signed several key partnerships over the past few months, including Rite Aid in the US, Rexall in Canada and Group Casino in France, amongst many others. We also announced an exclusive partnership with GoPuff that will expand our selection of convenience and everyday essential items, directly from the Eats app. To capitalize on these tailwinds, we'll remain in a period of elevated investment for the delivery business, including leading into courier growth to serve robust demand. Additionally, our profitable markets which generated over $135 million of EBITDA, and just over $3 billion of gross bookings, give us additional flexibility to reinvest in growth markets. As a result, we remain on track to reaching EBITDA breakeven for delivery by year-end. Finally, turning to freight. With a renewed focus on the freight opportunity in the US, our team reached an important milestone during the quarter with the business registering its first positive variable contribution quarter, while delivering revenue growth acceleration to 51% as well as EBITDA margin of 23 percentage points year-on-year. Scale and automation has allowed us to achieve what we believe is industry-leading variable cost per load. Our ML and data capabilities have allowed us to tighten pricing and margins on a target route level. And we have diversified our product offerings to new channels such as API's direct directly providing shipper's real time pricing, and our market access product that helps customers quickly and easily source unplanned capacity from the largest digital carrier network, all with one tap. We're confident about Uber freights product market fit in a very large TAM opportunity, as the business continues to scale, we now have a clear line of sight to EBITDA profitability as well. To sum up, I'm as excited as ever about the opportunity ahead for Uber. Our delivery business continues to grow faster than anyone could have predicted. Our Mobility business is bouncing back in many markets around the world and freight is gaining share while improving margins. And because of our actions we took this past year, we're returning to growth and even stronger, more focused and ultimately more profitable foundation. Now over to Nelson, for some details and the financial outlook. Nelson Chai : Thanks, Dara. I'll provide a high level recap on our performance during the quarter, and our balance sheet before closing out what's in outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year. For a detailed financial review of our Q1 results, please refer to the financial highlights section of our earnings press release. Overall, Q1 performance is better than expectations, we had outlined three months ago. And we are seeing our business trend in the right direction each week. We continue to execute well despite the slow start to Q1 from extended lockdowns in North America and Europe. And despite Mobility gross bookings coming in roughly flat quarter-over-quarter and elevated growth investments delivery, our disciplined cost management led to significant total company adjusted EBITDA improvement, meaningfully exceeding our prior outlook. We also made good progress on the Postmates integration, and we expect to substantially migrate, Postmates merchants to the REIT's platform by mid-year. We remain on track to deliver our expected $200 million in run rate synergies by year end. One question we often been asked over the past few weeks, is whether the Mobility recovery has come at the expense of delivery demand? So far, at the high level, the answer appears to be no. We're seeing encouraging signs of continued use in our delivery business, even as cities reopen. For example, in Sydney, we're dining fully reopened more than two months ago. Delivery trends remain healthy even as Mobility has fully recovered and returned to growth versus 2019. In fact, delivery in Sydney continues to be a bigger business for us than Mobility. Similarly, as New York City has partially reopened dining and other services, delivery demand has continued to expand. In general, as cities opened back up, we appear to be retaining our active delivery consumers and their larger basket sizes, even the frequency of ordering moderate somewhat. Turning to the balance sheet. We recognized a $1.6 billion gain from our divestiture of our ATG business to Aurora during the quarter. Our Q1 GAAP net loss of $108 million benefited from this gain, partially offset by the $600 million UK accrual. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.7 in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and have access to over $2 billion from our revolver, providing us with ample liquidity to manage through the recovery ahead. In addition to our significant cash balance, Uber has several valuable minority investments that were recorded on our balance sheet at nearly $13 billion at the end of Q1. Over the past quarter, some of these companies have taken steps to become publicly traded, including Grab and Joby, and their press reports suggesting others may follow in the near future. While some of these investments are strategic and Uber will remain evolve for the foreseeable future, others likely will be significant sources of liquidity. We'll be proactive in maximizing the value from these investments for Uber and our shareholders. I'll wrap up my comments with a few thoughts around our expectations for Q2 performance and some early views on the second half of 2021. In April, Mobility gross bookings were at a $31 billion annualized run rate, up roughly 280% from April of last year and 68% recovered versus April of 2019. We expect the segment's recovery to continue to be driven by improving vaccination rates in the US and several international markets more than offsetting headwinds in markets like India and Brazil. With demand continuing to outpace supply, we will be investing to revive the driver base during Q2. Consequently, we expect Mobility take rates to decline sequentially to roughly 20%, which would also pressure Mobility adjusted EBITDA in Q2. Turning to delivery, where gross bookings around a $52 billion annualized run rate, up over 100% from July of 2020. For the remainder of the year, I would remind you that delivery gross bookings year-over-year comparisons will become tougher as we continue to face significant forecasting uncertainty in predicting post reopening consumer behavior. Similar to Mobility, delivery continues to see demand trends that are outpacing supply additions. That said, we expect our improving scale and network efficiencies to drive sequential improvements and delivery EBITDA through the rest of the year, even as we remain in investment mode for the segment. Q2 corporate G&A and platform R&D should increase to between $450 million and $480 million, driven by headcount investments. And as Dara laid out during Q2, we are leaning in with investments to support the recovery in Mobility and growth initiatives in delivery. Beyond Q2, we expect Mobility delivery and total company EBITDA margins to significantly improve as Mobility demand continues to recover and the marketplace approaches supply, demand balance. We remain on track to reaching adjusted EBITDA profitability in the second half of the year. And with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from ISI Evercore. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Two questions, please. Dara, could you talk about - provide an update on the synergies that you're seeing between the two segments, Mobility and Delivery and how you're tracking that? And secondly, since you've got Tony there, could we get some comments on how you - the response or how you think about the risk related to the comment at the Labor Secretary made a week or two ago on gig employees and being treated as full time employees? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, absolutely. As far as the synergies between Mobility and Delivery, we're seeing very consistent trends. I think last time around, we talked about 13% of Eats for first-time eaters coming from Mobility, whether it's a super app or CRM notifications, et cetera. And we continue to see those trends. Even as the Eats business continues to get bigger and bigger, what I'm really curious to see, Mark, is what happens when Mobility actually comes back to kind of full run because the audience and the masses on the Mobility side of the business will increase. And even though Eats will be growing as well, hopefully, we'll continue to see similar trends going forward. And for perspective, the number of first-time eaters, for example, that our Mobility business delivers is actually bigger than the number of first-time eaters that we get out of pay channels for our Delivery business. So as a competitor, we basically have all of our pay channels for free coming from a Mobility business, which is pretty phenomenal, and we think these kinds of synergies can continue. What we're now starting to explore and see are similar synergies, although, we're a little less mature between Uber Eats and, for example, Cornershop in the markets where Cornershop has launched as well. So not only do we see our Mobility business driving Delivery and Eats, but we expect to see Delivery and Eats, then driving Cornershop, driving Drizly when that deal closes, et cetera, kind of this chain reaction between businesses. So we're pretty excited about it. And by no means do we think we are fully optimized as it relates to this kind of activity. You can also expect that as our membership business grows, what we're trying to do is create more differentiation. And our delivery membership will start leading into our Mobility membership, and we really think we will have the premier local get it within in our membership model anywhere and just a structural advantage that the other players can't match. Tony, do you want to talk - do you want to answer the second question, please? Tony West : So I'm afraid I lost the connection. The second question was? Dara Khosrowshahi : Mark, can you repeat yourself? Mark Mahaney : Yes. Tony, just the commentary or reaction to the Labor Secretary's comments about gig independent contractors should be treated as full-time employees. And just help us think through, the risk associated with that or what are the end cases? How long it would take to get, some sort of resolution on that issue? Thank you. Tony West : Sure, yeah. Well, look, I think, it should surprise no one that the Biden-Harris Administration approach on these issues is similar to the Obama-Biden Administration's approach and which is obviously different than the last administration. And I think that when we look at the, makeup of the current administration, it's fair to say, that there are individuals who have varying views on these issues. They're not all identical in their outlook, and we think that creates space for some meaningful dialogue. The fact that the labor department has said that, they want to engage key companies on this issue, the fact that they said just as late as today, that they're not planning to offer new regulations for independent contractors in the near future. We think all of that creates sort of a real opportunity for a dialogue that can ultimately lead to a solution that gig gives workers, the protections that they deserve while, preserving the innovation that gives them the flexibility that they desire. So we think there's space here, for a conversation. And we're - we continue to kind of look for those opportunities to talk about opportunities for bolstering independent work with those kinds of benefits and protections. Mark Mahaney : Thank you for the color\u2026 Dara Khosrowshahi : And I think from my perspective, what comes through again and again, and any piece of research done by anybody, is that independent workers want to stay independent. They do not want to be full time employees. That the number one feature, as it relates to gig work is flexibility. And what we're talking about is taking it to the next level, which is providing flexibility and protections. We don't the really important dialogue to have. And we think that, if you listen to drivers and couriers, and then certainly, you listen to voters, the answer is pretty clear, which flexibility and benefits of the, answer is going forward. And we hope to have that conversation. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one for Tony and one for Dara. Tony, just coming back to the labor discussion, I know you - you're now living in California with Prop 22 situation for a while. You made some changes to the UK labor compensation this past quarter. Just talk to us about sort of what you've learned from operating in those two markets, when you're thinking through driver liquidity and passing through pricing and just sort of managing a profitable network? How scalable those types of platforms, those types of options could be? Then the second one, Dara, as you talked about sort of the synergies across the platform. Any update on the number of members or subscribers you're seeing on the platform now and sort of how fast that side of the business is growing? Tony West : So, I'll answer - sure. I'll start. Look, I think one of the things that we've learned is that the premise and Dara touched on this in the last answer, the premise that earners on these gig platforms, particularly drivers, prefer independent work, prefer independent, that's borne out. And in Prop 22, you have in California, which is a very Blue state you have a model that was overwhelmingly approved by the voters. And so not only are voters listening to drivers and to earners on these platforms that are choosing independent work, we see that that choice being made over and over again. In the UK, where we have - we do have sort of a flexible third category that, frankly, we would like to see in other jurisdictions. There, we're finding that it's possible to have a solution where you can maintain the flexibility that earners repeatedly choose, as well as the benefits and protections that people deserve. And so one of the things that we have learned is that it's a model that while you won't have a one-size-fits all in every single jurisdiction because every jurisdiction is very different, and you have a sort of a patchwork and different frameworks that you have to deal with. The reality is, is that these kinds of solutions are workable solutions and they're real resolutions to this issue. And so we'd like to be able to see in other states and in other jurisdictions, solutions that draw upon some of the things we've seen in California, in the UK and in other places where we're able to kind of bolster independent work with these types of benefits and protections. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then on membership, our - the number of members continues to grow. This last quarter, we've been focused more actually on converting a higher percentage of our free trial membership into paid memberships, and we're making really good progress there. And what we continue to see as it relates to our members is that consistently, members and especially paid members have much higher engagement metrics, much higher trips per month than non-members. And you can also see us kind of continuing to increase membership benefits in addition to rides benefits, for example, is our most recent deal with our most recent relationship with GoPuff, where you can also get GoPuff deliveries for free as well. So right now, the focus is free members to paid members and really starting to push the differentiation of the membership to continue to drive the increased engagement that we're seeing. Brian Nowak : Thanks. Nelson Chai : And Mark, this is Nelson. Let me just jump in on Tony's answer on Prop 22. So we did see a slight increase in costs, right, because of the benefits. And in the Mobility side, we've been able to pass on the regular cost of the rider. And again, we haven't seen any impact from a demand perspective. On the Delivery side, we passed on much of the cost. And again, the - we have not seen any impact from a demand perspective. And as you know, we've seen this before in places like New York as well. So as Tony said, we're going to continue our dialogue. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. Clearly, our model has pricing power. And I think in markets, for example, like the UK, what we're looking for is a level playing field and other light companies to do the right thing. And we think in the level playing field, we get the network advantage and the scale advantage and the global advantages that allow us to continue to be the number one player in most of the areas that we focus on. Brian Nowak : Great. Thank you all. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. I guess one for Dara and Nelson, one for Tony. Dara, Nelson can you guys just help us understand a bit more on kind of driver supply challenges into the recovery? It seemed like the food delivery driver supply scaled up really well into the pandemic, but we're having more challenges with driver supply on the Mobility side? Is that just during the pandemic drivers moved into food delivery? Is it that food delivery drivers aren't as applicable to unemployment insurance? Any - I guess, anything you can share to give us a sense of where supply is coming back or if we have to wait until early December when the unemployment benefits start to tail off would be helpful? And then, Tony, since we have you, wondering if you can just give us sort of an update around the European regulatory environment. You guys, I think, have made some good progress in markets like Germany, but there have been other markets like Spain and Switzerland changing rules to the negative side. What's the latest on the outlook in Europe and at the kind of federal EU level around regulation? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, sure. I'll - I will start with the driver supply. Listen, I think that the way that I would describe it is that demand is a fast twitch muscle and supply, especially, driver supplies is slow twitch. And both during times in which we see demand increasing at very high rates or decreasing. Now, for example, right after the pandemic, we see supply adjustments adjusting just slower. And the hurdle, so to speak, to drive people in terms of qualification, regulatory and other requirements, vehicle, right? The hurdles to becoming a driver generally of a person are higher than the hurdles to being a courier for food. So that it just - it's a bit of a heavier lift, getting drivers on board, resurrecting drivers. And as you can imagine, because of the safety concerns of COVID, there's a greater hesitation for some drivers to come on board to drive other people versus, again, dry food. So the courier supply adjusted pretty quickly. There were really no safety concerns, et cetera. That said, because our Eats business is growing so fast, and our growth even accelerated on top of very high rate last quarter, we need to bring on more couriers. We are seeing - I think one of the advantages that we have in our network is that we have a cross dispatch between drivers who are just driving people and food, which is kind of a network advantage that we have. We're actually seeing our drivers drive less food and more people, right, because the demand for people that's higher, the earnings opportunities are higher now. And we are seeing encouraging signs as it relates to more drivers coming back on, whether they're new drivers that we're recruiting to the platform or drivers that we're resurrecting and telling them to come back because their earnings opportunities are so high. So I do think that we are leaning in and we have to lean in, but all of the operating metrics that we see are moving in the positive direction and we think that this marketplace will rebalance as it has in the past. It will just take some time and some real focused operational effort, and I'm already seeing green shoots as a result of both. Tony, do you want to talk here? Tony West : Sure. And look, I think, Lloyd, we are actively engaging with policymakers all over the world. And Europe really is at the forefront of those efforts. And really - it involves are reminding folks that our position is very much consistent with the end goals of regulators, who we think, want to make sure that there is - we're giving drivers the protections that they need, and we're doing that while retaining this flexibility. And in Europe, since we're talking, as I said before, we're talking about many different countries with different legal systems, with different forms of employment law, we won't see a one-size-fits-all kind of solution. But what we are finding is that in our engagement, we're able to make progress on having these kinds of conversations. And so for instance, last quarter, we published a white paper, which called on policymakers and platform companies and social representatives around Europe to come together to set a new standard for platform work. We've been hosting business roundtables with members, senior members of European governments. I participated in one just yesterday. So there are lots of efforts that we continue to engage in to try to get to a place where there's value for everyone in a resolution. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay. Thank you, guys. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is open. Ross Sandler : Hey, guys. Just want to follow-up on the driver/supply question and then one on Eats. So are there any other factors that might be holding back the supply besides the safety issues and stimulus and unemployment benefits? Like I know pre-pandemic, a lot of drivers would either rent cars or they would buy used cars in order to kind of come online. And it seems like both of those are kind of economical, even at $40 an hour, you can't rent the car these days. So are there other factors like that, that are holding back the supply? And any color there? And then on Eats, thanks for the charts on profitable versus unprofitable markets. Is the biggest function of the difference between those two, the time in the market, the nature of the competition in the market? Or is it the pace of your new grocery and convenience offerings in some of those markets? Any color on what's driving the difference between the profitable versus unprofitable on the eat side? Thanks a lot. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. I'll take the first one and Nelson can take the second. In terms of driver supply, the - Ross, the big factors are safety and then earnings opportunities. I think that renting a car or car sourcing relative to the opportunity ahead of ourselves is pretty small. It will be low single-digits as it relates to supply. And we do have programs to help drivers who want to secure cars, get cars both in the US and outside of the US. The biggest issue is safety, and we think that issue is being dealt with as it relates to vaccines. And then the earnings opportunities are extraordinary. So again, the trends that we're seeing, like drivers are coming back exactly as we expected them to. Our - the sign-ups are up on a week-on-week basis. And we do think that as we get into Q3, you're going to see the marketplace get back into balance, and we're certainly putting a lot of focus to making sure it does so. So I don't see rental being a problem at all. Next, Nelson, do you want... Nelson Chai : Yeah. In terms of profitability, right now, two of our top five countries are profitable, and we have over 12 countries in total that are currently profitable. And what I would say that the characteristics are is we do have definitely a strong market position. We have good basket sizes, and we've been gaining momentum. And what I would tell you is around the world, we - our business is actually operating at extremely high pace right now and doing really, really well. And we're really actually getting the leverage that we've talked about in the past. Our capital allocation model is working. So we've exited a number of countries last year, which we talked about on previous calls. And we're actually seeing the benefit because we're getting the scale in the marketplaces that we're operating in. In terms of the marketplaces where we're still in investment mode, I would say they're highly competitive. Some of the companies are still private and some of - they're all going public now and that actually beneficial as well. But again, we think we actually have a good plan. And as you heard in my commentary and Dara's commentary, as we think about going to the back half of the year, we are confident that our delivery business can achieve profitability by year end. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then just to add a little bit to what Nelson said, some of the patterns that we see in profitable versus unprofitable markets as - and in more profitable markets, we're able to - on average profitable markets have lower incentive spend, existing user incentive spend as a percentage of bookings. And this is because you kind of build a cohort of very, very loyal users, and they come back to you out of habit, not necessarily from price. Early on, you use price to really grow your user base. Second is as your - the percentage of existing users is much larger starts to deepen, your marketing becomes much more efficient because you don't need to kind of bring on as many new users because your existing users kind of come back again and again and again, which is terrific. And then as these businesses scale, we are able to scale overheads and we're able to scale variable costs, the cost per transaction, cost of customer service, et cetera, all of these costs can start scaling. So it's - financially, its incentives, its marketing costs and then its scale in terms of variable and fixed costs, that get you to a profitable market. This is pretty consistent. And I think you can see in the chart that we have in the supplementals, both our profitable markets are getting more profitable. And our investment markets, we're having to invest less in, which means that the formula for us, the scale formula is absolutely working. It's not linear in every single country. But overall, we know exactly what we've got to do to get this business to profitability Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thanks. A couple of questions. Nelson, I'm just wondering, there's a lot of controversy about labor costs. But as you - you've now had more experience with Prop 22 and you've had more time with the UK changes, any changes to your long-term margin assumptions for the rides or Mobility business versus a couple of years ago? Or do you think the elasticity or inelasticity in the market will help support that? And any offsets on other costs related to the increased benefits? And then second, maybe just Dara, the normal question. People are always interested in market share with competition. Any update on market share in Latin America or UK, would be really helpful? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : So Justin, I'll start. So no, we don't see any changes in terms of our long-term targets. There has been some - there is price elasticity in there. And then as you know, when we made those targets, we now run a much more efficient business. And so some of the actions that we took last year, some of the execution of our capital allocation model really allow us to kind of lean and get the leverage. And we're seeing that as the growth continues to come that we can get there, we are seeing the benefit that COVID has bought in terms of larger basket sizes. And as you recall from quarters past, the single biggest determination is actually that. We're starting to see a little bit of early traction on the ads as well. So as you think about, getting to the target profit margins on the delivery side of the business that will be an important part of it. But again, we do see that, we're not kind of walking away from those margins right now. We're investing right now in terms of getting back, in the post-COVID world. And so again, we are very optimistic. And I think you've heard from our commentary, we're pretty optimistic about where we stand right now. Tony West : Yeah. And Justin, as far as our category position, it's actually a good news story. We've maintained or improved our category position, in a bunch of key markets, the US, UK, Australia, Brazil and France. I'd say, the Mexico is - continues to be quite competitive, both actually on the Mobility and Delivery side. So there's a big battle going on there. But we have local battles all the time, when I kind of step-out and look at the picture globally. The picture globally for our mobility business and delivery business is really better than it has been in the past two years. It really is improving and fundamentally looking pretty good. Justin Post : Great. Thanks, Dara and thanks Nelson. Nelson Chai : Thanks, Justin. Dara Khosrowshahi : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks so much. Just on Delivery, we've seen some industry changes in terms of restaurant pricing recently. I just hope you could talk a little bit about your offering and just how you're thinking about your positioning into reopening, and then also any comments or expectations around commission caps and potential timing there, for anything to ease? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, absolutely. So in terms of restaurant pricing supply, we're - we continue to lean into restaurant partner acquisition. We now have over 700,000 partner restaurants, on a global basis. We expect to grow our restaurant supply base, really for the next five years at least. Our penetration into many markets is still in early days. And clearly, I think restaurants are seeing the benefits of having delivery, as a core part of their business. And even in a reopening scenario, we think that's a business that includes both walk in and Delivery is just fundamentally better business. And I think for us, what's interesting is, we have a business - our Mobility business that's all about getting people out. And we think we can establish some pretty interesting relationships with restaurants, as it relates to getting them out and dine-in and some promotions there. And we can continue to have relationships with our restaurant partners on the Delivery side. We watch competition on a local basis as far as marketplace pricing goes. We think while everyone's approach is different, we think our pricing models are quite competitive with other players in the marketplace. And I do think that, we are going to have a bit more of a focus on pickup. Our pickup business is actually a pretty small portion of our overall volume. And we think that building up our pickup opportunity, as it relates to our restaurant partners, is a pretty big opportunity going forward. And then, as far as free caps go, there - I think that, it's going to differ city-by-city. We do think that, we can adjust the business model where there are fee caps. Essentially, it forces us to increase delivery fees, which we have repeatedly seen as being a net negative as it relates to demand to our restaurant partners. But from a margin standpoint and from kind of a, call it, profitability per order standpoint, we can adjust the model as it relates to fee caps in markets where there are fee caps, there'll be higher delivery fees, which do hurt demand to restaurants in markets that don't have fee caps than the marketplace gets to a balance organically, so to speak. We think the better answer is let the market take care of themselves, but where there are free caps, we can certainly adjust accordingly. Doug Anmuth : Okay. Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You bet. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is John [ph] for Brent Thill. Two questions. One, on the Delivery side, is there a way to think about the trends or the growth rates between the core restaurant food versus everything else combined in terms of all the new initiatives? And then the second question on the Mobility take rate going down in Q2. In terms of the factor, is that mainly for driver supply incentives? Or is there anything else to think about? Thank you. Nelson Chai : So I'll let Dara answer the first question. But on the second question, yes. As we said, we're leaning into the second quarter. We're leaning into supply both on the driver and the courier side. And so again, the commentary is really around that. So yes. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. And as far as the growth rate for food and new verticals, we talked about the new verticals being at a $3 billion run rate in terms of bookings. Our overall business is at over $52 billion run rate. So I think you can do the math as to the relative size. And the business accelerated Q1 over Q4 both overall, and if you just separate the food business on a stand-alone basis. So any way you look at it, the trends are friends, so to speak, and we think the potential remains enormous. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Thank you. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tom White from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Tom White : Great. Thanks for taking my question. There's been a lot of questions on the labor classification issue, but I guess I had a follow-up on Delivery and regulation there. I guess is one area that's seen kind of some - obviously, increased activity, but there have been others that I think, Andrew Yang, the front-runner for the Mayor in New York is calling for you guys to food delivery platforms to share customer data. I guess maybe my question is just can you kind of characterize or share how you think about how food delivery regulation may evolve over the next few years? It just seems like regulators are starting to kind of pay attention a bit more and make some noise? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. Tom, I guess what I would tell you is that we've been regulated on a local basis as it relates to our Mobility business from day one. And these are really important dialogues that you have to have with state regulators, with city regulators. We're guests in every city, we live there. The money flows are local in nature, right? And so we're a local business. And I think our experience on the Mobility side really prepares us uniquely to make sure that we enter constructive dialogue on the Delivery side. And usually, we already have relationships with local government and local regulators to begin with. So we welcome the dialogue. And again, I think that the business model - we want to have a business model that aligns with the needs of cities going forward. So if you look at what we've done on safety and how we've been a leader as it relates to safety reporting. If you look at what we've done on sustainability and our pledge is to essentially be all-electric by 2030 in many of our major markets and then 2040 all over the world. If you look at our leaning forward on IC+, right? These are all based on dialogue that we've had with regulators and thinking about kind of where the skating to where the - is going versus where it's been. And I think Delivery will be the same situation. It will create a model that not only can drive short-term, but more importantly, it will create a model that can thrive long-term and a model that serves communities and service partners as well as our shareholders. Tom White : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. I guess I'll ask two questions. One, how do you know that kind of the changes you made in California that have increased pricing hasn't been a drag on demand given that we're still not in normal conditions, do you have like cohort data or something that tells you that? And then just secondly, can you just talk a bit more around grocery and kind of or will we be talking about that more kind of 18 to 24 months from now, particularly around the US and the UK and kind of your role in that business? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, sure. I think on - Jason, as far as the drag on demand, et cetera, listen, we can't predict exactly what's going to happen in the future. And you're absolutely right, which is a future kind of pattern significantly differ from the pattern that we absorb. There maybe things will be different. We're unable to tell you - when we look at pre, post, how the California markets have behaved versus what the non-California markets? We don't see any significant difference in terms of trends in California versus outside of California, would suggest to us that this isn't going to be a significant kind of economic change as far as growth rates, et cetera, go. And what we have seen consistently with our businesses is that we got pricing power, generally, and this is a service. And you want a service that is valued by consumers and generally, consumers are willing to pay more for. And we have seen that, when we've raised prices in California both for our mobility business and for our delivery business. And I think the second question grocery, how will we be talking about it? Grocery is a potentially significantly larger total addressable market than food. It is much earlier in the life cycle development, life cycle as far as percentage of grocery that has gone online. And for us, I think it's important to know that grocery is a global initiative for us. So we are going to - we're going to be growing grocery in Latin America corner shop. We think can be the unquestionable leader and corner shop continues to gain share versus this competition because of excellent service in a very, very efficient way. In the US, we have a very strong competitor in Instacart and others and I think the US is going to be a battle that we're going to be in for some period of time. And then we're making really good progress in Europe and Australia and a number of other countries on the grocery front. So we expect grocery to be a pretty significant percentage of our business, 18 to 24 months ago - months for now and more importantly really obvious for now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Blackledge from Cowen. Your line is open. John Blackledge : Great. Thank you. First, one driver supply. Are there any key markets outside of the US where you are seeing the driver supply user kind of the US centric issue? And then on the delivery efforts, as the delivery offering evolves and scales to where the consumer can kind of get anything within an hour. How impactful will that be to kind rising your utilization rates? Dara Khosrowshahi : So as it relates to the drivers it is a US issue. We do see in Mexico driver for shortages as well, although that has more to do with vehicles than it has to do with, call it, issues, safety or earnings. It's much more on the vehicle side, and we're working with vehicle partners to make it easier for drivers to essentially get cars to earn. But it's really, US and Mexico, the rest of the world is much more in a state of balance, so to speak, than those two markets. And then as far as the Delivery offering, e we think right now, actually, courier utilization is pretty high just because the amount of demand in the marketplace. But as you look at the Uber Eats business growing, our delivery as a service business growing, grocery growing or adding into the ecosystem as well, all of this is going to drive courier efficiency and courier utilization, which is going to improve our cost per transaction and the ability for our drivers and couriers across this patch as needed, we think gives us even a greater efficiency advantage versus our competition. So we do think that our cost per transaction trend, all else being equal or going to improve over a time as we drive utilization and our cross this patches is a bit of kind of unique model that we have that many of our others players don't have. John Blackledge : Thank you. Balaji Krishnamurthy : All right. Next question. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Pierre Ferragu from New Street. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : ] Good evening, this is Ben Hall [ph] calling in for Pierre and that [Indiscernible] So just have a question on the introduction of autonomous driving, how much made there since you produce autonomous cars in your platform? And then what kind of timeline, do you have in mind. What are your most advanced experiments and tests at this stage are mentioned we expect to hear more from you on this front. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, Ben on the autonomous side, we have established a very deep partnership with Aurora. Aurora is, we think has a leading team in the business and the merger of ATG and Aurora, we think can move forward their efforts, pretty considerably. Aurora is first kind of foray to autonomous is going to be in a truck trucking segment. And that obviously creates potential as it relates to relationships with freight. And then or is in trucking is more of a highway type of activity, which we think makes it kind of an earlier entree or an easier entrees and trying to be - being autonomous on 100-mile highway trip is a lot easier. Let's say, that being autonomous and 50 city streets. That will be an entry into certain types of rideshare trips that let's say are easier. And the advantage of our being able to dispatch appropriately to a human or to a robot is something that's unique to us and some of the other players, in the industry. And that will go from there. But we are - this is a technology that has to be safe, is going to take time for this technology to hit the big time, so to speak. But we are absolutely in a position to be able to take advantage of autonomous, when it's safe to come to market. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Operator let's take a last question. Operator : Your final question today comes from a line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Your line is open. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thanks everybody. Just one quick one for me, on the adjusted EBITDA profitability target by year-end, I was hoping you could provide a bit more context in terms of the various business conditions you would need? Maybe talk about take rate and whether OpEx, you expect that to potentially go down from here? Or is there room to make some additional investments beyond Q2? Anything you can share in terms of the bridge that would be helpful. Thank you. Nelson Chai : So Itay, we believe we have enough levers at our control, in order to deliver against profitability in the back half of the year. We are - as we said on the call, we are substantially leaning in, right, to both supply on the driver and the courier side to make sure we're there, particularly in the US, as the world continues to open. We feel really good about where we are. We executed flawlessly last year during a very difficult time to position the company to be where we are today. And so we know the levers now. We believe, we can - we have a very high degree of confidence. And we're going to pull the levers. So Dara and I and the rest of the management team are committed to profitability. And so again, it's not a bridge per se, other than the fact that we know the levers we can pull to get there, and we will. And so we are definitively going to do what we need to do to get the profitability by the back half of the year. Itay Michaeli : Great. That's all I have. That's very helpful. Thank you. Balaji Krishnamurthy : All right. Well, I think that's it. Thank you very much for joining everyone. This quarter, obviously some green shoots, starting to form and it's great to see are having our best quarter ever in terms of bookings. I am looking very much forward to our reporting, our best quarter ever in terms of revenue in the near future. Thanks for joining everyone. Operator : That concludes today's conference call.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Balaji Krishnamurthy, Head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Thank you, Operator. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber Technologies second quarter 2021 earnings presentation. On the call today, we have Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi; and CFO, Nelson Chai. During today's call, we use both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.

Following prepared remarks today, we will publish the prepared remarks in our investor relations website, and we will open the call to questions. For the remainder of this discussion, all second quarter growth rates reflect year-over-year growth and are on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. For July trends, we will be providing comparisons with July 2019 in addition to year-over-year trends. Lastly, we ask you to review our earnings press release for detailed Q2 financial review and our Q2 supplemental slides decks for a number of additional disclosure that provide context on recent business performance. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Balaji. On our last call with you, we said that we would lean in to re-ignite driver and courier growth. We've done so aggressively, and we've made real progress. Matching and balancing supply and demand, market by market, at the right times, at the right places, and at the right price is the key to our marketplace and what we do better than anyone else in the world. As a result of our driver-focused investments, everything from refreshed digital marketing to more attractive incentives, to good old-fashioned phone calls to folks we haven't seen in a while, monthly active drivers and couriers in the US organically increased by 420,000 from February to July, and we gained an additional 110,000 active couriers from our Postmates migration. In particular, the number of Mobility drivers in the US ended the quarter up 75% year-on-year in June. We also made several operational and product improvements to the onboarding process that led to nearly a quarter of new drivers signing up to both drive and deliver, and we cut courier onboarding time by over 90%. We continue to see strong earner momentum early in the second half of the year and have been able to taper our short-term incentives as we hit our stride. The good news is that drivers increasingly want to get back on the road. In June, 60% of inactive drivers told us they intend to start driving again within a month; that's up from 40% in April. And 90% of drivers told us they expect to come back by September. We are also beginning to see marketplace metrics revert to normalcy in several markets, with surge levels and wait times nearly back to normal in Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Phoenix. But in major cities like New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, demand continues to outpace supply and prices and wait times remain above our comfort levels. Our investment in the earner experience is a fundamental, cross disciplinary, and long term initiative for our company. From doubling down on our app quality, to targeted and personalized re-engagement campaigns, to completely redesigning our onboarding flow to make it easier and faster than ever to earn safely, to rolling out unique programs like free language learning from Rosetta Stone or free tuition with ASU, our Earner Super App is unique in the depth and breadth of earnings opportunities we can offer drivers and couriers globally. We have a lot of work to do and it's on us to ensure Uber remains the most attractive and rewarding platform for on-demand work in the world. I do also want to acknowledge the Delta variant. Thanks to the incredible effectiveness of the vaccines, we continued to see GB growth in our business from June to July, despite the impact of the new variants. Where markets are recovering, our Mobility and Delivery businesses are emerging stronger together. As of last week, our total Gross Bookings in New York City, London and Paris are over 30% higher than July 2019, as Mobility has made a nearly full recovery. Nelson will have more specifics, but we have confidence in our ability to manage through any scenario, just as we have done over the last 500 plus days. Our ambition is to help people go anywhere and get anything. Whether they first came to Uber via Rides, Eats or Freight, consumers, merchants and companies alike are increasingly getting used to doing more with Uber. During the pandemic, we've shown how each of our multiple business lines can provide a hedge against the others. But more exciting is how innovation in our product and brand is driving cross-pollination between our customer bases - in other words, our businesses do provide a hedge, but, more importantly, strength in one business can strengthen the others. You are well aware by now that the Rides app is acting like a free marketing engine for our Delivery business. What may be less obvious is that Delivery is now increasingly driving consumer acquisition for Mobility. That's because in many markets, especially suburbs and smaller towns, Eats is sometimes the first way consumers engage with Uber. We've launched proactive efforts to convert these Eats-first consumers into Uber riders. In Q2, over 20% of Mobility's first-time riders in the US and more than 40% of first-time riders in the UK were existing Delivery consumers, with this contribution rapidly growing over the last year. Over time, we expect our growing New Verticals business to increasingly benefit from, and contribute to, our platform. Already, over 3 million consumers are ordering groceries, convenience items, alcohol and more on Uber's apps each month -- and this is before we have even fully addressed the US opportunity. Notably, consumers acquired through one of our New Verticals offerings spend more than twice as much as consumers acquired through our restaurant delivery offering. We are beginning to broadly roll out grocery powered by Cornershop in the US, having doubled our footprint to more than 400 cities in the last few weeks, and expect this to be the next pillar of growth for Uber. Underpinning all of this is our membership program. Just a year ago we began to roll out Uber Pass in earnest. It now drives 30% of Delivery GBs in the US, and roughly 25% globally. Consumers who regularly engage with both Mobility and Delivery now account for nearly half of our total company Gross Bookings. For these consumers in particular, Pass is a no-brainer, and we see a long runway for increased adoption. We're also seeing the benefits of cross-platform synergies for merchants and other businesses. Uber remains the largest global on-demand delivery platform outside of China, with more than 750,000 monthly active merchants on our platform. And our leadership position continues to grow. We are now the category leader in 8 of our top 10 Delivery markets, with clear number two positions in the US and UK. We're proud that Uber Eats, Postmates, and Cornershop helped many small businesses offset the loss of in-store traffic during lockdowns. But as cities reopen, these merchants are discovering that delivery demand is additive, even as in-store traffic comes back. Merchants have increasingly embraced our Ads offering to drive significant demand amplification at a reasonable cost. Our original goal was to exit this year with $100 million of Ads run-rate revenue, but we now expect to surpass that goal and end 2022 with at least $300 million in run-rate revenues. Beyond last-mile delivery, Uber is increasingly powering first- and middle-mile logistics with Uber Freight. Notably, roughly 50% of our freight volumes come from grocery and consumer staples shippers. Freight has successfully disrupted the freight brokerage market with our innovative technology, and is now one of the largest digital freight brokers globally excluding China. We believe there is a large opportunity to be the preferred end-to-end logistics partner for shippers. 80% of shipper decision-makers manage both full truck loads as well as last-mile shipping, and almost 60% of surveyed customers have last-mile needs. With the pending acquisition of Transplace, we have the potential to create the first end-to-end digital logistics platform that could one day power the movement of goods all the way from the point of production to the consumer. While none of us can predict the macro future or the effects of the Delta variant going forward, we continue to see Uber gaining momentum, as we expand our services and footprint and become a bigger part of the daily local habits of millions of consumers, earners, merchants, and shippers all over the world. We see the path to sustainable and improving EBITDA profitability in the next six months, but it's our growth potential over the next 5 to 10 years that has me and this team excited and hungry to Uber On. Now, over to Nelson. Nelson Chai : Thanks, Dara. As Dara mentioned, we are of course still seeing impacts from the virus. However, on balance, we continued to make good progress, with total Gross Bookings growing from June to July. Mobility Gross Bookings were at a $39 billion run-rate in July, with Gross Bookings up 6% month-over-month and 83% recovered vs. July 2019. US and Canada Mobility Gross Bookings were up 7% month-over-month and 76% recovered vs. July 2019, while trips were up 9% month-over-month. EMEA and LatAm were nearly fully recovered on a GB basis vs. July 2019, while APAC was a mixed bag with New Zealand, Hong Kong and Japan growing vs. July 2019, but India, Australia and Taiwan impacted by ongoing or new lockdowns. Delivery Gross Bookings were at a $51 billion run-rate in July, with Gross Bookings up 4% month-over-month, up 56% year-over-year and up over 260% vs. July 2019. Delivery has remained relatively steady since March, even as cities reopened. We are witnessing very healthy trendlines in major markets like Sydney, New York, and London, with Paris as an outlier where we have seen some modest pullback. Next, a word on M&A. Our business has a huge amount of organic momentum, and we will always aim to have the vast majority of our growth be organic. Indeed, our Delivery business has organically grown at a greater than 100% compound growth rate over the past four years. At the same time, we do not hesitate to leverage M&A where appropriate, including both acquisitions and divestitures. Just as we divested several assets last year that along with cost rationalization helped improve our cost base by over $1 billion, we have also made several attractive acquisitions. For instance, our acquisition of Careem has led to markets in the Middle East turning into some of our most profitable markets, operating well above our Mobility long-term margin targets. More recently, our acquisition of Postmates has helped us establish a number one position in LA, the second largest Delivery market in the US, while allowing us to execute organically to establish category leadership in NYC at the same time. We have now largely completed the integration process, and expect to deliver on our synergies targets laid out at the time of the acquisition. Turning to our balance sheet, the past few months have been eventful for Uber's equity investment portfolio, as several of our portfolio companies took steps to become publicly traded companies, including Didi, Zomato, Grab, Aurora, and Joby. At the end of Q2, our equity stakes portfolio was carried at nearly $15 billion, or over $7 per Uber share. As we have previously noted, some of these stakes are more strategic and others are more financial, with Didi being the clearest example of the latter for us. As we emerge from our post-IPO lockup restrictions, we will evaluate some of these positions, as long as the market is reflecting a reasonable value for them. As we have said previously, we don't intend to run an investment firm, but we have sufficient liquidity to ensure that we have the flexibility to maintain those positions with the aim of maximizing value for Uber and our shareholders. Finally, turning to outlook. We were very clear in the spring that our Mobility marketplace in the US was not delivering the magical experience we have all taken for granted, as consumer demand returned faster than drivers as markets opened up. We emphasized that it was not okay and we would proactively invest to reenergize supply. As expected, these efforts impacted our margins and adjusted EBITDA in Q2. At the same time, we also told investors that we have the levers available to achieve total company quarterly Adjusted EBITDA profitability this year. We remain committed to it. The good news is driver supply has been growing and our marketplace dynamics are improving, drivers on our platform are earning more than other alternatives. Our gross bookings continue to grow and in July our margins are already improving, benefiting from our investment in Q2 to accelerate the flywheel. In July, new driver additions on Uber in the US grew 30% month over month, that's right, over 30% month over month, even as we pulled back on incentives and improved our margins. As our investments taper, we expect Mobility to show strong leverage in the back half. For context, in major markets like Australia, Canada, France, and UAE where supply was organically recovering without significant investments from Uber, our Mobility EBITDA margin in Q2 exceeded long-term targets, ranging from 46% to 67% of revenue. In the US, our take rate in Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix has nearly reverted to pre-COVID levels in July. We expect our delivery business to continue to improve its bottom line while growing at scale. Our Delivery business outside the US and Canada was just shy of breaking even in Q2, while we consciously leaned into the US to improve our category position. We expect to start delivering on our Postmates synergy targets in Q3, and deliver additional leverage through improving network efficiencies and lower incentive spend across our global footprint. We expect Freight to continue to grow and manage its investment levels for the balance of the year and we will continue to manage our corporate overheads. Pre-COVID, we used to provide guidance around our expected annual Gross Bookings and adjusted EBITDA, which we believe provides investors with some transparency on our near-term goals, without being overly focused on quarterly fluctuations. With our business emerging from the pandemic, we believe this quarter is the right time to return to providing guidance around near-term trends. However, there is still a reasonable amount of uncertainty in the world, and as a result, we will provide guidance for Q3 this call. With that context, for Q3, we expect total company Gross Bookings to be between $22 billion and $24 billion and total company adjusted EBITDA to be better than the loss of $100 million. And for Q4 we expect to achieve total company EBITDA profitability. So with that, let's open it up for question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Your line is open. Ross Sandler : Hey, guys. Thanks for the color on the guidance. Just a question on 3Q for the Rides business. It looks like your EBITDA is doing swing thoughts about $300 million to $350 million to above $500 million or so. So how should we think about the take rates in Rides in 3Q system-wide? You mentioned a few cities there back into the pre-COVID levels. But how do we think about overall take rate? And then what level of driver incentives are baked into that EBITDA run rate? Thanks a lot. Dara Khosrowshahi : So, Ross, as you heard in my prepared comments, we did give some update about what we're seeing in July. And you heard us talk mentioned not only a growth, but the margins are improving. So, if margins and take rate stay where they were just in July. So, we just hold on, and then we continue to grow our volume as we expect. We will be comfortably within the ranges that we're talking about there. So, we're already seeing that pullback and I think you heard my stat that we increased new drivers on the Uber platform in the US by 30% between July versus June. And that's as we pulled back on incentives, because again when we did this, we knew what we wanted to build long-term sustainable profitability and growth. As you saw coming out of the pandemic, our marketplace wasn't operating efficiently or functionally correctly and you heard in my comments. So, we invested on the supply side to get our marketplace healthy again and we're seeing the benefits of that today. So, we are able to pull back on incentives. If you just look at where we are in July and you run that forward we should be able to achieve that kind of range that you're talking about, which is why you saw, I mean put out the guidance on Q3 on the bottom line and also in the investor deck, there's a chart on that which hopefully provide some simple ranges to help guide in terms of where we're getting to. Our next question? Operator : Your next question is from Justin Post from Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thanks. I think there might be a little confusion on the investment levels at Uber versus basically Lyft in the US. Could you explain why it might be a little bit different dynamics in the second quarter? And why you may have a bigger profitability pivot? And then maybe if you could -- if you can give us an organic update on Delivery maybe ex-Postmates or some of the acquisitions. Just how you did organically in the quarter? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. Sure. Listen, we can't speak for Lyft, but I think on balance we were super aggressive as it relates to drive our acquisition levels and when we compare the number of new drivers coming onto the platform quarter-on-quarter, month-on-month, the monthly active drivers directly against at least the numbers that we heard from Lyft, our numbers are higher on a direct comparable basis. So, I think that if you compare our numbers to Lyft again, we're not privy to their numbers. We invested early and aggressively and we're seeing very positive momentum as a result of that early investment and we've been able to pull back as it relates to incentives and revenue margins in July have come up significantly over Q2 and the momentum that we see in driver and courier growth is continuing if not strengthening. So that gives us a lot of confidence, as it relates to Q4 -- Q3 in terms of revenue margins, take rate, and in terms of EBITDA. And we think the Q2 investment that we made was the right investment. And it puts us in very, very good stead as it relates to Q3 and Q4. As far as Eats goes, the vast majority of Eats' growth is organic. So, broadly, we are seeing monthly active eaters on a global basis up about 40% on a year-on-year basis. We are seeing basket sizes of about 10% on a yearly basis. We're seeing frequency of orders up as well. So, the organic growth rates for Uber Eats as well over 50% and most of that is really about continuing to build up audience on a year-on-year basis. We're obviously happy with the Postmates acquisition in terms of being able to drive synergy value and getting to a number one position in LA. We're number one in New York as well, but it's really about the organic growth. And it's about active eaters, it's about basket size and it's about orders per eater and all of those are running positive for Q2. And we think they'll continue to run positive for Q3 and Q4. Justin Post : Great. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Your next question is from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on sort of the point around the investment in the drivers. I feel like we pay so much attention to these access incentives. But when you're talking about marketing and on board costs and background checks and vaccination promotion education. Can you just help us better understand a little bit, how big was the investment to bring on more drivers in the quarter? And how do we think about that throughout the course of the year? Just so you can sort of think about 2022 and hopefully, those costs are not as big of a burden? And then secondly on Uber Pass, I appreciate the color on the volumes. So, it was a bit more than areas you think you've had some success in driving adoption Uber Pass, and in your mind still low hanging fruit areas to drive more adoption of that for riders as the rise recovery continues. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. So, in terms of driver acquisition spend the heaviest driver acquisition spend and incentive spend that we think we will see and we saw was in Q2. We really have to take action very quickly because the marketplace was not at a place that we considered healthy. And we wanted to lean into get wait times down to get service levels down. And all of those metrics in general as far as surge and wait times are moving in the right direction. And in a bunch of cities, southern cities et cetera there actually back to normal. And the vast majority of the spend as it relates to driver acquisition is really incentives. It's about putting dollars in front of drivers, and our top 20 cities drivers for Mobility are making over $40 an active our including just earnings and tips as well. So, the good news is, we're now in a place where we're able to put those -- pull those investments back. If you look at July volume growth will add about $200 million in EBITDA, take rate improvements will add about $150 million in EBITDA, which gives us a lot of confidence as it relates to our Q3 numbers. And we're running positive in these numbers on theoretical there based on actual July numbers. So, I think from that standpoint, the investments were big, I thought investments were well worth it and we're on the positive side of the ledger so to speak. As far as Uber Pass goes, the most important factor for what you asked for us is, what is the retention rate. And what we're seeing is, after some optimization building up the product et cetera, the retention rate for our cohorts that are with us more than six months is now 98% retention rate on a month-on-month basis. So now that we have really perfected the products driven the savings et cetera, we can now lean into member growth, the vast majority of member growth is going to be organic. It's putting the product in front of both our riders and drivers we see the Mobility business coming back is going to be a big benefit and you've heard us talk about how users who use both Mobility and Delivery account for more than 50% of our gross bookings on a global basis. So, now that we have the retention. We can step on the gas in terms of acquisition, but we're really going to take advantage of that 100 million monthly active platform customers and put what's a great product in front of them and we think that we'll get a significant amount of organic traction there. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Mahaney from ISI. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Question on the drivers, you mentioned those two numbers about that drivers up 75% year-over-year in June and a couple of 100,000 from February to July. Those drivers, do you -- can you tell us how many of those are absolutely new drivers to the platform versus lapsed drivers or people who didn't drive during the COVID crisis and have come back? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, Mark. We can. And the majority of drivers who are coming back to the platform or what we call resurrecting drivers they've driven, whether it's in the past number one reason why they had not driven as because of safety concerns vaccines COVID et cetera as vaccination rates go up, we are seeing the resurrecting drivers come back. So, because of the size and scale the business we can reach into our database and we are getting real momentum in terms of those resurrections coming back. So, I think all of the signs are quite positive. Mark Mahaney : And one quick follow-up question, please. Any comments -- updated comments on the regulatory outlook? And particularly on the state of Massachusetts? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. When we think of the state of Massachusetts, listen, we think the right answer is our IC+ model, right, which is independent contractor with benefits, our drivers love it, Prop 22 has proven to be incredibly popular with California drivers. The vast majority of drivers prefer IC+ over employment, full-time employment. And with Massachusetts, we're -- I think that voters in California voted for because they had driver support. I see no reason why voters in Massachusetts are going to be any different. We absolutely prefer a legislative outcome in Massachusetts. But if we can get there we'll take you to vote and based on what happened in California, we're quite confident. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Next question? Operator : Your next question is from Doug Anmuth from J. P. Morgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to clarify on driver supply, I think in a few months ago, kind of your expectation was that things would kind of return to normal in the third quarter -- by the end of the third quarter, is that kind of still what you're expecting here given your trajectory and the tapering that you've mentioned? And then second on profitability, is that overall in Delivery profit in the fourth quarter? I just wanted to clarify there. Thanks. Nelson Chai : Yes. On the fourth quarter, it's total company EBITDA profitability and then even in the third quarter guidance was total company as well as that includes all aspects of the business, but if you -- on my prepared comments I just fact that we'll continue to make progress and improvement on Delivery and we'll -- and again, we expect our EBITDA profitability of our Mobility business continues to improve. And again we're pretty confident in terms of how we're doing it, which is why we put out the guidance for Q3. Dara Khosrowshahi : But I think if you look in the supplemental slides you also see that our Delivery business outside of the US is an inch away from EBITDA profitability. So, again this is in a theory we're executing on it quite effectively and we're confident in our stance overall profitability. And then lastly, you did mentioned something about driver supply returning. And so, what I would say is that you heard us both made comments in the prepared remarks that again we invested heavily in Q2. We're seeing the benefit even in July, which we talked about the margins are improving. We're adding more drivers and we've pulled back on incentives and what I would suggest is that our ability to achieve those numbers is really just based on take rates where they are in July point forward for the rest of the quarter. And I do think on drivers of audit, yeah, I think that I would add is. It's not just a question on money and less in short-term we have to lean in as it relates to incentives and driver earnings are definitely high and obviously driving is a very flexible way to earn. But I would also underlie the operational and the tech improvements that we have made. So, for example, now we're testing the capability to bring on driver is usually when someone want to drive a person. We have to do background checks, et cetera, and not just in the state that you live and other states as well. We can onboard drivers very quickly to deliver food and as we process all of the regulatory checks that we have to be very careful that we do on the ground in each state. We can then move them over to driving for the Mobility business as well. And that has allowed the on-boarding flows a CRM campaigns that we are driving the incentive technology has allowed us to move from a period of heavy spend and adding drivers to much less heavy spend so to speak and adding both couriers and drivers at the fastest pace that we have for the year. I mean, July looks really good and if August and September or anything like July, we will be in very, very good shape. Doug Anmuth : Great. That's helpful. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thank you. Any color just as it relates to pricing trends for the second half? And how we should think about that? And Dara on the Eats business, if you could just comment on the frequency, I know you had mentioned on the last call that there is perhaps a slowdown in terms of frequency. How are you thinking about now as you look forward? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I'll start with the second first, which is we actually have not seen a material decrease in frequency as it relates to our Delivery business. And we think it's just because of higher portion of our delivery customers are using the Pass. So, we always thought that could be an offset but we weren't sure of the relative offset between task because as non-members become Pass members and they have free trials and especially if they when they graduate into paid membership and then that six-month cohort that has a 98% retention. The number of orders per eater and riders and rides per rider goes up materially. So, the question for us as well, is that positive momentum of membership going to outdo? Let's say, the negative of cities open up. And so far that as the case so that orders per eater has stayed very consistent and people were going out, which is great. But we do think that order per eater there'll be a tailwind in terms of orders per eater as we continue to drive membership. As far as pricing trends in the second half, we are seeing in July and early August. We are seeing pricing ease. It's still up year-on-year, but the pace of the price increases looks like it's easing as we get into a more normalized supply situation, which we think is a great as a real positive for the marketplace. Brent Thill : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of ones. So, first on Eats EBITDA given the high incremental margins on this business below the revenue margins, how much are you reinvesting into the business right now on non-food and some of these other categories? And what are the trends -- underlying trends in terms of profitability of the core of our food business? And then second question, just a follow-up on the rights take rate. In addition to US grow, you also saw European markets recover during our second quarter with the impact of driver incentives is somewhat low. So, is the 280 basis point sequential decline and take rate predominantly from US, can you give some color on kind of quantifying it by geographical regions? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. As far as the Delivery goes, we are spending a fair amount as it relates to Grocery and New Verticals, et cetera. Grocery and New Verticals accounts for about 5% to 6% of our overall GB's and it's growing at pretty healthy rates, but we think that we can get to delivery EBITDA profitability by the end of the year, including Grocery as well. So, yes, we're leading into those parts of the business, but really the Delivery story for us is as a larger percentage of our delivery customers are repeat customers. Our the incentives that we have to put into the marketplace, the marketing spend that we have to spend to the marketplace comes down. Generally, in the U.S., and other markets as the marketplace becomes more efficient and we get kind of more frequency in the marketplace, we're able to drive the cost per trip down because couriers can batch -- we can batch two or three deliveries per courier at the time that they have to be on the trip reduces as we add more restaurants into the marketplace, et cetera. So, the combination of marketing efficiencies that we get and cost per trip efficiencies that we get allow us to continue to invest aggressively in growing our Delivery business. But at the same time improving our margins as well and investing into the grocery business. Nelson Chai : Regarding your question on the take rates, you're right. In APAC and Latin America, we are not expecting any take rate changes, if you will. So, much of the investment was in the US and Canada and there was actually some in Europe as well in order to get drivers back and help build supply. Deepak Mathivanan : Got it. Okay. Thank you so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Operator : Your next question is from John Blackledge from Cowen. Your line is open. John Blackledge : Great. Thanks. Two questions. First on the Delta-variant. Could you talk about Mobility trends in the recent weeks and in areas where Delta-variant has spiked in? And also delivery trends along the same lines. And then on Delivery, second question how is Uber differentiating versus other competitors in Grocery and other across different geos? And then what's kind of the goal on the US, given the US at several scale players in that market? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I think as it relates to Delta-variant trends, where we have seen shutdowns, we see significant changes as it relates to the power end of the business. So, for example, if you look at our supplemental deck, Australia and Sydney for example where City shut down, we see Mobility obviously take a hit. But we see essentially the opposite happen in the delivery side of the business that's a hedge that we talked about. And even net of the hedge Mobility and Delivery tend to be up pretty significantly on a year-on-year basis. Certainly, if we compare to 2019 volumes as well where we don't see where there aren't shutdowns, it's really hard to tell me you know it's people still want to go out and there may be slight changes in behavior But the non-material changes in behavior and some of the underlying growth that we see in the business takes over. So, certainly the July trends that we saw relative to June were pretty encouraging, but no one can predict what's going to happen with Delta going forward. But so far we're hedged, and the trends that we're seeing are pretty good. As it relates to differentiating and delivery, listen I think that the differentiator that we have is the audience and the Uber platform, right? So, we actually were late in the Delivery game, we were one of the latest players to build up Delivery business. We built it based on the Uber brand, the marketplace matching technology that we have the pricing technology routing et cetera. Three-quarters of essentially elements of what is a ride, and what to delivering ultimately what's going to be a grocery three quarters of the elements that we're building in our stack. Our common elements that our engineers are coding. So, we essentially get to have engineers working on common elements. We got bigger datasets than anyone else. We're able to train our algorithms over much larger data points global data points versus our competitors, which allow us to build a matching, routing, incentives and marketing engine that is more personalized and just have greater capabilities than anyone else. At the same time, we have ops teams on the ground in every single market. We understand the regulatory marketplace the overheads that we have or much lighter than our competitors. It all translates into cost of customer acquisition is lower, lifetime value is higher because of the higher frequency counts that we have with our customers and overheads are low. So, lower cost of customer acquisition, higher lifetime value, lower overheads and greater tech capabilities, that's the differentiator. We built Eats has now number one in eight out of top 10 markets. And we think grocery. We're off to a great start internationally in the US Instacart at the really strong competitor. I think in the US, we're going to be practical. We're going to build out our merchant base and we're going to lean in on the Rides and Eats audience to build up grocer in the US. But it's a bigger audience than anyone else has. So, we think that's a great asset to have. John Blackledge : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from James Lee of Mizuho. Your line is open. James Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us an update on competition with Didi given their issues with the regulatory bodies in China? Are you seeing them any pullback from their perspective on the international operations? I know you guys competing within South America and EMEA. Any update would be helpful? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : So, as you know, it's happened very recently and quickly. So, we actually really haven't seen anything material, if you will. Obviously, we compete with them particularly in some parts of Latin America. We had a strong second quarter and continue to have to do well as we're into July and we actually haven't seen anything what I'd call material changes. Those kinds of fluctuations market-by-market, city-by-city but nothing and nothing that I could attach to the broader question surrounding duty. Nelson Chai : Next question, please. Operator : Next question is from Brad Erickson from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brad Erickson : Hi, there. Thanks for taking the questions. Just one more on the driver incentives. Can you just talk about the confidence level that you can continue to taper here? I think your main competitor here in the U.S., they're going to keep those investment levels fairly high for the foreseeable future. And so I guess I'm just wondering how conservative are your expectations there as we look at what's contemplated into the Q4 guide and the profit target? And then the second one is, just can you remind us just what's built-in also for that profit target regarding advertising? Thanks. Nelson Chai : So, there isn't much more from a run rate standpoint on advertising. It's really coming from Mobility recovery. And so, if you listen to my commentary, I really did center it and the variability is really around the Mobility recovery or the continue to recovery. We did notice that lifted increase some of their incentive spend both in June but particularly in July and as you heard from our commentary based on the results in July, our business is quite strong and our margins have come back. And again as I reiterated a few times on this call already. And as we think about getting to the guidance that we gave you, it's really around not increasing our take rates if you will, between now and the end of the quarter. It's just maintaining where they were today if in this at this point of time in Q3 and then some expected increase on the volume side. So, again, obviously, we can't predict the future, but we feel pretty good about what's going on now and it's happening today in the marketplace where they are investing. As Dara mentioned, we invested early and often to build back our marketplace. And you do get the benefits of the flywheel. You did hear my comments about in July, how we had a 30% new drivers without really incremental or spent incrementalized we're spending a lot more in incentive. And so we just got about the flywheel going and we're getting the benefits from it. I'm not going to comment on what listed and we're not going to do. But again, we feel pretty comfortable for our marketplaces today. Dara Khosrowshahi : And I think the other factor that I would also point out, Brad, is the incentives was the fastest lever that we could pull, but the improvements that we have made in terms of onboarding flow, the CRM campaigns that we're sending to resurrected drivers. We've done a bunch of testing and learning in terms of one incentives work in which ones don't, all of that is resulting in greater efficiency in terms of our being able to add incremental drivers at a lower cost in our being able to hold onto drivers because earnings are really high. The other factor that I would add is that again based on what we can see our spend versus Lyft spend, our base we went to more aggressively. So, I think that when we say we can taper it's off of a more aggressive base. And if they're putting in incentives, it's probably off of a lower base. So, there may not be that much of a difference, but the biggest factor is, we now have the machine working, and listen in July, we pull back incentives and drive our acquisition and courier acquisition look really, really strong. So, all we're giving you is the facts and our capabilities are getting better. And we're getting smarter about how we're spending and that's what gives us a lot of confidence going into Q3 and Q4. Brad Erickson : Great. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Operator : Here your next question is from Edward Yruma from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Edward Yruma : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question about reward. I know you guys continue to innovate the program. I guess how successful have you been in terms of driving incremental usage either on the East side or on the Ride side, more importantly getting a consumer to use both sides to be app. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. So, on average the past customer is the number of trips Rides and food orders per customer on a monthly basis increases more than 50% on pre-past, post half. So, that included incrementality is pretty significant. We see a lot more crossover and if you look at our supplemental slides the percentage of our total gross bookings now coming from Mobility and Delivery cross-platform users is close to 50% in the US and the UK as well. So, the path is really working and the most important factor on the path is that 98% retention rate. It's a really strong product that's sticky and that gives us the confidence to be able to lean in and grow the number of Pass members that we got. Edward Yruma : Got it. And do you think that that helps keep the customer loyal to your platform versus shopping our other platforms from a price perspective? Dara Khosrowshahi : It's certainly shows up in the orders per month. It's our belief that it's not purely priced. We really invest in the customer service there certainly savings but listen, this is a well-worn path Amazon Prime. I think touched talked a bunch of players after the value of high-frequency type of interactions. And we're not inventing anything here. The good news for us is our Pass structurally because of the Delivery benefits, because of the Ride benefits, now because of the grocery benefits just structurally our Pass can offer more than any other Pass out there and the upside that we can see from frequency is just structurally higher than any other player out there. So, we think our Pass is the upside from it in terms of our business and the retention just a structurally different place versus any of our competitors. Edward Yruma : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from Tom White of DA Davidson. Your line is open. Tom White : Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. Just hoping you could comment maybe on your expectation we're staying EBITDA profitable after the fourth quarter and maybe whether you really think you should, and I guess specifically, I'm talking about growing businesses and grocery and other Delivery categories. How you're thinking about when you're investing in those long-term very large opportunities versus kind of catered to public equity investors? I would like to see some near-term profitable. Nelson Chai : So, Tom when we talk about getting the EBITDA profitability in Q4, our expectation is that will continue and they'll be sustainable and growing, as we continue to move forward into 2022. So, we believe we'll have enough to invest along some of those other new verticals in other areas and reinvest back in. But we recognize the fact that one of the things we did, if you think about the approach like this quarter we invested ahead up our healthy marketplace. So, we can go given coverage to get our margins back. Have our business is healthy and growing and profitable as we move towards EBITDA profitability. That's pretty important for the company and for Dara from myself that we just sustainably build our business and continue to grow our bottom line as well. Dara Khosrowshahi : Hey, Tom, just mathematically. The other factor that I would point to is our Mobility business is a $50 plus billion run rate via COVID and we're seeing a number of markets back above a 100% of 2019 levels. At $50 billion the Mobility margins as a percentage of gross bookings can be 10% and already is 10% at a bunch of market. So, the earning power today with our kind of growth on our Mobility business is really, it's a $5 billion earnings power today. Delivery business, we have markets that are 5% of gross bookings today. So, the earnings power of that business is another $2.5 billion. Our earning overheads, it's, call it $2 billion on a run-rate basis. So, the earnings power of this Company is very, very significant that allows us to invest in new businesses. It allows us to invest in new verticals, high capacity vehicles, tool, rental, reserve, it allows us to invest in grocery, et cetera. And because of the scale of our business and because of the membership program et cetera, that they talked about, we can invest aggressively and we can be EBITDA profitable and we expect to increased margins for the foreseeable future. And in a tough way COVID kind of prepared us for this, we have to sharpen our kind of operating muscles. But this is not raise the profitability. And then I'm going to go, where we're going to do. This is a race, the profitability and just keep growing and growing and growing. That is absolutely our goal. And I think we got the earnings power to do it. Tom White : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from Steven Fox from Fox Advisors. Your line is open Steven Fox : Hi, thanks, good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could follow up on a couple of comments that one in particular, as well as the comment about being practical when considering category expansion in the US, it seems like category expansion has a better return on your investment and you could be aggressive while still protecting profit. So any longer term thoughts on how to think of not just groceries, but also the Drizly acquisition coming in other categories as you invest in the next year. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, I think on the long term I just point to Uber right look, this is not made up theories right we built, we were late in the Delivery game, we built up Uber Eats using the engineering platform that we built on Mobility putting a bunch of our great product people engineers against that we've built up Freight organically, we're making a big acquisition, but that's another business that we built Grocery and Drizly are very, very close to our Delivery business in terms of use cases. They cover the fast and frequent, people want there liquor fast, they want grocery fast and they're also frequent use cases as well. So we are going to use the family of apps that we have to essentially cross promote one service to the other at the right time targeted to the right person using ML algorithms, so I'll have the same identity. They have the same payment characteristics will have fraud engines routing engines pricing inches all of them running against the bigger dataset than anyone else can. So just if this is a play that we've run a bunch of times and we're very, very confident that we can do the same for grocery and other categories as well. Steven Fox : Great. And just to clarify, you said. These new categories of 5% to 6% of Delivery booking bookings, or total company bookings, I want to clear on that. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Delivery booking. Steven Fox : Thanks very much. Operator : Next question is from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Just two quick ones, one just, how are you thinking if unemployment benefits are extended, would that change your 3rd quarter outlook, and the number two, I think kind of SoftBank's position in your stock has been closing headache for many? Any thoughts about how that could get resolved. Thanks. Nelson Chai : Well, so first of all, in terms of our guidance is really just based on what we think is going to happen to the extent benefits are, we will manage it. But as you know we've made really good strides right now in the current environment and with the current plans in place. So no, we don't see any changes irrespective of benefits get extended or not. We do see benefit in terms of folks coming back to drive when the benefits do expire. But that's more of an upside, if you will, in terms of SoftBank it's hard for me to comment on SoftBank there. We have good relationship with them, they an investor, there's lots of stuff you read About what they're doing regarding some of their holdings, particularly given what's going on in China. I think much of it is done already. But again they don't really call us for advice on how they're going to trade, and what they're going to go do, but again I think we're fine with whatever they and doing so. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Nikhil Devnani from Bernstein. Your line is open. Nikhil Devnani : Hi, thanks for taking my question. A couple if I may. First in the markets where you've invested aggressively and you've seen driver supply improve. Could you see market share gains. Follow again either competitors or alternatives in those regions. And then secondly, in terms of the users that you're adding any way to dimension how many of these are new to Uber altogether or just older users reactivating. Thank you. Nelson Chai : Just so in terms of the supply question again. Yes, there is nothing in terms of are we gaining our -- what I would say is our category -- we call our category position you got, call it, market share, it's very healthy and actually ever the region of our Mobility businesses and it's either been stable to where it was in Q1 or has improved a slightly in every major market and again it, whether it's, it has to do with investment on bringing drivers back or just the competitive nature of the marketplaces or other factors that it's, it is what it is. I can't draw a conclusion between them between different marketplaces. The team is actually doing quite well, executing given the pandemic and people coming back. Dara Khosrowshahi : So what was your second question, I'm sorry, I missed it. Nikhil Devnani : No worries. Second question is just on the users in app fee growth, any way to dimension, how many of these are new users to Uber altogether, how many are just reactivating old users? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I think the majority of both our driver growth and new user growth tends to come from resurrection, again, we got the deepest database that any company has, so we can reach into that database and when we reach into that database with essentially CRM campaigns. So it's a very, very cheap to bring back those resurrecting drivers. The second most significant area of growth is essentially the rides business there on Eats and then now the Eats business actually throwing to rides and mixing new customers, essentially that don't use the other product. And then the third channel is essentially new customers to the platform itself, so it's in that order and listen, we have active we have active initiatives in all three and we can always do better, but certainly the momentum that we're seeing is as positive in all three Balaji Krishnamurthy : Operator, we have time for one more question. Nikhil Devnani : Got it. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Let's take the last. Operator : Your last thank you. Your last question is from Youssef Squali from Truist Securities. Your line is open. Youssef Squali : Great, thank you very much. I have one question for Dara and one question for Nelson. Dara, can you maybe speak to the driver supply driver supply and incentives in states that have ended federal unemployment benefits recently versus those that did not. How much of maybe the pullback that you're seeing and maybe at least partially driven by that. And then, Nelson with profitability, couple of quarters away now literally around the corner. Can you maybe revisit long-term margins of the business across both Rides and Eats that you've shared with us pre-COVID arguably obviously you're in a much, much better financial situation with all the cost savings et cetera. So obviously ex grocery ex-free to the areas still investment, if you could maybe just provide some color on that, that'd be great. Nelson Chai : So I'll go first. We are updating any of our long-term margins today. We want to get through the pandemic and come out and then we understand that it is something that investors want. And so we will address that in that shortly after. And I think Dara gave you had a very high level. The math as you went through it and he used as a percent of GB's and 10% of Gross Bookings for Mobility and 5% for Delivery; and so I can't suggest not a good guide guidepost. But again, we will formally, take a look at it as we get through the pandemic, we wanted to do is just make sure we navigated the recovery is going on, particularly in terms of creating equilibrium on our marketplace, which is what we've been able to do and here through Q2 and starting to see the benefits in Q3. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, I think Youssef, to your question on driver incentives. We have been leaning into driver incentives broadly in Q2, we have been able to pull back from driver incentives broadly in Q3. And we have been able to continue to acquire and/or resurrect new drivers broadly in July, even as we pull back incentives just because the machinery and the targeting is working so much better. In states that have ended UI, our marketplace balance in general is in a much healthier condition than states that have not ended the UI. There is additional factor that's coming in the Delta-variant now which may throw things off but it does seem to be a positive to us, we don't know if it's because the UI or other factors. But it seems positive and our driving -- kind of driver incentive efficiency improvements has happened in states where UI has ended as well as states where UI continues. Youssef Squali : Okay, thank you both. Dara Khosrowshahi : You bet. Balaji Krishnamurthy : We can wrap it up guys. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right, thank you everyone for joining us. And lot of hard work from the team in Q2, and we see some pretty positive signals as it relates to Q3 and Q4. So, thanks very much for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Lastly, we ask you to review our earnings press release for a detailed Q3 financial review, and our Q3 Supplemental Slides deck for a number of additional disclosures that provide context on recent business performance. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Balaji. Over the last few quarters, we've focused on achieving two things. First, we've worked hard to get Uber firing on all cylinders again, driving recovery for Mobility, continued growth for Delivery and scaling our momentum with freight. Second, we've been disciplined in our execution to ensure growth is sustainably profitable, and that we live up to our commitment to shareholders. Our results this quarter demonstrate the incredible progress we've made against these objectives. Reaching total company adjusted EBITDA profitability is an important milestone. And one that's even more impressive when you consider where we were as a company just 18 months ago. In Q3, our mobile - our Mobility business delivered margins consistent with 2019 highs. Meanwhile, our global Delivery business nearly reached breakeven. In the US and Canada, our multiquarter investment cycle and strong execution by our Delivery team resulted in us, both gaining category's share and improving profitability with adjusted EBITDA growing more than $130 million quarter-on-quarter to approach breakeven. Today's profitability milestone is an important step, but it's just a step. When it comes to delivering on our mission and building a generational company, we know that profitability is a means, not an end. We remain focused on generating positive free cash flow, while also making disciplined investments to appropriately fund growth initiatives that will carry us into the future. Uber is at the center of multiple massive opportunities and Mobility, Delivery and Logistics and our platform is stronger than ever before. I want to take a minute to update you on our driver and courier recruitment efforts before turning to demand recovery, and then a bit on our long-term growth plans. When we first saw demand beginning to outstrip supply in Q2, we made a conscious decision to invest fast and to invest aggressively in attracting drivers back to Uber with a focus on the US. The results are clear, we've seen 10 consecutive weeks of active driver growth in the US, resulting in a far better rider experience. The number of active drivers is up more than 65% since January, and more than 20% since June. As a result, the incidence of surge pricing has fallen by nearly half and wait times are now below the magic 5 minute mark on average. We did this while meaningfully reducing incentive levels and at the same time, driver earnings remained near all-time highs due to increased utilization. We've also continued to grow the number of couriers on Eats in the US with active couriers up 80% since January and 25% since June. In other words, not only are we approaching our supply and demand balance for Mobility in the US, we've done so while nearly doubling our Delivery courier base from its low in Q1. All-in-all, our monthly active driver and courier base in the US has grown by nearly 640,000 since January. Against a backdrop of historic labor shortages and an abundance of choice for workers is a strong endorsement of Uber's value and the value of independent, flexible work. In a world where flexibility has increasingly become non-negotiable for workers across the economy, we believe Uber will be an even more attractive option going forward. We've now shifted to hyper-targeted driver growth campaigns geared towards particular markets, all the way down to specific neighborhoods and times of day. We're also focused on tech improvements that increase signup rates, combining our onboarding process across Mobility and Delivery. So individuals can sign up for both simultaneously, and can start delivering while they're waiting to be approved to drive. This is a unique advantage available only to Uber, which has resulted in a 20% to 40% increase in courier and driver activation rates. We expect to roll out this feature as widely as possible in the coming months. In some non-US markets like the UK and Brazil, the driver base is back to roughly the same size as it was pre-COVID. But it still hasn't kept up with very strong demand which has grown past 2019 levels. That said, we're comfortable that the bulk of our recruitment spending is behind us. And that by taking learnings from the US and applying them abroad, we can be much more efficient and effective in our approach. Now, a bit on demand recovery. After a period of soft demand driven by the Delta variant, the Mobility recovery has reignited with Mobility gross bookings expanding 18% over September - over the September and October period. While several markets around the world, including UK, Brazil, Germany, Spain, Taiwan and Hong Kong are up against 2019. We hit another milestone last week, our global Mobility business posted its first few days of growth versus 2019. In fact, this year's Halloween weekend eclipsed 2019, demonstrating consumers' excitement to get out and move again. We believe volumes will return to trend line outside of holiday periods, but the underlying trend line continues to get better and better. Notably, airports are beginning to show meaningful activity. With US airport trips up more than 20% and business airport trips growing nearly 60% over the past two months. We're innovating into this demand with a series of product updates geared towards airports, including the ability to book a car with Uber Reserve, up to 30 days in advance, with built-in flight tracking so your ride is ready for you whether you're early, delayed or hopefully on time. Meanwhile, we've continued to see sustained consumer engagement on Delivery, lending further support to our belief that increased demand for all types of fast delivery is structural and will grow for the foreseeable future. Over the past two months, Delivery gross bookings have grown 8% despite reopenings around the world. While Delivery saw some summer seasonality in parts of Europe, trends have stabilized and even return to modest growth in those markets. Even as cities got moving again, Delivery gross bookings posted yet another best week ever last week. In fact, we set a new best week ever for weekly totally company gross bookings in seven of the last eight weeks, and October was our best month in our 12-year history, thanks to the work of all of Uber team members. Looking ahead, it's our goal to grow both our top line and our bottom line and healthy, consistent and sustainable rates. That means being flawless in our execution and disciplined with our capital allocation for the large opportunities in front of us across Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Our Mobility team is raring to go. While the team has appropriately managed cost through the crisis. Our Mobility team has been seeding growth opportunities in five areas, low cost product, category expansion, hailables, enterprise and further geographic expansion. We believe that the underlying growth characteristics of on-demand Mobility and our growth bets can sustain double-digit growth for multiple years, while creating more opportunities for drivers. On low cost, we've begun to test a reimagined Shared Rides product with a focus on safety. Uber Reserve is a great expansion of our category from on-demand to advanced booking and is now live in 68 countries and is already tracking well ahead of our expectations. We're bringing more traditional street-hail modes like taxis and motorbikes onto Uber, allowing us to expand into new geos, offer another choice to riders and generate more demand for drivers. On Enterprise, we've begun to roll out an employee shuttle product using Uber's tech that our B2B sales team can plug into our corporate discussions. It's a very cool product, it's already rolled out for Uber. And our geographic expansion continues with growth markets like Germany and Spain showing real momentum and the bookings already 40% larger than they were in October 2019. It's important to note that we've been investing in these growth opportunities for years in some cases. So we are not running here from a standing start. Our Delivery business is even less penetrated and although there will be some moderation in growth compared to the last 18 months. We expect continued strong growth in the years ahead, from both our core restaurant Delivery business and our emerging new verticals business. As cities reopen, we're seeing evidence that Delivery complements dine-in, as third-party food Delivery has continued to grow even a seated dining trends have fully recovered to 2019 levels. As the largest Food Delivery platform outside of China, with the leading position in seven of our top countries and a second position in virtually all the rest, we believe that we are best positioned to tap into this opportunity. Outside Food Delivery, we're increasingly tapping into consumers' growing appetite for the on-demand delivery of, well, everything. Today, we're focused on addressing grocery, convenience and alcohol through our marketplace, bolstered by the addition of Cornershop and most recently Drizly to the Uber platform. In addition, with Uber Direct, we're working with retailers to fulfill demand from their own channels in a white-label product that uses our Delivery tech. All of our consumer initiatives will be underpinned by our membership program. We built a good foundation with Uber Pass and Eats Pass, and recently announced a strong partnership with Hulu and Aeroplan, while further deepening our engagement with American Express. Our team has been hard at work on the next evolution of our membership plan and stay tuned for more news on that in the coming months. Lastly, with Freight. We see a massive opportunity to disrupt the freight brokerage industry with our technology, which now connects more than 1 million carriers to shippers. This year, we've seen a record number of newly authorized carriers entering the market of 3x versus the end of 2020, as more drivers are choosing to become owner-operators. As one of the leading choices for these new carriers. Freight's total carrier base has grown almost 50% over last year. We're also looking forward to closing our acquisition of Transplace in Q4 as we move towards a vision of connecting first, mid and last-mile logistics across the Uber platform. It was a great quarter, and one that should put to rest the many questions we've gotten, not always unfairly, about whether the unit economics of this business work. The answer is a resounding yes. But as I've said to the team, now the real work begins. Looking ahead, as we've done in the past, we'll continue to make investments that will set us up to succeed in the next frontiers of opportunity and deliver exceptional value to all of our stakeholders. Now, over to Nelson. Nelson Chai : Thanks, Dara. We've consistently noted throughout the year that H1 would be a period of investing for recovery and growth, after which, we would demonstrate strong operating leverage in H2. In Q3, we delivered on our commitment to turn adjusted EBITDA profitable for the end of 2021. Our Mobility business returned to healthy adjusted EBITDA margins despite the significant ongoing headwinds of the pandemic, while Delivery approached breakeven. Across our markets, we continue to see very healthy profitability trends that bolster our confidence in the long-term earnings potential for our business. For Mobility, 18 of our top 20 markets were adjusted EBITDA profitable. In the US and Canada, our adjusted EBITDA margins expanded to more than 6% of gross bookings. And importantly, in 4 of our top 10 markets were operating above 10% EBITDA margins. For Delivery, our international and US and Canada businesses were both operating near breakeven in Q3. In addition, the core Uber Eats restaurant delivery business was adjusted EBITDA profitable during the quarter, and we reinvested all of that profitability and more to build the foundation for our New Verticals business. We expect to continue to reinvest the vast majority of EBIT - Uber Eats profits into New Verticals expansion in Q4 as well. We are confident that we will see strong returns on these investments over time. It is important to emphasize the strong execution that underpins these results. As several transitory headwinds continue to impact our business, including Food Delivery commission caps in the US and Canada, incremental costs of worker classification in the UK, and higher than normal driver incentives spend in some markets. For context, Food Delivery commission caps and UK worker costs together represented $150 million to $200 million drag to Q3 EBITDA. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position, we continue to maintain a strong liquidity position ending the quarter with $6.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and our equity stakes were marked at $13.1 billion. Given the significant movement of Didi's stock from June 30 to September 30, we marked down the value of our Didi stake by $3.2 billion. Conversely, we benefited from the moment - monetization of our Yandex Taxi stake and we marketed the value of our stakes in Zomato, Aurora and Joby as these companies reached liquidity milestones. The net effect of these moves was a $2 billion headwind to our GAAP net income. It's the nature of holding large equity stakes on our balance sheet that our GAAP net income may continue to see swings from quarter-to-quarter. As we have said previously, we are not a fund manager, and we will monetize the stakes with you as purely financial at the appropriate time. While continuing to hold more strategic stakes for the long run. We have sufficient liquidity to give us the flexibility to maintain these positions with the aim of maximizing value for Uber and our shareholders. I'll conclude my remarks with an update on recent business trends and Q4 outlook. After a relatively soft summer, we began to make strong progress in the fall as markets around the world began to open again. Mobility gross bookings crossed a $44 billion annual run rate in October with gross bookings up 14% month-over-month and over 85% recovered - versus October of 2019. The EMEA and LatAm remained near full recovery on the gross bookings basis versus October 2019, while US, Canada and APAC posted solid improvements through the month. Delivery gross bookings crossed the $53 billion annual run rate in October, with gross bookings up 9% month-over-month, up 44% year-over-year and up over 220% versus October of 2019. We continue to expect moderation in Deliver year-over-year growth rates from the reopening, although Delivery continues to demonstrate healthy trend lines across most markets and retention for our consumer cohorts remained strong. With that context for Q4, we expect total company gross bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 46% to 52%. And we expect total company adjusted EBITDA to be a profit between $25 million and $75 million. Note, that this guidance includes contributions from Drizly and projected contributions and Transplace which we expect to close in Q4, and headwinds from FX and the net effect of a relatively immaterial impact to total company gross bookings and adjusted EBITDA. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Dara curious just to hear about what you learned about pricing elasticity on rideshare sort of throughout the pandemic and the recovery and pricing and how should we think about the rides' incremental margin potential as we sort of go forward and you sort of balance profitability with those five key areas of investment? Then the second one, sounds like there's an update to Uber Pass coming, did any numbers at all, you can help us sort of understand where you are now within size, what type of uptick do you see in volume or frequency or stickiness as any stats on Uber Pass right now? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, absolutely, Brian. So I think as far as pricing goes, listen, this has been, to some extent, a giant pricing experiment that no one wanted to get into. But we're seeing the value of our products show through and you know even with prices being on average in the US, for example, 20% up year-on-year, we're seeing that as cities reopen, people start using the product, and they use their product a lot. In terms of use cases, you know, weekend is actually now at greater than what it was pre-pandemic. And airports, obviously, because the travel there is coming back fast. But like every single use case is coming back as expected, there are no surprises. And I think it shows the pricing power of our service. And the fact that it's an everyday need, and just part of you know, both now, urban and suburban life as well. We do think that based on the supply trends that we've seen and supply trends are definitely getting better. We do think that pricing will ease a bit from the up 20% in Q4. But I think that'll result in even healthier trip volume as well. Nelson Chai : And Brian, the only thing I want to jump in there is that, as you know, because, you know, we get a commission on that as pricing increases, it's been beneficial. But I think ours right over time, the long-term things just making sure we have health in our marketplace. Dara Khosrowshahi : And I think as far as Uber Pass goes, I don't want to take the thunder away from the team who's done a bunch of work. You know, membership now we got over 6 million members globally, it accounts for more than 20% of our gross bookings, we think all of those numbers can increase pretty significantly. We continue to see really good engagement from members on the Eats side Eats members, their trips per month increased by over 50%. Members versus non-members, even basket sizes are higher, basket sizes are up versus non-members, in average of 10%. When you look at kind of the potential of membership, because we are launching in and a ton of markets all over, I would point to one market, Taiwan, where members account for greater than 50% of gross bookings. So we absolutely believe we can get there. And members now in Taiwan are eating with us 15 times per month, which is 3x non-members. So that's the kind of engagement that you can start getting with a service that becomes an everyday part of your use case. And I think we're just scratching the surface here. We're very, very early in our development here. And remember, that we have the best membership content so to speak, than anyone has, because our membership will offer not only food, not only grocery and alcohol, but is also going to offer Mobility as well. It's a structural advantage that others just don't have access to and I think one that we're going to press. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks, Dara. Thanks, Nelson. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe following up on the point you made answering Brian's question. Can we just get a better sense of what you're seeing early days in terms of the opportunity set versus the addressable market in non-Food Delivery in the US and how we should be thinking about the sizing and cadence of those investments going forward when you measure them against the opportunity? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, absolutely. So I think as far as non-food goes, you know, grocery is - Online Grocery Delivery clearly has been a very, very growth area and industry. And certainly with a pandemic took a very, very big jump. But when you look at online grocery penetration, it's still less than 5% of the overall grocery market versus food which often is more than 10% penetrated. So the penetration of grocery is very, very low as it relates to food. I'd say our opportunity is actually you know, we have a big incumbent in the US is a tough competitor and we are adding content in the US at a really strong pace in terms of partnerships. But outside of the US, there certainly isn't an incumbent out there. We think that we have a very, very good chance of being non-food leader outside of the US and the US because of the power of the platform, we can over a long period of time, flip over especially our members from delivering you know from eating with us, from moving with us and then getting grocery delivered with us as well. So we think it's a huge opportunity, the grocery markets as you know, these are multibillion/trillion dollar TAMs and because of our brand, because of our ubiquitous presence around the globe, and our membership product, we think we can penetrate into this opportunity with much, much less capital than anyone else. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open. Dara Khosrowshahi : Hi, Ross - Ross Sandler : Only two questions here. Hey, guys. The Halloween comment's pretty interesting. That's historically one of the biggest, if not the biggest Friday update of the year or weekend. So, I guess, where do you stand on the rides MAPCs versus 2019? And is it just the frequency lower for some of these work and commute day parts? Could you talk about how far off those day parts or those trips are those categories from 2019 peak levels? And then the second question is, if we step back and kind of look at the original bull case for ride hailing, it was that you know, prices would come down to low enough level where consumers start to shift trips over to ride hail and away from public transportation or car ownership. And right now these price is pretty hard to see not playing out. So how do we get back to that? And if we do see much lower prices a few years out, you know, how confident are you that you can maintain the strong level of unit economics you're seeing right now? Thanks a lot. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, absolutely. So, I think generally MAPCs now in the US are up about 60%, over 60% on a year-on-year basis. So MAPCs are definitely coming back, frequencies coming back and volume is coming back year-on-year. You are correct that, if you look at our trends versus call a pre-pandemic GBs are recovered at a higher level than trips. And I'd say that, the MAPC trends mirror more our trip trends than our GB trends. I think in terms of kind of pricing and the shift over from other forms of transportation, one point I'll make is that, we have come back from the pandemic faster than almost any other mode of transportation, despite higher pricing, which goes to the earlier comment that I made about the utility of our product and the pricing power that we've had. Now, we don't necessarily want that to be a permanent fixture. But I do think with the increased cost of labor, and frankly, inflation and the increased cost of everything, I do think that prices are going to be up on a year-on-year basis. And as a marketplace, you know, we get to take up that. So our unit economics you could argue will be improved. We are then actively investing in other products that are structurally lower cost. So, we will, we are launching an Uber Shared Pool product. We have been investing for years in a high capacity product, which is looking more and more attractive as it relates on a unit economic basis where that can bring the price significantly lower. We think that's a product that we can sell to enterprise which is pretty cool as well. And then on a global basis, we're making investments in two wheelers and three wheelers for example. So for example, in Brazil, two wheelers are just a homerun hit, because again, they provide an alternative at a lower cost is a great opportunity for drivers and they don't have to buy a car, they have to have a motorbike. So I think that push to lower cost is going to be more of a structural product push, including, for example, our offering transit on our app. And I think as it relate to pricing, you know, inflation is hitting in every single product and transportation is one of those products. Nelson Chai : The only thing I want to add is, because you did ask about the times a day. So, on a global basis I think you heard in our comments that we're about 85% recovered in October. And so, we're during workday, which define it as you know, as you can figure out we're over 95% recovered. On commute, we're over 90% recovered but we really haven't seen a comeback still is, you know airports continue to lag at about you know 67% recovered. So we are seeing the recovery. But there are certain times a day and what we call party and fun times as well is under 80% recovered as well. Ross Sandler : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open. Michael McGovern : Hey, thanks for taking our question. This is Mike on for Justin. We want to ask about the category share trends that you're seeing in Delivery, especially in the US, maybe in October and your willingness to potentially invest in gaining category share. And then quick second question, we want to ask about the advertising business and the impact that that's had on the Delivery take rate. I think you called out 400 basis point benefit in certain Delivery markets for the take rates. I was wondering does that include advertising or could you dig into that metric a little bit? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, I'll talk category trends, and then Nelson can talk about ads. Listen, as far as category trends go, you know we're much more focused internally on building our business in the US. So I think it's a great output that we're able to improve profitability significantly in the US and globally. And we gained CPE in the US, it's terrific output like we're seeing great signal in New York, for example, where we're actually calling in front - calling in from. And I'd say that Q4 opportunity for us is, now that we have much, much better supply, both on Mobility and Delivery, as it relates to drivers and couriers. I think on the Delivery side, we may lean in a little bit to build up a better demand in Q4. So that's contemplated in the guidance that we gave already, will be opportunistic. But this is a big category, there are going to be multiple winners. And you know, we're happy about our share progress, it's pretty constructive. And hopefully, we'll continue into Q4, but it's about building a big business. It's not about you know, stealing share from another player. Nelson Chai : Yeah, in terms of ads, you know, in Q2 we talked about the fact that our original goal was to exit this year at about $100 million growth rate and be in '22 at $300 million. And so what I would say is our run rate in Q3 is well over that. So you know, what I - so we're very, very confident that we'll exceed both of those targets, the business continues to grow. I think your specific comment had to do with take rates. And so the only other thing, it's actually in our release and it just talks about a change in some fees that now come out become part across the revenue versus below the line. And so that does have some impact, and it is actually spelled out in our release. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think just the other really cool thing about our ad platform is that, we're also building an ad product in our Mobility app. So obviously, it's a very, very big audience as you know, our Mobility MAPCs are actually bigger than our Delivery MAPCs. And it's - really it's a differentiated offering that we can offer to our partners, who, you know, as you know, obviously, they're very happy about home delivery food, but they want people coming to their restaurants, they want people coming to their stores. And we have an audience that is a premium audience, and can be quite a targeted audience that we can offer to these advertisers in a very differentiated product from any other player out there. All right, next question. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Dara Khosrowshahi : Hi, Mark. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thanks. Two things. One, comment on the synergies between the two business Delivery and Mobility both on the Driver side and on the consumer side, any update there? And then just on the driver incentives, I think that peak quarter was Q2 just talk about where and maybe you mentioned this earlier, but just an update on where those driver incentives, what happened to them Q2 to Q3? And is the outlook that you're at a point now where those will steadily continue to decline under most market circumstances? Thanks a lot. Nelson Chai : So let me take the second one - second question first, right. And so this is really about take rate. And so, as you think about in the US, we did lean in, which was actually very evident in Q2. What we're going to - you'll see in Q4 is that, you should actually see take rate improve in the US, because we are going to be able to continue to taper in terms of some driver incentives. That being said, Mark in outside the US on the Mobility side, international take rates are seasonally lower in Q4 due to weather and we actually are leaning in a little bit more in driver supply, particularly at some places like India and Australia recover, and I think the net of all that will be a mix shift and so you might see some degradation at the total company level on the top line. But again in the US you will see improvement in terms of our US take rate. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, Mark in terms of synergy, it's obviously we have user side synergy and call it, earner side synergy. And the synergy, it continues to improve. It's not a one-time thing like we're constantly optimizing. So about 50% of, for example, US and UK, gross bookings come from cross platform users, that number is closer to 45% globally and generally increasing. In the US now, Mobility continues to be a very significant customer acquisition tool for Eats. So now a quarter of US first-time eaters are coming from our rides business, which is pretty extraordinary. For prospective, that's more new users than we get from Google, Apple, Facebook, Instagram, from all of these paid entities combined. So it's free. We have tested that because it's, you know, consumers actually like this super app that we're building. And the numbers are significant and increasing. And then on the other side, what's interesting is that, 20% of US Mobility first trips are coming from eaters. So now that we have a very, very big delivery business, we're able to now cross platform into whether it's off for us or on the app or off the app, we're able to promote into our Mobility business. That number for the UK, for example, is 40%. I'll repeat it, 40% of UK first trip Mobility users actually came from Eats were Eats users, which is pretty extraordinary. So we just have this cross kind of pollenization of users that's pretty extraordinary. And listen, in any one year, it's not going to make a giant different in the business. But it's a compounding of this advantage of essentially free traffic for both our Mobility and Delivery business, that over a period of you know, five to seven years, becomes very, very significant. And it can either show up in margin or it can show up on share, or it can show up in the size of the business. On the driver side, one thing that's pretty cool is that, about a third of our new driver signups now are driving both people and food, so to speak. And that is a higher number than our overall number. So about 25% of our drivers in the US drive both people and food. That number was in the teens pre-pandemic. So it's going up from the teens to 25% overall, and new drivers, a third of them are electing to do both. So that again is like the iteration of a product getting better and better in terms of kind of pushing both services or offering both services, both on the demand and supply side. So we're not done. I think you will see improved results compounding on top and improved results which is definitely going to differentiate us over a period of time. Mark Mahaney : Thanks, Dara. Thanks, Nelson. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Thank you. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. John Byun : Hi, Great, thanks very much. This is John Byun for Brent Thill. I had two questions. One is could maybe give an update on the operational integration of you know Drizly, Postmates, Cornershop. You know, just in general, the acquisitions and partnerships in the geographic availability, how far along you're on? And the second on the Delivery bookings were flat to down a little bit quarter-on-quarter, you know, there was some commentary in the release, but is there anything else you could share to why they might be the seasonal, is it quarterly reopening? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, I think I'll start with Delivery. It's a combination of seasonality and reopening. So for example, in France, we did see Delivery bookings coming down. As you know, summer months came and summer months people eat out more and the reopening happened. We're seeing in October Delivery bookings up month-on-month, and we think that the momentum that we're seeing in October is going to continue into Q4 as well. So it's a combination of seasonality and reopening [technical difficulty] a very, very strong track. As far as the integration goes, you know, every integration is different. Postmates is now fully integrated into the Uber Stack. So on the front end it's a product that is distinctive, fun, different in terms of the brand on the back end it's running on all of the same machinery, which has allowed us to get some great synergies and Postmates, for example, for the quarter was EBITDA positive, as a result of the product synergy that we drove. As it relates to Cornershop, Cornershop has a huge presence in Latin America. So, you know, Cornershop is like the Instacart of LatAm. And so we're going to keep pushing in terms of innovating on the Cornershop app itself. And we are essentially continuing to build a bunch of the grocery features on - in the Eats app and in the Delivery ecosystem, and over a period of time going to bring essentially our Eats and Cornershop business together. But the Cornershop business on standalone is a really, really great business. And we want to make sure that we keep growing that business. And then with Drizly. We're going to keep Drizly relatively standalone. I think listen, integration and you know innovation, I think to some extent cut against each other. Drizly is in the very, very, very early stages of development, there's a ton of growth ahead of Drizly coming out. And as a result, that team is going to be operating largely standalone, but will benefit from front end cross promotion from our, definitely our Eats business, you see more of a presence in Eats app as it relates to The Liquor Vertical. Nelson Chai : And the only thing I would add is that, when we made the Postmates acquisition, we talked about synergies. And so we've actually realized the synergies that we mentioned at the time of acquisition. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, great job to the team on the integration side. Nelson Chai : We can take the next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Edward Yruma : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. You indicated, I guess some contexts behind the headwinds due to the fee caps and the UK worker roles. I'm just trying to say in the medium-term, do you need to seek regulatory relief to improve those? Or do you think that there are pricing mechanisms or other ways for you to alleviate some of the pressure you know from some of these gains? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : So I think on the regulatory front, listen, there's we're certainly not counting as it relates to our go-forward numbers in Q4 or next year, the regulatory environment changing it's, you know, we're kind of predicting the environment that we operate in. We think that from a regulatory standpoint, you know, fee caps are poor regulation. And essentially, they force us to increase costs to eaters, and they don't make sense from a regulatory standpoint that they're, you know, we think illegal, and we will challenge them appropriately. But I do think that as far as our plans go, we're not counting on regulatory relief there. Edward Yruma : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Next question. Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the question. So the first one, I think you noted that EMEA and LatAm, have almost fully recovered on Mobility business in October. Can you give some color on the marketplace dynamics in these regions between pricing and volumes? Also I mean, clearly, not all the use cases in these regions have probably fully recovered, but wondering where you see the incremental usage up in these regions? And then second question, can you give some additional color on what we should expect on EBITDA trends between the two businesses separately like rides share need for 4Q, I know there are some seasonality in 4Q rice take rates. But how should we think about EBITDA? Thank you. Nelson Chai : So I'll handle the second question first, and Dara will do the other one. So, you know, in terms of the EBITDA, as you know, the Mobility business continued and had a really great quarter from a bottom line perspective. And I think you heard in my prepared remarks that in places like the US and Canada, where we achieved 6% of EBITDA as a percent of gross bookings, and the fact that 4 of our top 10 marketplaces are actually above 10%. And so I think what you'll see is, you'll see to continue that business continuing to improve. As I said in my remarks around Delivery, we went from a significant loss in Q2 to almost close to breakeven in Q3. And I did point out the fact that our base Uber Eats restaurant delivery business was actually profitable in Q3, and we reinvested that profitability into our New Verticals, which will continue. So I think you should expect that in Q4, that would be the case. And so that's what I would tell you, and again, our - you know, we try to put out the bottom line guidance to help as you know we had a terrific October and you heard the numbers around Halloween and what's going on there. But as you also know that the pandemic has been, you know, hard to predict at times. And so you should assume that we're going to be a little bit prudent, you know, as we're thinking about that. So hopefully that answers your question. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, and as far as the difference, let's say, between Europe and the LatAm markets and the US, if we think about Europe first, obviously, the reopening pace very much depends on vaccinations, whether markets are open or whether markets are not open, I'd say generally, Europe has opened up faster than the US. Another factor in Europe, that's a bit different than the US is that, the driver supply is more inelastic, and that a higher percentage of drivers in Europe tend to drive more than 30 hours, say, or more than 40 hours. So during the pandemic, you know, supply didn't go down as much. So that when demand came back, you already had, let's say, excess supply in the market to take up the slack. What we're seeing now in a lot of European markets is that demand is like higher than pre-pandemic. And so we think that the ability for us to grow supply beyond pre-pandemic in Europe is going to take a little bit more time, because the markets tend to be a bit more regulated. And the shift doesn't - just doesn't happen quite as quickly. And you know, part of Q4 is leaning a little bit into those markets based on the results that we've seen in the US, and frankly, kind of the learnings in the US which have been really, really significant and really great work by the teams. Other factor that I'll point to in Europe, that's different from the US is, as far as the use cases go not that different, but airports haven't come back quite as fast in Europe as the US airport trips. We don't see any reason why that won't normalize, but it's just a factor in there. I think if you look at the LatAm markets, you know, super strong markets, generally with the LatAm markets, you know, the - we haven't seen, let's say that kind of closed downs that you see in some of the Western markets. So those markets have been, you know, the lows haven't been as low, the highs haven't been as high et cetera. They've been a bit more fluid. Generally I'd say, Mexico, the reopening is a bit slower than we see in the rest of the world. And we're hoping that the reopening kind of happens in a safe and healthy way. Airport trips in LatAm have been you know, coming back at decent rates. And we are seeing now demand in the LatAm markets be very, very strong. And again, we will look to grow kind of supply, driver activations, et cetera in a constructive way. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Operator, we can take the final question. Operator : Your final question comes from John Blackledge from Cowen. Your line is open. John Blackledge : Great, thanks. Two questions. First, just given the improvements in driver supply in the quarter, when do you think Uber will be at kind of appropriate driver supply to meet the rising Mobility demand? And what the driver utilization gains that you kind of discussed earlier, Dara? As things returned to normal, would you expect to hold on to those driver, those high driver utilization levels? And then just a quick one on the new delivery verticals as a percentage of Delivery GBs in 3Q? And how should that mix trend over time? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, sure. I think listen on the driver supply side, I don't think we're ever going to have enough drivers. I think we're going to want to keep growing our driver supply base, you know, remember in Q4, my saying that you know, are growing our driver supply base and building our relationship with drivers who use the platform and making this a truly, truly great platform to earn on, flexibly earn on is, it's a strategic imperative for the company. And as we grow the use cases, you know, the Mobility use cases, with the new product that I talked about with the Pool product and the high capacity vehicle products and the enterprise high capacity vehicle products in two wheelers and three wheelers, we just think we're going to attract a broader segment of earners, onto the platform along with Delivery. And we are now learning more and through experimentation and data, understanding what the situations are where we can encourage drivers to deliver food and what are the occasions where we can have couriers move people around as well. So I think we're going to see more earners on our platform for years and years to come. And we are finally getting the right muscle in terms of promoting cross platform usage, which is going to lead to higher yield realization on our platform in terms of time of day, and in terms of, you know, driver utilization, structurally, you know, there'll be an advantage over the other players. So we want to be that platform that is kind of the one-stop shop for earners that they keep coming back to for a long period of time. As far as New Verticals as a percentage of Delivery bookings, it's in the 6% to 7% range at this point. And obviously, we want to break into double-digits next year and the years beyond. We are very, very early in the growth curve. We are in investment mode. But I'd say, we're imprudent investment mode. And again, we have the advantage of having audience and it's about cross promoting to our audience, we got a right from Rides to Eats. We're getting it right from Eats the Rides. And we're going to get it right in terms of Eats to New Verticals. John Blackledge : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think that is it. Thank you, everyone for joining us on the call. Huge thank you to Team Uber in getting to EBITDA profitability and I'm addressing the team. You've heard it from me many, many times. This is just one step in the growth and development of our company, but a big thank you to the team. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Lastly, we ask you to review our earnings press release for a detailed Q4 financial review and our Q4 supplemental slides deck for additional disclosures that provide context on recent business performance. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Balaji. We had a strong quarter to close out 2021 on a high note. Our results continued to demonstrate both how eager people are to move around their cities as restrictions ease up, and how Delivery has become an important day -- important part of their daily lives. Gross bookings of $25.9 billion came in at the high end of our guidance range, with MAPCs of 118 million, reaching an all-time high. Continued strong execution by our team delivered $86 million of adjusted EBITDA, nicely above our guidance range. In Q4, we continued to see strong recovery in our Mobility business. December gross bookings nearly recovered to 2019 levels and approached a $50 billion annual run rate in the first few weeks of the month. Meanwhile, Delivery volumes stayed strong as we continue to improve the profitability profile of that business. Delivery reported its first adjusted EBITDA profit, including for the first time in the U.S., even as Uber Eats became the fastest-growing delivery player in America. Uber Freight closed the transformative acquisition with Transplace during the quarter, it's never been clear that our supply chains are in dire need of technical innovation. And along with Transplace, Uber Freight, now at $1 billion quarterly run rate, is well positioned to bring digital native change to the enormous logistics ecosystem. Looking back at 2021, we had a great year. I can't say when exactly as I predicted, but our teams have shown an incredible ability to remain agile and manage through change effectively. Despite COVID and all of its unpredictability, we now have reported our second adjusted EBITDA profitable quarter, and we expect to generate significant and improvement profitability in 2022. Of course, COVID remains a part of our lives. We started to see some impact of the Omicron wave late in December. The silver lining is that the impacts are becoming more muted as we learn to live with the virus. Lockdowns are less strict and vaccines are available across the world. Omicron also arrived at a time of year when we usually see seasonal declines. Toll on Mobility gross bookings decreased 21% from December to January, that's only about 10 points worse than what we typically see at this time of year. On a trips basis, the decline was even more muted, down just 15% month-on-month, with pricing coming down meaningfully as marketplace balance improved. It appears that the Omicron impact on our Mobility business has come and gone relatively quickly, even faster than the global case counts. We're beginning to see several major economies in Europe relaxing COVID restrictions, including the U.K., the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway, with more countries expected to take similar actions soon. In the last two weeks, the Mobility recovery has rapidly resumed with both trips and gross bookings recovering and Mobility gross bookings last week up 25% month-on-month. I'll quickly touch on driver supply, which continues to improve. We made steady progress through product innovation, more targeted marketing and on-the-ground operational refinements to onboard more drivers and couriers faster. Nearly 325,000 people started to work on Uber in the quarter, bringing our total global active earner base to 4.4 million people, the largest it's been since the second quarter of 2020. One important call-out is that while the Omicron wave acted as a temporary deterrent to demand, supply has been much more stable. As a result, surge and wait times have improved to their lowest level in the year. Recent internal research has shown that Uber is by far the preferred choice amongst drivers, and we're confident that our marketplace will be more, not less balanced going forward. Turning now to Delivery, which exceeded our expectations and performed better than we typically in January, likely in part to Omicron. This relative overperformance has moderated just as the Mobility trends have improved. Overall trends continue to be very healthy, and there's no question now that Delivery's here stay, both in food and other verticals. Delivery reached an important milestone in Q4, generating $25 million in segment adjusted EBITDA and marking the first profitable quarter of many to come. And as I said on our last call with you, we view the turn to EBITDA profitability as a big moment, but ultimately just a step along the way. It's creating a self-sustaining and incredibly valuable business. With this milestone accomplished, delivery is well positioned to self-fund growth in grocery, retail and local commerce, and let me underscore, we expect significant EBITDA profit generation even after those investments. Finally, it's worth spending a few minutes on a couple of our growth initiatives across the Company. Our advertising business ended the year with around $225 million in run rate revenue, well above the $100 million target we laid out earlier this year. While much of the attention has sponsor listing for Uber Eats, we have a road map to build a much broader business, including in Mobility. We also closed the acquisition of Drizly during the quarter, which will be a nice addition to our advertising efforts. Our new verticals businesses, which includes grocery, alcohol, convenience and other non-restaurant efforts, grew nearly 10% quarter-on-quarter in Q4 on an organic basis, reaching a best month ever in December. We continue to make progress in improving non-restaurant merchant selection in the U.S. And as a result, the U.S. grew at 3x the rate of our global new verticals business during the quarter. Internationally, we continue to have a strong lead in grocery and other verticals. We're working to build on that lead with new quick commerce offerings, and we're intentionally taking a partner-led approach here with encouraging signs of adoption. For example, in France, Carrefour Sprint stores have represented nearly 20% of new verticals, orders in Paris and with significantly higher per store productivity than other new verticals merchants in market. Uber for Business also reached a milestone during the quarter with managed U4B gross bookings, surpassing its previous high from 2019 with well over $1 billion in annual run rate GBs. Over the next few years, U4B's enterprise offerings, which importantly spans both mobility and delivery, will significantly outpace our consumer business and become a meaningful contributor to growth and profitability. Before I hand it over to Nelson, plug for everyone to tune into our Investor Day tomorrow morning, which you can live stream on our website. Over the past few quarters, we've talked a lot about the power of the platform and the potential for Uber's complementary services to contribute to lower cost of acquisition and higher lifetime value. We're looking forward to discussing our strategy, our plans for each of our business and the growing advantage of our platform in a lot more detail tomorrow. Uber is emerging from the pandemic stronger than ever. As long as we execute on the opportunities in well positioned to deliver strong, profitable growth with significant expansion in profitability and cash flow generation over the coming quarters and years. Now, over to Nelson. Nelson Chai : Thanks, Dara. Q4 was a strong quarter in all dimensions with solid gross bookings, adjusted EBITDA and margin performance for all of our businesses. Mobility gross bookings grew 67% and the segment generated a healthy adjusted EBITDA margin of 5.1% of gross bookings, up 80 basis points year-over-year even as take rate declined 160 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to our driver supply investments. Excluding those investments, Mobility incremental margins would have approached 10% on a year-over-year basis, with marketplace balance in a much better spot than at any point in 2021, we are confident that Mobility's incremental margins will improve meaningfully in 2022. Delivery gross bookings grew 33% and reached its first adjusted EBITDA profitable quarter with a $25 million EBITDA profit in Q4 as core food delivery profitability expanded to more than cover our investments into grocery and other new initiatives. Importantly, we recorded our first adjusted EBITDA profit for delivery in the U.S. and Canada. Expanding margins 180 basis points of gross bookings year-over-year, while gaining category share in the U.S. Freight closed the previously announced transaction of Transplace during Q4, significantly expanding freight scale and the scope of our offering by combining Freight's digital freight brokerage technology with Transplace's managed transportation platform. Both freight and transplants are ending 2022 with strong momentum with healthy onboarding of new logos, and we are excited to demonstrate the potential of the combined asset. Looking ahead to full year 2022, we continue to expect to deliver incremental EBITDA margins as a percentage of gross bookings of around 10% for Mobility and over 5% for Delivery. In addition, we expect freight to generate positive adjusted EBITDA in 2022. While we continue to invest in platform R&D to ensure our products continue to be the best out there, we expect to deliver healthy leverage on that line as well. Taken together, those commitments translate to a meaningful profitability expansion for Uber 2022. Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity position. We continue to maintain a strong liquidity position, ending the quarter with $4.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and our equity stakes were marked at $12.5 billion. We benefited from the change in value of Grab and Aurora as these companies reached liquidity milestones as well as gains from selling some of our interest in Yandex. These benefits were partially offset by the significant movement in DD stock from September 30 to December 31 as we marked down the value of our DD stake by $1.3 billion. The net effect of these moves was a $1.4 billion tailwind to our GAAP net income. As I have previously noted, our GAAP net income may continue to see swings from quarter-to-quarter from the large equity stakes on our balance sheet. While we intend to monetize some of our financial stakes at an appropriate time, we have sufficient liquidity to give us the flexibility to maintain these positions with the aim of maximizing value for Uber and our shareholders. I'll conclude my remarks with an update on recent business trends and Q1 outlook. It's important to note that typical seasonality during Q1 is for mobility and delivery trips and gross bookings to be flat quarter-over-quarter. Given Omicron-related demand impact, we expect Mobility gross bookings to decline quarter-over-quarter, while delivery is likely to be flat to up modestly. In aggregate, we estimate these demand impacts to be $1 billion to $1.2 billion of drag in Q1 gross bookings. Additionally, Q1 will represent the first full quarter of Transplace contributions, which is expected to add an incremental $600 million in quarter one to Freight gross bookings relative to Q4. Despite the meaningful gross bookings impact, we are confident that the breadth of our business will allow us to expand profitability. With that context for Q1, we expect total company gross bookings to be between $25 billion and $26 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 28% to 33%, and we expect a total company adjusted EBITDA profit between $100 million and $130 million for the quarter. With that, let's open it up to questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : I just wanted to ask you about drivers and couriers. I think you talked about 4.4 million, and I believe that's relative to 5 million pre-COVID. Just curious kind of what the factors are maybe if you were at a similar level in terms of overall bookings? Just what kind of efficiencies you might see relative to pre-COVID? And whether you would need a similar kind of number of drivers and couriers at that point? And then also, if you could just talk a little bit about Uber One, and what you're seeing early on here given a very compelling value proposition versus previous subscription offerings? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely, Doug. So as it relates to drivers and couriers, first factor that we're seeing that's really encouraging is that the onboarding rate and onboarding conversion rates are happening much more successfully. This is because we essentially onboard earners and then we give them work opportunities rather than onboarding them either as a driver or as a courier. And as a result, earners can start earning much faster on our platform. So we're seeing a lot of positive input into the platform. It's also great because earners is going to earn during a period when everyone is trying to get back on their feet without as much government help as we have previously. So it works out for everyone, and it definitely helps out for our marketplace. While we haven't done the specific analysis of like how many earners do we need on a GB basis, it's my strong instinct that our marketplace has gotten more efficient. This is because we are now across dispatching between driving people and driving things that creates higher utilization for earners and makes for a more efficient marketplace. We're also seeing, on the Delivery side, as the marketplace grows and essentially densifies -- we got more restaurants on the marketplace. We have more consumers ordering. And as a result, the average length of the delivery is coming down so that you essentially delivering is becoming more efficient from a network perspective. So network efficiency is up. The efficiency essentially relies -- the efficiency results in earners being busy, a higher percentage of the time when they're looking for opportunities. And as you can see, kind of the marketplace metrics are coming down in terms of surge, in terms of ETAs and delivery times are first rate. So the efficiency trends that we're seeing are quite encouraging. As far as Uber One goes, it's very early. And last quarter, we talked about members around the world. And the early signal that we're seeing for Uber One is very encouraging. It's a consumer value proposition that's quite compelling because pricing is equal to the pricing of our competition but our content is better, right? It's just a content in terms of free delivery and discounts on rise and the discounts on rides in a world that is increasingly opening, thank God, is going to become more and more valuable. So we believe we have a content advantage over competition that is going to show up over time and is going to compound upon itself. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : I know we're going to talk more longer term tomorrow, but just maybe taking a step back on some of the shorter-term dynamics. In terms of the Mobility business, we talked with one of your competitors last night about the dynamic of product mix and geo mix in the U.S. Can you give us a little bit of color on what you're seeing globally from geo mix and open versus closed environment or product mix like airport rides versus business roads or elements of that in terms of how that might be driving elements of December into January? And how should we think about that as the quarter evolves. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. I think generally, the trends that Lyft talked about during their call are fairly consistent with our trips. So for example, we saw airport GBs up about 200% year-on-year, about 175% in the U.S. In December, rides tend to get longer holiday rides, et cetera. So we saw similar trends in terms of length of trip, et cetera, which certainly is encouraging. I'd say nothing significant there, one way or the other. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Wonder if you could talk a little bit more about the driver incentives in the quarter? And how you see kind of the take rates evolving? Is there some big upside there as you look forward to the next couple of years? And how that flows through the margins? Nelson Chai : So first of all, I think if you remember, Justin, when we did the Q3 call, we actually highlighted that it was going to be the fact. And a lot of it just had to do with marketplaces opening and closing because of the pandemic. And so we knew when we talked to you that places like Australia were going to open, and then we are going to lean in. I think you heard in my prepared remarks, if you actually backed out for some of that, we would have seen the incremental margins that we've talked about, and there is a little bit of seasonality. But again, what I would say is that our goal is to make sure that -- we continue to overachieve both on the top line, but as well as on the bottom line and the profitability, expanding the margins. And so we did that, and we knew we did that. And so because of that, we will take opportunities at some point to continue to build supply. We are entering this year, as you heard in our comments, and probably our best supply situation we've had since the pandemic started and certainly in 2020. One -- and so again, we think that will be beneficial as we go into 2022. You'll hear us talk a little bit more about it. But yes, I think that you should -- we believe that we will see good margin expansion as we think about 2022. Dara Khosrowshahi : And Justin, I'd also remind you that we manage to EBITDA dollars and margins and free cash flow dollars and margins as a percentage of GB and revenue margin is an input as part of it. There are algos that are constantly balancing between pricing in order to maximize getting the next ride and/or pricing driver side pricing that is optimal as well. So the revenue margin that you see, it's more of an output. Like at the end of the month or at the end of the quarter, we like look at our revenue margins, but we're managing to the business. We're trying to maximize gross bookings. We're trying to maximize trips. And frankly, we're going to -- we're trying to maximize throughput. So our marketplace delivers maximum earnings to the earners on our marketplace because it means it becomes a much more attractive marketplace for earners to participate in. One area of upside, I would tell you that you have seen in our delivery margins, which is like delivery growth was great. We were able to gain share and margins increased. It's because we're optimizing on cost per trip around as the network is densifying. Cost per trip is coming down pretty substantially, especially, in the U.S., and we think there's more to come. And that's just pure goodness because carriers are busy. Again your food quickly, it's a revenue margin upside, and we can reinvest that revenue margin essentially and gaining share. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Two, just a -- the first one I wanted to ask about the category share gains in the U.S. food delivery. Any specific sort of adjustments you've made or strategic developments that you've done that have really sort of driven that? And how do you think about still existing learning fruit areas to further improve the food delivery market share? And then, Dara, just curious to hear kind of qualitatively, how you think about some of the key drivers of the multiyear consumer rideshare side of the business and you're thinking through one and other pricing mechanisms, et cetera? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Absolutely. As far as the first question in the U.S. goes, I'd say it's just -- it's core execution. None of this is wizardry. Our selection in the U.S. is improving. Our selection in suburbs is getting much better, still not where it needs to be, but it's getting much better. I talked about cost per trip coming down, which allows us to reinvest in the top line, whether it's in marketing or its incentives. Membership as a percentage of our gross bookings is increasing, so we're getting more frequency coming through the system. And something that we'll talk more about tomorrow is that the cross-platform activity across both mobility and delivery continues to increase. That is chiefly, at this point, benefiting the delivery business. It's an attribute that is completely unique to Uber and it is becoming more of a factor. So there's like these three kind of eaters that are coming through the system that aren't available to our competitors. New eaters as a percentage of our total gross bookings every quarter is actually pretty small because we have a really big base of eaters who are loyal to us who keep coming back. But when you have new eaters quarter after quarter after quarter, it starts compounding. And we believe that we're starting to see the effects of that compounding happened last quarter and certainly this quarter, and we hope that it will continue. If it doesn't, we're not doing our jobs. Nelson Chai : And the only point I'd add is we did make a change in terms of our leadership in the U.S. at the beginning of the year. And he and his team deserve kudos because it really was a focus, and he and the team have come in and done a terrific job. And so again, we have a lot of confidence going into next year. And you're right, it wasn't for me just the fact that we continue to gain competitive positioning versus our competitors, but we did it in a way where we are now going to be profitable doing it. And so again, a lot of it goes to him and the team because we have a big team of folks here and they really operated well. Your second point is on mobility. I believe. And so, the only thing I'd say there is I think tomorrow, you'll get a very, very good overview of our long-term strategy and then how it impacts our medium to long-term views, both in terms of compounding revenue as well as profitability. Just as the marketplaces come back, here's one easy step for you. We added 20 million new riders just in Q4 in our mobility business. So if you think about the network effect and our ability to operate across our 10,000 cities in our leadership position, you can think about that leverage that we have globally that nobody else has. And so, as the world is coming back, I think that we'll spend a lot of time tomorrow. Mac will spend a lot of tomorrow talking about how we're going to continue to grow at scale and a lot of the untapped areas that we're driving. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open. Ross Sandler : I wanted to talk about the ads uplift. So you're running well ahead of plan with the 225 annualized. Just your overall outlook on advertising, how big that could be and maybe how is coming into the fall might have a jump start? Balaji Krishnamurthy : Ross, you're coming through very muffled. But if you don't mind repeating the question, we'll try and get your response. Ross Sandler : Just from the ads business and how Drizly might be helping with that plan. Dara Khosrowshahi : Ross, so the ad business we talked about hitting a $225 million run rate in Q4, well above our targets. The momentum in the business is great. Keep in mind that that is the vast majority of that is delivery, and we are building out ad products that run across mobility and delivery and grocery Drizly is going to be a part of our ad operations. For example, Drizly advertising as a percentage of gross bookings is about 8% which is pretty significant. That's not in the numbers that we write you out on because Drizly has been part of our numbers partial in Q4. But with the mix of higher grocery, higher alcohol you should expect that to be essentially upside in terms of our advertising revenue and the growth ahead. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Any questions? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : So I guess the first one, following up on Justin's question. So are you -- do you feel that you're largely done having to invest in driver supply? And I guess, as more drivers come back into the marketplace and pricing comes down, do you see any of them kind of turning back off? Like is there more sensitivity from drivers to maintaining that higher prices? Or is it mostly just you stimulate to get them back on and then they stay on. And then the second one is, it sounds like a big effort on improving the driver onboarding flow to get them on the road faster. I guess beyond that beginning period where maybe a driver can only drive for delivery, are you seeing a big uptick in the percent of drivers that drive for both Delivery and Mobility on an ongoing basis? That can kind of help drive that efficiency or sustain that efficiency? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. We want driver retention trends very closely. And obviously, in January, with the Omicron wave, we wanted to make sure the demand came down. We were watching the number of drivers on the platform, the number of suppliers, et cetera. And what we've seen are pretty encouraging signs that drivers have stayed on the platform. In general, I would tell you that demand in the platform, both in terms of mobility and delivery is a fast twitch muscle. It moves much faster. In supply, earner supply on a platform, it's a slow switch muscle. It will respond but it will respond more slowly than demand, so to speak. Now that we're seeing the Omicron bounce back, we're pretty confident that our supply situation is looking good right now, and it's going to look good for the balance of the year, but it's always something that we're watching. And generally, retention rates are quite good. We are actively looking to sign up drivers, a higher percentage of drivers to work across platform. And whereas our algorithms previously were, I'd say, more highly tuned towards Mobility-only or Delivery-only. Our algorithms are now being tuned to the Uber marketplace. And so our cross-dispatching in a much more fluid elegant way, and that's only going to improve. These are, I would say, relatively early iterations, and you should expect to see more cross-platform activity, both on the consumer side but also on the earner side. And again, we'll have a lot more to say about that tomorrow at Investor Day. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Erickson with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Brad Erickson : Nelson, I think you mentioned that you expect now over 5% of marginal delivery bookings to drop to EBITDA. So it sounds like there's maybe a bit of a discretionary component there I guess I was just wondering sort of what the philosophy is to allow that upside or any potential upside to flow through? Or will it be reinvested? And I guess, if so, how. Nelson Chai : So again, I think, as Dara mentioned earlier, so the 5% is incremental margins as we continue to grow the business. We're not optimizing for that number. We're optimizing to grow our gross bookings and to grow our bottom line, our adjusted EBITDA and that is really just an output. Obviously, one we watch and how you guys spend a lot of time watching it. And so again, I'm really just trying to get some direction. We'll address a little bit more of the mid- to medium-term kind of modeling, if you will, tomorrow. But again, we do expect that we will -- the incremental margin will be around 5% for our Delivery business. Dara Khosrowshahi : And we do think that the 5% represents a balanced viewpoint. It allows us to reinvest where we see growth ahead of us. It allows us to be quite competitive. Again, we have the platform advantage versus our competition, which is just a structural advantage that we have. And then, it's also responsible to our shareholders because ultimately, we want to be a growth business, but we want to be a profitable growth business and we want to be improving margins going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Two quick ones. So first, following up on the driver incentives and incremental margins, you noted that you expect incremental margins on the right business to be like 10% for '22. How should we generally think about the sensitivity of driver incentives through the year to that? Is that something that you can achieve even if markets come back in elevated strength globally, and then maybe driver shortages kind of are more widespread geographically? And then sort of a second question on the Eats side. It seems like MAPCs, frequency, basket size were all stable quarter-to-quarter. Can you talk about whether there were any geographical discrepancies maybe in some countries where we've been reopened for a while, compared to other markets? Nelson Chai : So first of all, in terms of your question on the drivers part, that is an annual number. And so there may be some quarter-to-quarter fluctuations because you're right. It's Omicron -- COVID if has actually shown us anything, we expect the unexpected. And so we are highly confident we'll be able to manage that on an annual basis. There may be a quarter here or there. And in terms of your question about our ability to do it, yes, we optimize our marketplace every single day across our 10,000 markets. And as you can tell from our -- what we achieved in Q4, we've gotten pretty good at it, particularly as the Mobility business has come back post-pandemic. And so, we feel pretty good about where we sit today. And so again, we're highly confident. If you look at the past a couple of quarters in terms of our ability to generate the 10% incremental margin on the mobility side. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then I'd say on the MAPC side, we're pretty much saw strength across the board. I mean if there are any call-outs U.S. mobility MAPc on a year-on-year basis because the U.S. had closed down on a comparable basis more than other geos was super strong. And even on a quarter-on-quarter basis, audience in Q4 for our mobility business grew versus Q3. But it's been actually remarkably consistent. And the growth that you see in both mobility and delivery has been global. There are lots of ups and downs. But the really great thing that we're seeing now is that the diversification within our portfolio of mobility and delivery and then the geographic diversification allows us when something is weak, we can lean in to help things out. When one geo is particularly strong, we can take some of that strength and reinvest it in other areas. The diversification of our portfolio is really coming into play. And we kind of saw it in January. I mean, no one wants to go through another COVID wave or the Omicron wave. The business was pretty darn resilient in January, which is why in Q1, you can see our guidance is stronger than Q4. That speaks to the portfolio approach really coming to the fourth. Jason Helfstein : Did we answer all of your questions? Deepak Mathivanan : Yes, I think. I think that was a lot. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from James Lee with The Mizuho Group. Your line is open. James Lee : I just want to get some regulatory update here. I think in the U.K., I think your license is up for renewal this quarter. And maybe how should we think about financial implications on the reclassification to worker clients? And also moving to merchant model? And also in the U.S., any update from the California appeal and the development in key states like New York and Massachusetts. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. I think on the U.K. license, we're in construction -- constructive dialogue with TFL. I'd say our relationship with the City of London is better than it's ever been. About 10% of our kilometers now in London or EV or clean and we're looking to drive that up very actively in partnership with the city. So that relationship has really changed, and we're very hopeful that we get the license renewal, but we never take anything for granted. So we'll see, although we're pretty confident of our position. The worker reclassification that we underwent in the U.K. was the right thing to do. There isn't a level playing field yet. We believe there should be a level playing field. We're paying it for financially now because our earners in the U.K. are workers are getting lots of benefits that are competition essentially doesn't have to pay. But sometimes the right thing to do is expensive. And in this case, in the U.K., it's expensive. But we think with time, there will be a level playing field there's no question about it. The only question is when it happens. And I think like long term, short term, being a good citizen, being a good company on the ground sometimes hurts financially. The long term, you get gains. We want to be in the U.K. We want to be in London for the next 10, 15, 20 years and that means doing the right thing, and I think we are in the U.K. It will resolve itself. I can't tell you when. I think as far as California goes, it's running through the process. We're very confident of our position, but I don't really have anything to share one way or the other. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : I'm just going to ask one. Just when you think about Uber Pass and specifically restaurants and delivery, are there any deficits in capabilities or coverage in major markets versus your largest competitors and kind of how you think about that? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, Jason, it's Uber One now. We still have to rebrand it. As far as coverage goes, our selection in urban markets, I think, is excellent and is on par or better than our competition, although it can always get better. I think it's a selection in suburbs. Our CP and suburbs still trails DoorDash. We are seeing our selection improve. We have reorganized our sales team to be much more local, to be on the ground to understand what that neighborhood restaurant is. And I'd say -- there may be a few exceptions, but the vast majority of restaurant partners want to work with more than one partner. And we are the second player but by far, the biggest second player in the U.S. And we have a great sales team now -- and our systems are much, much better in partnering up with those restaurants. So in the suburbs today, we do have certain gaps, and we're going to work really, really hard to make up for those gaps certainly by the end of 2022. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Edward Yruma : It seems like a lot of private capital is pushing into ultrafast delivery. I know you're even partnering with Gopuff private in the space. I guess kind of how do you view the space right now? And what do you partnership versus what do you do on your own? Nelson Chai : Well, so as you know, we are right now primarily doing partnerships. And so we have a wonderful partnership with Carrefour in France as well. And we have a partnership with Gopuff here in the U.S. We are doing a little bit of testing on our own mainly because we do -- there's a couple of places in Taiwan and Japan where we're doing some testing. We want to understand the whole value prop and the different parts of the value chain. I guess our view is that we definitely want to care about making sure that we have a good product delivered to our consumers. There is a lot of private capital at it. I do think over time that there will be some normalization between the private and the public markets, if you will. And so what I would say is you'll hear tomorrow, we are going after this new vertical space. We're doing it with primarily a partnership approach. And I think we are leveraging both our capabilities and trying to maintain more of an asset-light model, which I think will be beneficial Dara Khosrowshahi : I think the only thing to add to Nelson's commentary is that we have an enormous global footprint, which is unique amongst a lot of other players out there. We're in 32 delivery markets. And every single market has different regulatory issues. Every single city is different. And so the partner approach allows us to essentially penetrate into the many, many geographies and the many, many cities in which we operate faster in a capital-light way. Our goal is with commerce -- to get quick commerce to as many eaters in the world as possible, as quickly as possible. We think we can move faster because we have partners who are on the ground. They understand cities, the cities in which they operate in. They have a long history. And ultimately, we think the partner-led approach is a better approach. We'll see if that turns out to be true or not, but we're pretty confident in the early signal that we're seeing. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Operator, we'll take one last question. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Your line is open. John Blackledge : Two questions. First, what were other delivery verticals outside of Eats as a percent of delivery gross bookings in the fourth quarter? And then second, with the Car Next Door acquisition, could you discuss kind of the rationale? And do you expect to enter additional markets with that type of offering? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. I'll start the second one first. As far as Car Next Door goes, we -- you'll hear more about this in Investor Day tomorrow. But we're essentially -- we want Uber Rides to be a complete mobility solution. And that means essentially being there for you on any occasion where you need a car to ultimately replace first, your second car, but ultimately, car ownership. And Car Next Door allows us to have relevancy for those situations where you need a car for over a weekend, et cetera. We have partnerships with Avis, Hertz, et cetera, part of the magic of Uber is P2P, is managing a supply and demand kind of two-sided marketplace. Car Next Door is a two-sided rental marketplace, great business in Australia. Australia is a spectacular market for us in both mobility and delivery. So it's coming strength. And yes, our ambition is absolutely to go global. And we have audience here, like this is the playbook that we run with new verticals, we're going global with Eats, we went global. And I think with peer-to-peer car rentals, yes, we'll go global. We'll make sure we do it in the right way. Nelson, do you want to talk about new verticals as a percentage of GBs? Nelson Chai : Yes. So right in the fourth quarter, new verticals approached about a $4 billion run rate. And so if you think about it, in Q4, we were a $54 billion run rate for the total Delivery marketplace. So it's pretty simple math. Dara Khosrowshahi : And I think one of the cool other metrics other than GBs that we measure, is what percentage of our monthly active platform customers are ordering from new verticals. So in Q4, about 12% of our monthly actives had a new vertical order in kind of our focus markets because we're not yet deep in every single market out there. That's another metric that we closely track. As that MAPC number goes up, gross bookings will go up as well. All right. That's it everyone. Thank you very much for joining us on the call and just shout out to the Uber team. It's been a long year. I think the team really turned around in the second half. We delivered a great Q4, and I'm more confident than ever in our prospects for 2022 because of the work that the team has done. So thanks, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Uber First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Balaji Krishnamurthy, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Thanks, Emma. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber's first quarter 2022 earnings presentation.

We published a quarterly earning press release, prepared remarks and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website about an hour ago. And we ask you to review those documents, if you haven't already. We will open the call to questions, following brief opening remarks from Dara. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Balaji. We delivered a very strong quarter across the Board with record results on the top and bottom line. After two years of persistent and sometimes unpredictable impacts across our business, our Q1 results resoundingly affirm that we are on a strong path emerging out of the pandemic. Our focus on profitable growth, product innovation and operational excellence over the last two years has set us apart from the pack. Our Mobility team is demonstrating phenomenal execution, growing both demand and supply faster than competitors and rapidly innovating to rollout new accretive offerings all while delivering record margins despite the macro turbulence that we all see. Delivery is continuing to surprise us positively as demand has remained resilient in a reopening world and we expect topline growth and profitability to expand through 2022. Finally, Freight reached its first profitable quarter as well. We are keenly aware that the market is placing a high value on companies generating and expanding profits as interest rates rise. We are leading the industry in this respect. Our focus over the past two years on profitable growth has resulted in the strong top and bottom lines that we delivered in Q1. We are confident that our leadership position, our global scale and our innovation and platform advantages will allow us to deliver significant profitability and durable growth as investors rightly expect from globally scaled technology platforms. We are committed to taking all necessary actions to continue to deliver industry-leading margins and free cash flow generation, along with a disciplined capital allocation strategy. We\u2019ve never been more optimistic about our prospects, and we are determined to execute as a team to bring that optimism to fruition. With that, let's go to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two. The first one, sort of on users and on drivers. I was wondering, Dara, in the past, you've shared stats about some of your cross-platform adoption, 17% of users in the past, et cetera. Any updates on what you're seeing on cross-platform adoption for your users and drivers, and just some of the benefits of your multi-product offering integration you are seeing from that is the first one. And the second one, just a comment about the expected acceleration in delivery in the back half. Anything you call out there on what you're seeing on user growth cohort, or anything sort of gives you confidence in the ability to continue to accelerate the delivery business through a potentially weaker consumer? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, definitely. As far as our cross-platform usage, it remains strong and consistent really with what we went through with you at Investor Day. And what are the interesting factors that we're seeing is that as mobility is opening up, mobility of significant number of new riders are coming on to the platform. And that gives us the opportunity to then upsell those new mobility riders to Eats, to our grocery offerings, and then ultimately to our Uber One membership plan, which is the only membership plan globally that offers both mobility and delivery offerings as well. So what we're seeing is really kind of a swelling of new audience coming in that then we can essentially upsell our cross-platform products and then ultimately membership as well. So we're super optimistic about all of the platform investments that we're making and the potential there. We've already launched, obviously, Uber One in the U.S. We announced launches in Mexico and Germany. We got a number of other launches teed up for the balance of the year. And I will remind everyone that members spend 2.7x more than non-members. So as we move over, as new customers come in, we cross-sell them into the platform, we cross-sell them into membership, we can increase the spend and the lock-in that our platform provides in a way that no other monoline player can. And we already have the formula down and it's about rolling out Uber One globally, and then applying the same formula over and over again. Then on the cross-platform side, the side that's invisible to I'd say most investors is on the earner side. And we talked about how our efforts to sign-up earners now are truly cost-platform. We bring you in not to drive or to deliver, but we bring you in to earn on the Uber platform. The success there has been very, very significant. You heard I think last night, one of our competitors in the U.S. having challenges or at least looking to lean into driver supply. Our active drivers in the U.S. and Canada are up 70% on a year-on-year basis in April. New drivers were up 121% year-over-year in April. And it's because we're bringing new drivers on not as Uber Rides, not as Uber Eats, but as Uber as a platform and to earn in anyway, shape or form that they can on the platform. And that's proving to be a structural advantage from what we can see versus the competition both locally, and then we think ultimately globally. Brian Nowak : And then question on back half for delivery? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. Of course, back half for the delivery goes, it really is about the European reopenings and comps. So some of the countries, France, for example, is reopening. It is spectacular news for mobility business. It makes the delivery comps a little bit tougher. So I think you'll see Q2 growth rates similar to Q1. And then we expect Q3 and Q4 to accelerate. And I think you've also seen for us as a team we've delivered on what we say we're going to do. So we're pretty confident of acceleration in the second half. The other factor that's going to affect the second half is that with new verticals, actually very recently, along with the Albertsons deal, we are now launching the native stack of Cornershop, essentially grocery on the Uber Eats platform. It's very, very early, but we see substantial improvements in customer experience, and we see substantial improvements in terms of conversion on the Uber Eats native stack. So we think that the U.S. growth rate that is already pretty high is going to significantly accelerate in the second half of the year, which again gives us confidence as the delivery growth rates in the second half of the year. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Douglas Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask two on the mobility product side, Dara. Just if you could talk a little bit about the efforts so far with upfront fare and destination info and some of the key benefits and the rollout timing there. And then also about around UberX Share, how that's reimagined and the key points of differentiation? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. As far as upfront destination, one of the most significant complaints that we get from our earners and our drivers is that they don't know where the upfront destination is. And if you go back to the origins of this business and how pricing was built, pricing originally was based on time and distance. And that comes from, let's say, the taxi days. But the fact is that based on the destination, the value of a ride, which may take the same amount of time and distance for a driver maybe very different based on the destination. So if you're going from the airport into Central San Francisco and you're going to get a ride as soon as you drop the person off, that's a pretty valuable ride. If you carry a passenger, same time and distance, into the outskirts of the neighborhood and then have to drive back empty for, let's say, 30 or 40 minutes, that's not a ride that's particularly valuable to an earner. And if you're purely wasting your charges on time and distance, essentially those two rides are priced equally. We think that's a bug in our system, and it certainly does not serve the best interest of the earners. So now with our new system, we display the full information of the ride, especially what the destination is. Our algorithms are then able to take signal, let's say, the trip out to the outskirts where the drivers have to come back empty, we will then price up that trip so that the earner trip earns the fair value of that fair, and also knows exactly what they're accepting or not accepting. That also improves the consumer experience because cancellation rates, once drivers understand what the destination is go down as well. There's a huge amount of technology that has to go into developing this kind of a system because essentially the pricing systems have to get signal based on earner behavior in order to hone in the pricing to truly price kind of that trip based on the market clearing price that earners are willing to accept that trip with, so there's a huge amount of ML data work that goes into that system, but we think it's fundamentally a better way, and the feedback that we're getting from our driver partners has been quite positive. It's a big change that I'll tell you, and there's a lot of debugging going on, there's a lot of algorithmic works to make sure that the earner experience is as great as it is, but we're very, very optimistic about this fundamental change. Last thing I'll say about this is, this is one of those invisible or not so invisible benefits of the platform. This is actually how delivery has been pricing their trips for some period of time. Delivery companies show upfront where you pick something up, they show an upfront fare. It's exactly like introducing upfront fare to Uber riders and our being a multi-platform, multi-product business allows us to take learnings from one side of a business, apply it to the other, and instead of kind of starting from scratch, we've already \u2013 we're adolescence now using all open knowledge from our delivery business and passing it on to the mobility business. So lots of advantages having a single marketplace team, a single technology team, thinking about the best of both worlds and constantly applying learnings for one to the other. And then as far as UberX Share, we're super excited about the business. I think with Share, we're looking to resolve a fundamental issue that the older pool model had, which is the interest of the rider and the interest of Uber were misaligned, right, which is the rider would ask for a pool trip, hoping not to be batched and Uber obviously would want that trip to be matched in order to achieve the economics that we expect. With UberX Share, there's an upfront discount. And when you are matched with another rider, you get a higher discount on your trip. So all of a sudden interests are aligned in this kind of system and we're very, very encouraged by the early signal that we're seeing and we're looking to launch UberX Share at about 15 markets in the next quarter, and we will continue to expand from there. So both upfront fare and UberX Share are areas that we're quite excited about and areas where there's a lot of innovation going in for the teams. Douglas Anmuth : Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question? Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two, if I can. On the delivery business, you grew, as you talked about earners at a very high rate, especially the U.S. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive landscape for earners in the delivery business and where you see yourself vis-\u00e0-vis competition from a scale standpoint, especially in the markets that you think are the most important to you, where it lines up the most with the mobility business? And then on the expansion of categories, how important is it to get some of those categories right as standalone apps and standalone businesses versus them being broadly more folded into the Uber app and getting the platform experience more right than wrong if you look out over the next couple of years vertical versus platform? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. I think in the U.S. on the earner side, and again, we don't necessarily look at earners now as couriers or drivers because increasingly we want earners to earn, however they want to on a particular day. They may want to stay in their little neighborhood and that accrues more to delivering food because typically you stay within a certain radius or they may want to make more money and right now earnings for drivers, for example, who drive more than 20 hours on our platform in the last quarter were $39, including tips. So earnings are super, super high, which is great for earners. On the courier side, I wouldn't say that there's a huge amount of competition in that, we've got plenty of couriers and from what we can tell our competitors do as well, it's a very flexible way to earn, which our earners appreciate. So we have seen the number of active couriers globally up 34% on a year-on-year basis and in the U.S. and Canada up 79% year-on-year. So we're in very good shape there and actually a fair amount of the year-on-year increase in take rates, call it, true take rates that you're seeing in the delivery business is because we've been able to drive cost per transaction down as a result of higher efficiency in our marketplace because we have plenty of couriers. And as we get more density in our marketplace, essentially the distances that we have to carry food and go pick up food, et cetera, come reduce and our algorithms in terms of routing and batching continue to optimize and get better and better and better. That is essentially upside as it relates to net revenue. And it really doesn't cost anything. It just costs engineering time to achieve which is time that we have. And then as far as the super app versus multi app consumer experience, the way that we're doing it is on the consumer side, we're looking to get the best of both worlds. Think about it in the same way that Facebook has a family of apps. They've got Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp, and they're kind of loosely coupled. Same thing with Google, they got Google and Google Maps and Google Mail. Again, they're coupled, you have one identity, one payments, et cetera. We're looking to achieve the same thing, multiple apps, whether it's Uber, Uber Eats or Cornershop, your identity is the same drizzly, your sign ups are same, we treat you the same way your customer experiences is consistently excellent. You've got the Uber One membership that flows across all those apps to save you on delivery fees. And at the same time within each app, we're constantly cross promoting one platform to the other. On rides, we're cross promoting each. We're actually super excited. We're starting to cross promote rides on our Eats app. And frankly, weren't sure if it's going to work. We now see signal that it's working. Actually, we're able to resurrect riders back into the reopening through the Uber Eats app, which is something that we're super excited about. So all the apps talk to each other, cross promote each other. We use machine learning algorithms to figure out what is the best promotion to put in front of the right person at the right occasion. And you can imagine, lunchtime, the promo, maybe different than drinks time, for example. On the backend, as it relates to earners, we are a single super app. And essentially you sign-up to earn on Uber and more and more, we will offer you different opportunities to earn based on what we know about your profile, based on time of day, based on where you are and based on what the opportunities are. And we think that's a very, very significant structural advantage over other players in our industry, none of which has a super app model. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for all the color. Dara Khosrowshahi : You bet. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. I guess, just given the challenges at Lyft, they talked about on driver incentives. Can you talk about the mobility supply-demand dynamics and how you're going to manage what hopes to be a pretty robust opening over the next six months? And then when you look at your prepared remarks, some interesting stuff on regulatory and new use cases. Just want to see if you feel like you're kind of getting over the hump here on regulatory, if there's real progress there, and why you've kind of decided now to expand some use cases to car rentals and travel. Does that kind of signal that the core business is now kind of on a positive trajectory? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. Listen, Justin, our need to increase the number of drivers on the platform is nothing new nor is it a surprise. We were on this last year. If you remember, Q2 of last year, we were very early. We saw signal and we leaned in very aggressively initially with incentives into improving our driver supply. And then we followed up the investment incentives with tons and tons of innovation in terms of product, in terms of improving the driver sign-up flow, in terms of welcoming drivers to the Uber family and then giving them opportunities, delivery opportunities or rides opportunities. We see the sooner an earner can earn on the platform, the higher our sign-up rate to that first trip. And often we can get earners earning on the platform faster with delivery than we can with mobility because of regulations or background checks, et cetera. So we're able to engage that earner with money in their pockets really, really early. And at the same time, we've invested experiences where instead of, for example, you're having to upload your documents into our systems. We will go connect to insurance companies, DMVs, et cetera. And as we build out those APIs, essentially upload those documents automatically versus having you do the hard work and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't and sometimes you may get the document right or wrong. We talked about upfront destinations for earners as well. So we have pivoted the company to being earner-centric, innovating for earners, thinking about the earner experience, treating earners as you know with respect and dignity and building for them versus building just for the company. This has been an activity that we've been on for a year and we feel very, very well prepared for the future. We're constantly watching supply-demand dynamics. We're constantly watching supply hours. Earner retention is improving. Engagement on the platform is improving. So we feel as good about our driver supply in general, our earner position as we ever have. That said, we know we have to improve. We have to keep increasing the number of new drivers on the platform. We're focused on resurrecting a number of drivers as well, and we're focusing on increasing engagement on the platform because earnings levels are so high. So there's a lot of work to do ahead of us, but this is a machine that's rolling. Like this, the earner team at all levels at the operational level, at the technical level, at the engineering level with ML algorithm optimizing, for example, driver incentives, all of it is rolling. And we know all of it has to work well in order for us to hit our really aggressive targets in the balance of the year. And then as far as the regulatory process and new use cases. I'd say the new use cases are us playing offense. We have seen the cross-platform initiatives throwing from one essential service to the other from Eats to Rides, from Eats to Groceries, et cetera. We know how to cross promote use cases. There's a huge amount of trust and frequency and comfort with our products. We have your identity. We understand where you are. We have your payment details, et cetera. So adding new use cases such as car rental or travel bookings or adding new supply areas like taxi, they're just natural growth areas for us. And because we've already acquired the customer because we already have built trust with our customer, we're essentially able to continue to increase engagement with our customer. The more engage our customers are, the more we retain those customers and we're able to monetize those MAPCs as a result. So it's kind of a win, win, win on that front. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is now open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Two questions, please. There's been a lot of focus on retail marketing, so at least across the industry. So could you just give us a little bit of an update on where you are in terms of putting together advertising revenue? I know you laid out a goal at your Investor Day, any update on that. And then secondly, on the MAPCs numbers, anyway to think about what the \u2013 what should happen to MAPC growth going into the next quarter? I think that was that sequential decline, I think was a lot of Omicron hit. So you back to a point where it's reasonable to expect MAPCs to grow through the balance of the year? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I'll start the second one, first, which is, we're absolutely seeing MAPC growth continue to accelerate post-Omicron. So for example, while MAPC growth for the quarter was or MAPCs were $115 million, up 17% for the quarter. In March, they were up at $120 million, up 20% on a year-on-year basis. So we're seeing MAPC growth accelerate and we expect to see that acceleration build into April and the balance of Q2. We absolutely see the reopening as a very, very big MAPC driver, especially on the mobility side, so expect MAPC to continue to grow and if anything to accelerate into the second quarter. As far as our advertising business goes, continued strength there, we essentially more than tripled the business on a year-on-year basis. And we are very much on track to hit the targets that we laid out during Investor Day. Mark Mahaney : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is now open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two, if I can. Just first, can you talk about the UK Mobility business and where that is on kind of the path back to profitability under the worker classification and VAT charges? Can the UK, do you think, get back to prior levels of profitability? And where are we on that journey? And then the second one, in the script, you talked about now expecting to be free cash flow positive for the full-year. Any update on how you think about the potential for capital return given your cash position and kind of where the shares are trading? Anything you could share that would be great. Nelson Chai : So Lloyd, I'll do the second one first, and Dara will do the UK after. As you know, we're still coming out the pandemic. We were clear early on that we\u2019re going to focus on making sure we add ample liquidity. I covered this on Investor Day to let you know that, free cash flow largely trails EBITDA by about a $1 billion a year. And so that's why we have the confidence to make the statement that we'll be free cash flow positive this year. We certainly recognize given what's going on in the market right now, and we encourage all to get towards being free cash flow positive. So we think it'll be very important as we think about this cycle. As we think about capital return down in the future, we certainly going to be open to it, right. So we recognized that we're not going to get \u2013 we don't get paid for hoarding capital. As you know, in the past, there maybe some things we want to do and we will certainly look at capital return as one of those levers. But again, I think it was important that as you think about the pragmatic walk that we've taken on capital and on liquidity importantly. And as you know, we've taken every opportunity to improve our debt in terms of the amount of both extending and reducing the debt. And so I think you'll expect to hear more about this as we go into next year, but I think it was important to get to this point where we could declare that we'll be free cash flow positive this year. And then we understand about capital return. I think if you think of our equity stakes, while they were mark-to-market down, they're very good sources of liquidity. And many of those lockup restrictions expire, if you will or come due during the course of this year. And so depending on where markets trade as well, we'll have plenty of sources to return capital. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. And I think as far as the UK goes, let's say, we make tremendous progress in the UK. We move to the worker model. We're now compliant with merchant status. And we've recently been granted a private hire vehicle operator license for 30 months, which is terrific. Our relationship with the City is second to none, and we're committed to Citycon's goal of electrifying our fleet by 2025 in London, a real leader in environmental impact and something that we're firmly behind. We absolutely believe that it is a condition for every operator's license to move to merchant. We have not seen some of our competitors do so, but the TfL has been very, very clear that they will enforce those rules. So we just think a level playfield is just a matter of time. And the ones that are ignoring the law are either accruing liability, they're going to pay for it sooner or later one way or the other. We can't tell you the timing, but it is going to happen. As it relates to our business on the ground, our CIPD position is very strong. So we're very confident as it relates to our category position and our business has returned to solid profitability. Now we see profitability in the UK, healthy and improving into the balance of the year. Lloyd Walmsley : All right. Thanks guys. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is now open. Ross Sandler : Hey, guys. Just two kind of big picture questions. First is on the delivery side. So on convenience and grocery, I think there's a debate whether 3P delivery or these new dark store concepts are a better business model. So how do you view that? I know most of your businesses started in 3P, but would it make sense to build out 1P grocery or convenience eventually? And then second question is on the taxi partnerships. So I think you said you want every taxi on the planet on Uber by 2025. Can you just talk about how those partnerships might impact the unit economics in rides? Thanks a lot. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. As far as grocery goes 3P versus 1P, our goal first of all \u2013 so as far as 3P versus 1P, I think our goal is to provide a great experience as it relates to our eaters and our shoppers who want their groceries and they want it fast. All of our data suggests that getting your groceries inside of an hour is a spectacular experience. I think there's lot of debates as to whether it's got to be 10 minutes or 15 minutes or half an hour. And if anything, we see a bunch of the 10 or 15 minute folks move to the half an hour area, which is more of where we are. We believe we can get a spectacular experience for our grocery shoppers through partnerships with our grocery partners. This is what they do day in and day out. And for example, we have a partnership with Carrefour, which is a huge player in France, where they are adjusting their model. They're taking everything that they've learned in their grocery space, years of experience, and essentially they're reducing the number of goods that they have and reducing the delivery times to that 20, 30 minutes, which is a delightful experience. So we believe that we're able to get the \u2013 essentially a 100% of experiential benefits of fast grocery through partnership and avoid the kind of capital investments that you have to make in terms of leases, opening up a bunch of stores all over cities. In addition, frankly, to the defocusing of the team, what we build, we are building a software layer on top of the physical world. That's what we're good at. We're good at matching demand and supply in a real time way. We do it more broadly, and with audiences that are unrivaled around the globe, and we think building a bunch of dark stores in a few cities doesn't make our network any better and we certainly have that the best real time network out there. So everything that we see right now, we're essentially partnering up on 1P and all the signal that we see is positive. We are in a very limited way running some tests in a few countries in Taiwan and Japan, just to make sure we understand that counterfactual because we want to be intellectually curious. At this point, we think the partnership way is a route to go. If we ever have to switch, we have the audience, we've got millions of members. So we think it's much easier to go vertical if we ever need to, but right now we don't see any signal that we should be going vertical, especially as it relates to the defocusing of the team. In terms of taxi, this one for us is we think a no-brainer, which is we've talked at the beginning of this call and a lot of folks have talked about, how bringing driver supply on in the U.S. and globally is an incredibly important initiative. We have about 4.5 million total Uber earners all around the world. There are 4 million taxis globally, 4 million taxis versus 4.5 million total Uber earners that we have. These taxis typically are underutilized relative to our earners. We think that the technology that serves these taxis can be better and were to help and partner with them as it relates to technology. We think that the days of you're going on the street and waving your arm to hail taxis, we think those days are over. Like, we think any entity that is dependent just on street hail is like a retailer who pretends that the Internet never happened. So this is the time and we're seeing taxi partners want the benefit of our technology. They want the benefit of our demand. They understand that we're all in it together, and this can be a benefit for us, it can be a benefit for taxi drivers, it can be a benefit for fleet owners, et cetera. So this is a win, win, win, and it's a big opportunity, 4 million taxis on a global basis. And we are now kind of going country by country, city by city. We're obviously excited about the announcements in New York City and San Francisco. But I want to make sure that our investors and analysts understand we've been at this for a while. Like, we've been signing up taxis in Spain and Japan and in Korea and we have built out an experience set as to how you build out the taxi product and how you optimize the experience for the rider as well. This is another benefit of our being a global company. We're coming to the U.S. with a confidence and experience that we built in Spain, Japan and a bunch of other markets as it relates to taxi. So we think it's a huge opportunity and the team is incredibly excited to get going on. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So first, Dara, given that you have a meaningful competitive advantage on the rideshare side with your driver supply position versus competitors. Now how do you think about the opportunities to gain share? I mean, it feels like you can manage consumer prices at better levels versus competition. Can you talk about opportunity to gain share? And then second on Eats, one of the fears investors have on the space, is that every product category that's our benefit from the pandemic is now seeing some form of accelerated reversal maybe due to churn or retention issues. Food delivery has been very resilient. Can you talk about what you're seeing in terms of frequency and usage underlying the bookings growth? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. As far as gaining share versus our competition, I'll tell you gaining share isn't a priority for us right now. It's happening naturally in some of the reopenings and it could be because of a mixed shift, for example, travel, the travel category is growing at very, very significant rates, and we tend to skew high on the travel category or the Uber for business category. So we are observing some share gain in the U.S. and frankly, in most countries around the world, we're observing these kinds of share gains. And it maybe that the kind of consumer that's an Uber consumer is higher end, travels a lot, travels for business, et cetera, is coming to the platform pretty quickly, and obviously we're a beneficiary of that. Our focus is on profitable growth and I think we're able to achieve profitable, call it, durable growth while gaining share versus our competitors because of the power of the platform. And so it's kind of naturally happening. It's not something that we have to lean into, and we're a lot less focused on, let's say, our competitors or competitors share as we are the opportunity to grow the business durably to add on new segments, such as taxi or hail-ables, two-wheelers, three-wheelers or lower cost product, whether it's high capacity vehicles, et cetera, that's really the focus and the share will take care of itself, although it has been taken care of itself. And we're quite constructive in terms of share gains. As far as the delivery reopening impact and frequency, listen, when you look at our delivery business, MAPCs were up 4% year-on-year, basket sizes were up 3% year-on-year, frequency was up 4% year-on-year. So all of the core metrics that drive the business are positive and because of our innovation, as it relates to bringing more earners on to the platform and then the density of the network driving cost for transaction down, we're able to improve the margins of the delivery business. So we're happy with the trends that we see, and we think that our frequency is going to also be assisted by our cross-platform usage and a higher penetration of Uber One members into our gross booking space. We are the penetration of Uber One members is still low generally for us and low compared to some of our competitors. And we see higher frequency with Uber One members. So we think that's a natural tailwind that can maybe combat some of the headwinds that some folks are seeing in the reopening. Deepak Mathivanan : Got it. Thank you so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Well, by the way, one note, I didn't answer, and I want to answer all questions. I didn't answer the question on taxi margins. So as it relates to taxi margins, first of all, margins differ by geography. So for example, in the U.S., the deals that we've done with the taxi companies should be at quite attractive margins that are consistent with the rest of our business. In some markets, let's say, in Japan or some developing markets, our taxi margins are lower, but we've consistently seen \u2013 we're able to start at lower margins and then increase margins over a period of time. So when we think about the growth of our mobility business and the 10% incremental EBITDA margins that we are looking to deliver, our core products, let's say, Uber Eats, X, or Reserve or Black, those will tend to deliver higher than 10% incremental margins. We'll use some of those, the incremental above 10% to invest in products such as taxi, three-wheelers, two-wheelers, et cetera in order to drive what I would call durable growth, MAPC growth, et cetera. And we're constantly balancing the two and hopefully you've seen as it relates to our execution over the past couple quarters and years that we have our hands on all the different levers in order to deliver very, very healthy topline growth and the kind of profitability that investors are especially looking for nowadays. All right. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Your line is now open. James Lee : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on regulatory update here. And maybe, Dara, can you talk about maybe the ongoing conversation with the New York State, given your recent wins in Washington and also pretty strong ongoing support from drivers in Massachusetts. Did these victory can help you move the conversation along? And also what are the key friction you're looking to resolve? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Hi, James, and thanks for the question. The most important factor that is helping these conversations move forward is that drivers want to be independent contractors. Drivers prize flexibility above anything. That's the reason why they earn on our platform. I think everybody knows in the U.S., if you want a job, you can have a job. If you want a full-time job, it's not a problem getting a job, but our opportunity, flexible work opportunities and healthy work opportunities is unique. You can work for us, you can work for competitors, you can work when you want, you can work where you want, et cetera. It's pretty powerful. And I think that, fortunately or unfortunately, in our Zoom world where white collar workers now have a lot more flexibility, maybe they also appreciate the value of flexibility in a way that they couldn't appreciate previously. So as it relates to New York or any other state, the good news is regulators are more and more aware that of what drivers want and drivers overwhelmingly want flexibility, and they want other protections and benefits, whether it's minimum earnings or other benefits which may change state to state to state. So I don't want to comment on New York specifically, we're having promising discussions there, but you never know when kind of the regulatory wins move one way or the other. But generally, I would say that the regulatory momentum is positive. You see that in Washington, in Massachusetts, we have a ballot initiative out there. We are very confident of our prospects in Massachusetts. And essentially, we like to see a negotiated settlement in these cities. Certainly, we'll look to have a negotiated settlement in Massachusetts, but we're confident if we have to go to the ballot, and hopefully, New York will get there, but we can't predict the time. James Lee : Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Welcome. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Take the last question, operator. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Last question. Operator : Our last question today comes from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Your line is now open. John Blackledge : Great. Thanks. Two questions. What were the mobility rides volumes in the first quarter versus pre-COVID levels? And what are the kind of the key use cases where there is headroom to close the gap, particularly as we look toward reopening in the second quarter and the back half of the year? And then just on grocery and other delivery, what was that as a percent of delivery gross bookings in the first quarter and just discuss any progress that you saw in the quarter and as we round through the year? Thank you. Nelson Chai : So our rides business has actually fully recovered versus where we were in pre-pandemic levels. And in fact, even on a trip basis, we're more than 95% recovery globally. We still have some room in the U.S. We're still in the high-70s in terms of recovery there, but we've really seen all use cases come back, including airport travel, pretty much in line with pre-pandemic levels. So we were seeing a very, very strong reopening on the mobility side. Dara Khosrowshahi : And on delivery side? Nelson Chai : As far as delivery goes, new verticals ARRs were continued to be higher than $4 billion. And we're seeing very, very strong growth there. We're also integrating the new verticals experience in a native way on Uber Eats, and we're seeing really, really promising early signal there. And when you look as of March, less than 10% of users who completed a delivery trip on Uber in the last month ordered new verticals. So there's huge opportunity there. That number is up 400 basis points year-on-year, but we think that the potential of essentially upselling new verticals opportunities to our eaters is very, very young, and there's a ton of upside left there. John Blackledge : Thank you. Balaji Krishnamurthy : All right. Great. We can wrap up there. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call and great work to the Uber team. Q1 was a super, super strong quarter. We're expecting more of that in Q2. I think this is a quarter where we're starting to show separation against our competitors in terms of execution and that execution showing up in the financials in terms of a healthy growth profile that we expect to see for some period, and also profit generation and free cash flow generation coming up this year that we're very, very excited about. So thanks everyone for joining and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Uber Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. It's now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Balaji Krishnamurthy, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Thank you, Brad. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber's second quarter 2020 earnings presentation. On the call today, we have Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi; and CFO, Nelson Chai. During today's call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, are included in the press release, supplemental slides and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com.

Such statements can be identified by terms such as believe, expect, intend and may. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements we make today, except as required by law. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today as well as risks and uncertainties described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and in other filings made with the SEC when available. We published our quarterly earnings press release, prepared remarks and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website earlier today, and we ask you to review those documents if you haven't already. We will open the call to questions following brief opening remarks from Dara. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Balaji. Uber delivered another strong quarter with gross bookings and an annualized run rate of $116 billion, an all-time high; EBITDA of $364 million, another all-time high and well above our guidance range; and positive free cash flow for the first time ever of $382 million. Despite the uncertain global economic environment and considerable foreign exchange headwinds, we've issued Q3 EBITDA guidance that shows strong incremental progression, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver healthy top and bottom line growth, strong margin improvement and yes, free cash flow, all the while continuing to responsibly invest in technical innovation, earner satisfaction and durable long-term growth. As I've said before, we continue to benefit from a secular increase in the on-demand transportation of people and things as well as a shift back from retail spend to services spend, and we continue -- and we intend to continue capitalizing on these growth tailwinds in a profitable manner. With that, let's open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. First question is from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : Just two questions. First, Dara, how would you characterize like the overall operating environment today versus pre-pandemic? You seem to be gaining category share, and a lot of the smaller competitors from private markets are retrenching, even some of your larger competitors are struggling a bit. So is life getting easier for Uber to be successful? That would be the first question. And then the second question, Nelson, the 3Q guide assumes another solid incremental margin. Can you just flesh out where that's coming from? Is that just fixed cost leverage that you expect to see over time? Or are you seeing more markets kind of reach that top 20 above target margin level that you had talked about at the Analyst Day? Nelson Chai : Ross, thank you for the question. So it's Nelson. I'll go first in terms of the guidance. So what we're seeing is, first of all, from a revenue margin perspective, a real uptick on the delivery side as we're just -- the cost per transaction is just improving. And so we're doing a really good job as a team in terms of creating efficiencies there. We're seeing gross profit improvement across both mobility and delivery. And then we are getting the fixed cost leverage that you referenced. So again, the business is operating really well right now. And again, we're really proud of the performance that we had in the second quarter. And so we expect to keep it up on the balance of the year regardless of the operating environment. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. And Ross, as far as the operating environment goes, listen, no one wishes for a tough economic environment or elevated inflation that's affecting so many of us including Uber drivers. But at the same time, from a competitive standpoint, there's no question that this operating environment is stronger for us. The -- we are able to, in this environment, I think, show our capital discipline, as you've seen in terms of the margin increase and free cash flow generation as well. At the same time, because of our scale and because we've been making these investments for years, we are able to continue to invest in our new vertical business and relaunching UberX Share and investing in hailable, et cetera. So we also continue to invest in top line so that our top line growth continues to be durable.  And in a different environment, the platform advantages that we brought, the scale advantages, the global advantages that we brought to some extent sometimes were kind of outshouted by just higher spend by competitors. So in an environment where capital discipline becomes more important, I think the larger players, and we are the largest players, the most diversified players, and we're definitely more diversified than anyone else as far as the kinds of businesses that we are and our global footprint. And then the players who have true platform advantages, which, again, as Uber, really start coming to the fore. So when we look at the competitive environment, this is the strongest we felt competitively globally since Nelson and I have probably started here. And hopefully, the overall environment will get better and the competitive environment will continue as is. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : Dara, there's obviously been a lot of discussion about increased incentives in the market, but it seems like you've been able to improve the driver experience and exercise discipline on incentives. So hope you could talk more about how you're doing that.  And then, Nelson, perhaps you can just talk about some of the interplay here in driving the free cash flow above EBITDA in 2Q and just how you're thinking about the relationship of the two over the next couple of years. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as incentives, et cetera, go, you're absolutely right, which is we've been able to apply discipline here. Listen, you can't spend your way to glory in any business. But we've really started to focus on our 3 things. One is, what are the overall earnings of drivers going to be. The second is what is the driver onboarding experience because we're adding drivers very, very quickly to the platform. And then what does the driver experience look like once they're on platform, can we retain them for longer, et cetera.  And I think the combination of all 3, our onboarding process has improved significantly, including our being able to bring on new drivers to deliver for Eats first and then essentially move them over to driving people and working for Mobility where earnings levels are higher. So our onboarding flows are much more efficient than they have been in the past, which allows us to essentially bring on more drivers at lower cost, convert a higher percentage of drivers who have shown an interest in earning on the platform. Then you've seen us invest in our driver experience chiefly with a number of new innovations, including showing your destination upfront, showing your full fare upfront, new innovations like Trip Radar. And now we're rolling out a new Uber Pro loyalty program that gets drivers up to 2% to 6% off when they use our debit card for using in buying gas. That's all about the driver experience as well.  And then on the incentive side as a result of just onboarding experience getting better drivers, being able to earn multiple ways on Uber and overall utilization being at very, very high levels, that has resulted in high driver earnings. So drivers at the U.S. who are cross-dispatching are earning about $30 an hour, which is very attractive earnings. And drivers who are in Mobility only that tends to pay higher are making $37 per utilized hour as a result of the strong economics, this is all the while our taking driver incentives down as a percentage of overall bookings as we drive more efficiency through the system. So right now, the machine is working, and we're a very, very competitive place to earn and it's showing in the driver retention numbers. Nelson Chai : Doug, on the question on cash flow. So if you recall back on Investor Day, I made the commentary that free cash flow trails adjusted EBITDA by about $1 billion annually. So I'm not updating the number for you, but I would say that we do expect that we will outperform as you see just the EBITDA margin as a percentage of gross booking improved, so that obviously helps in terms of what flows through the bottom line. We are spending time in terms of looking a little bit more at our working capital and managing it. And then again, it is important to note, it's not a direct correlation from EBITDA to cash flow because there are different financial statements, but cash flow is very much more of an annual thing. So you pay out bonuses in Q1 as an example. You get the benefit of [accrued] (ph) bonus in the rest of the quarters. So you'll see us continue to do it. I do expect that we'll do better than the $1 billion target. Free cash flow is actually a GAAP number, as you will. So it's not like adjusted in and out. And so again, we will continue to update this over time when it makes sense, but we're really proud. And we knew we would get there because think about all the steps we took during the pandemic if you think about all the platform moves now to be asset light.  Additionally, the other thing is we were doing some build-out on real estate like Mission Bay and some of the years past. So most of that stuff is behind us now. And so as you think about the business and the current operating platform, this should be a really, really strong cash flow generator, which I think you probably heard from Dara and myself over the past couple of months. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : So I have a couple of questions. Dara and Nelson, I wanted -- can you just update us a little bit on sort of where are you in the U.S. when it comes to average rider wait times versus where you have been in the past versus where you targeted to be? Anything on sort of conversion rate? Your riders go on in search and actually book a trip, how are those metrics? Anything on supply as well, I'd be curious to hear? And the new update on Uber, Uber One, 10 million users helpful? What are we seeing in terms of frequency and spend per user on the Uber One user base? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. As far as the experience, the metrics in terms of surge wait times, those experience metrics continue to move in the right direction. We're not where we want to be, but they're certainly moving in the right direction, which is now kind of surged trips in the U.S. in July. We're in the teens, about 14%. We actually have a graph in our supplementals, 14% of trips. And that's coming down from the 20s. So surge continues to move in the right direction. And then U.S. wait times are running at an average of 4.5 minutes now, and they were in the 5- to 6-minute time frame. So from that standpoint, that is a very, very nice improvement.  Again, we have more work to do ahead of us. But all of the experienced metrics are moving in the right direction. Conversion is stable now. We're looking to increase it over a period of time. So conversion is stable. And when we look at supply, the supply situation continues to improve, where the number of new driver sign-ups in the U.S. were up 76% on a year-on-year basis. So we have a very strong flow of new drivers who are signing up, coming on to earn.  And 70% -- over 70% of them have said that inflation and what they're seeing right now in terms of the cost of groceries, the cost of living plays a part in that decision for them to come on to the platform. And as you know, Uber is an unrivaled platform in terms of flexibility, being able to earn when you want, where you want. And right now, the earnings levels are quite attractive. And as we continue to work on our experience, the driver experience, better customer service, more information, we think that driving for Uber will continue to be a really attractive alternative.  So right now, the marketplace looks strong. September for us is a very, very big month. The summer months demand stays stable. And then September in Q4, it really takes off. So while right now, the experience metrics are moving in the right direction, the team is very, very focused on September, plus back-to-school and making sure that the experience remains the best ridesharing experience out there. Brian Nowak : Membership. Dara Khosrowshahi : As far as membership goes, we're very positive in terms of the trends that we're seeing. We are now at about 10 million members. Very excited about Uber One. Uber One has now been launched in 7 markets globally. And about 23% of our overall gross bookings come from members. That's 32% for delivery. Membership now is more focused on delivery at this point. Over a period of time, we're going to kind of bring in the mobility benefits as stars as well. And generally, we're seeing increased engagement as a result of being a member. Members have about 2.7x of gross bookings on Uber than nonmembers. So we think it's a pretty significant engagement lever, and it's a pretty significant LTV lever as well. So we definitely like what we're seeing with membership. I would add to that, for us, what we have with Uber is we first bring in customers, and of course, we've got the greatest front end in terms of both rides and Eats. So we can bring on more new customers than other monoline platforms. We then cross-sell customers. And then once we cross-sell customers, we move them into membership as well. So the strategic ability to cross-sell, the strategic ability for us to drive gross bookings per audience is just structurally advantaged for us, and membership is a piece of that strategy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Mark Mahaney : Two questions, please. First, can you talk about the markets that are still lagging, that are still in recovery phase and if there's anything you can do to get those markets back up? And that's on the mobility side? And then secondly, just because we've talked to so much about recession risk during this earnings season, are there any signs that you see in your businesses that -- of your segments, particularly in delivery segment of economic sensitivity? Lower ordering, smaller basket size is something that indicates that part of the business is being impacted by macro. Dara Khosrowshahi : I'll do the first one, and Nelson will do the second one. In terms of mobility markets that are still lagging, really the only ones that I would point out are in the U.S. San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle are lagging nationwide recovery. Mark, if you can get more people in San Francisco, that would help. I think it's got -- it has to do with some of these cities opened up, people going to work, et cetera. But otherwise, the recovery for us has been pretty broad, and we've been very pleased in terms of the recovery on a global basis. When we look at use cases now, the travel use case is back very, very strongly. Uber for Business, our managed business has doubled on a year-on-year basis as well. So companies are starting to travel as well, so the recovery is pretty broad. But there are a couple of cities, especially West Coast cities in the U.S. where the recovery is still trailing. But when we look overall, everything is getting better, Mark, and we expect trends to continue to improve as we go back into the second half. Nelson, you want to talk to inflation? Nelson Chai : Yes. So Mark, in terms of your second question, we actually haven't seen it, right? So we obviously look at trade down across major countries. We actually look at cohorts depending on income levels. And we haven't seen any discernible trends is what I would tell you. And we've seen more spikes and peaks more based on still COVID activity. So recently in Japan, COVID spiked and you saw demand spike for delivery. But so it's been a little bit more about still the COVID trade recovery and things that happen there than we've seen impact on inflation, at least so far. Dara Khosrowshahi : And to some extent, we could be seeing evidence where it's helping us and that it's a very significant consideration base for drivers coming on to the system. Over 70% of drivers say inflation has played a part in their decision to come on to the platform. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : A couple maybe just for Nelson. First, on the margin improvement, obviously, a big focus in the quarter. We're just wondering if you've pulled forward some of your margin improvement, or are there really changes versus your $5 billion outlook? Are you trending above that in some areas? And then the second question on delivery, I think we were looking for acceleration in the second half. Has that changed? And is that something that behavior is changing just because of the economy? Nelson Chai : Sure. So the first question regarding the '24 targets. So when we laid them out there, we had a lot of confidence in terms of our ability to hit them. And so obviously, the performance helped you to give you guys the confidence that we're going to at least hit them. Yes, we've been working -- we've been operating really well, and Dara started on it across the company in terms of managing both growth, future investment and importantly, margin and cash flow and EBITDA. And so the company is operating really well right now.  And so I would tell you that we do expect that you'll continue to see us improve both the gross margins as well as the bottom line. You'll see us continue to refocus and invest in businesses for the future and continue to improve the bottom line. And you should expect that, that ramp will continue. And so we have a high degree of confidence in terms of our ability to go do that. In terms of specifically what's going on right now, I mean, yes, we're just -- we're operating better. We don't see any on the delivery side in the back half. I would tell you that if you ask me, and this is just Nelson talking, you could see trends on the top on the delivery, but the margins will be there and the EBITDA will be there. So we have a high degree of confidence. You've heard us talk in the past about leverage that we have. And so again, we'll pull the levers. So we're going to -- definitely, we will make the guidance that we put out there, at least that's our full intention. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think just one other factor for delivery in the second half is obviously foreign exchange. That has moved against us since their last guidance. And when you look at the delivery business in the U.S., for example, Uber Eats grew 25%. Overall, in the U.S., we grew 21%. So some of the slowdown in terms of delivery growth comes from foreign exchange, and it's in a number of those European markets where we do see some of our competitors pulling back as well. But when we look overall our delivery business, that team is really executing and especially executing on the bottom line improvement. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe two topics. On Uber for Business, nice growth there. Any sense you can give us on some of the funnel of activity you're seeing broadly around Uber for Business and how that might be able to capitalize on either a return to work or return to business travel as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months? And then second, with Eats, you've invested a lot in diversification of the platform into new categories around convenience and grocery and alcohol. Can you talk about how that wider diversification of categories has maybe changed some of the velocity you've seen of shopping or changed some of the LTV of the users of Uber Eats? Dara Khosrowshahi : Eric, so as far as U4B goes, we're hugely optimistic and actually, we continue to invest in U4B sales force, et cetera. The LTV to CAC ratios are very, very attractive in terms of bringing on new sales teams. And we're really selling to significant enterprise customers out there, both in the tech space and the nontech space. A lot of these enterprises, some of them are going back to returning to office, some of them are not. But they are getting on growth.  So the champion use case that we're seeing with U4B is essentially the business traveler getting out on the road again. And obviously, a sales call over Zoom is one thing, but if the salesperson comes in to see you in person, it gives a different impression, and we're seeing our U4B clients invest in getting their teams on the road. Because as you can imagine, especially in this kind of an environment, revenue growth is becoming more dear. And so a lot of salespeople are hitting the road, and that's definitely, definitely helping the U4B business. We are also actively upselling our Eats product into U4B. So we're seeing some customers, for example, buy our vouchers product. What it may look like is you get a free lunch if you sit in this particular session to learn about, call it, some new enterprise software capabilities. And each voucher becomes a way for customer acquisition. We're seeing similar kinds of deals with online gambling, et cetera. So lots of partnerships with us as it relates to U4B and, to some extent, on the advertising side as well. As far as new verticals go, we're quite satisfied in terms of the growth of that team. It's at about a $4.5 billion run rate in terms of gross bookings. We are investing in this business. And despite investing in this business and it's in the hundreds of millions of dollars, you can see the profitability that we've been able to drive with the delivery business overall. It's really because of the scale and efficiency that we're bringing to bear. And what we're seeing with new verticals customers is that Uber Eats customers who also order from new verticals tend to stay with us, tend to have higher frequency. And it's really a part of the power of the platform that we're having. If you ride with us, if you eat with us, if you drink with us, if you order groceries with us, we just become an everyday part of your life. You top that off with the membership program. And we think we have a relationship with customers that really can't be duplicated in industry on a global basis. That's what the strategy is all about, and we're quite optimistic about our progress to date. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Lloyd Walmsley : A couple, if I can. First, in the prepared remarks, you talked about feeling good on the 2024 guidance. I guess in the interim, do you still feel good about Mobility bookings growth in '23 that's higher than '19? Or is the tenor kind of macro and the increased focus on profitability kind of take that off the table as something you want to commit to? And then secondly, can you help us understand some of the sources of the big upside to delivery incremental margins, like how much was that, it reduced investment in new verticals or the ad business scaling on the competitive environment? Any further color you can give us to help understand that and kind of how that trends looking ahead? Nelson Chai : So Lloyd, yes, we did add the statement in there about 2024. Yes, we feel really good about how the business is operating today. Yes, we can't control the macro world. And so I don't really want to give you a GB guidance for delivery for next year. But the business continues to grow well, and we are making investments. And again, we're not through the close recovery, number one. Number two, the business continues to grow well, and so we have a lot of ramp left. And so Mac and the team feel really confident in terms of our ability to grow next year. And so again, we feel really good about our competitive position and how the business is operating today and the trends down the road because the platform is operating quite well. But what I would say in terms of delivery, it's really all of the above. So I would say that we're working really hard, and that you heard in my earlier comment about the fact that our revenue margins are improving because the team, and we've worked through a lot in terms of improving just our courier efficiency or the cost per transaction, we've worked on all the different lines to try to find more efficiency, and we are doing a better job, if you will, about capital allocation in terms of promotion. And yes, you do get the benefit of the fact that some of the private competitors have gone away and some of the public competitors are getting the joke, and I understand now that a durable company has to make money. And so I think that is all positive if you think about it in terms of the margin structure and the profitability of our delivery business down the road. And so -- and yes, we continue to ramp up our ads business, and that's going quite well. So it's all of the above. And so I think we talked about it a lot on Investor Day, and we'll continue to execute our plan or over execute our plan, if you will. Dara Khosrowshahi : And Lloyd, just to go into the covers a little bit in terms of how we do this stuff. Usually, when you're driving profitability, there's a trade-off with top line, but there's actually a lot of work going on algorithmically in terms of, for example, how do we price trips on the delivery side per transaction, what percentage of trips do we batch, how quickly do our algorithms recalculate the most efficient route or the most efficient price to offer to a particular courier on a particular route.  All of those technical investments are able to drive cost per transaction down while keeping career utilization at high levels and career earnings at a high level. So there literally is no trade-off other than the time of the engineer kind of working on the algorithm. It's the same thing when we talk about upfront pricing and upfront destination for drivers, which is all things being equal, it is the #1 kind of feature that they've been asking for. There's a lot of algorithmic work that has to go into pricing that trip properly, not only taking into account time and destination, but where you're going, what the probability of getting a trip back to the center of town where you can get another trip, et cetera. It's a bunch of that work on the technical side that allows us to improve profitability and/or experience without a trade-off in terms of top line growth. That's where the magic happens, and that's what a lot of effort is going into. And that kind of effort is pretty hard to duplicate from competitors who kind of look at the service and say, well, they're doing X plus, let's do X as well. Lloyd Walmsley : It seems to be working. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, it really is. The teams are working hard, and I think that kind of under the covers work is underappreciated. And it's also very, very, very difficult to duplicate. So we love that kind of work. Operator : Your next question is from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Deepak Mathivanan : Dara, just wanted to ask about Uber Reserve. It seems like it's at a $2 billion run rate already. What is the penetration in markets where it currently is available? And then how should we think about the scaling? You know that kind of the margins are higher on this. Can you also talk a little bit about that? And then maybe one question for Nelson. It seems like Mobility take rates, if you're calculating this correctly, was down a bit quarter-to-quarter, excluding the U.K. accounting and accrual change. I know there's a lot of moving pieces from fuel pass-throughs, et cetera, but can you pass that out a little bit? And how should we think about the underlying kind of comparable take rates and then also flow through into the EBITDA margins as a percent of bookings on the rights business? Nelson Chai : Sure. So I'll answer the first one -- the second question first on the take rate. So yes, it was down in the quarter. As you know, we don't really focus on take rate. We give it to you because you guys focus on it, and it's more of an annual thing. The 2 big things was the surcharge definitely had an impact, and so that was probably 100 basis points. And then the other one is really just less surge. So you've heard us talk about the fact that we've invested in our marketplace. The health of our marketplace is better now. And so when there's less surge, it actually impacts the take rate. And so the combination of both was really what happened in the quarter. I don't know -- I don't think that you should think about a big shift in terms of take rates going forward. I think where we are historically make sense. But again, that's really just what happened in the quarter. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then as far as reserve goes, we're super excited about the product. It's one of our fastest growing products. And yes, margins on reserve on average are higher. It's more of a premium product. And part of our strategy here is to segment our customer base. We've got the largest customer base, looking for mobility services generally. And our ability to take segments of that customer base and then build products for those segments is really another scale advantage that we have that we bring to bear. In terms of reservations, it's single-digit percentage of our total trips in the markets in which it has launched. We are continuing to launch Reserve in many, many markets. And it's a combination of reserving premium cars, but also we are offering Reserve for X as well. And it's just a great experience. Like, usually, when I go to dinner with my wife and instead of us hustling down to meet the car, you know that the driver can wait for 15 minutes and it's not a problem as well. So we're seeing real consumer device as it relates to Reserve. Drivers make more money. Drivers can anchor their day, if that first morning drive and they know they're going to get to the airport and they'll get to the airport, drive back, et cetera.  So it's working as a business in terms of margins. It's absolutely driving consumer delight, and it's our fastest-growing product right now and it's growing at scale. And drivers love it as well because their earnings are higher and, again, it's an anchor for them during their day that they can preplan. So our team's doing a great job, and we'll keep rolling it out globally. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. James Lee : I wanted to get some update maybe on regulation. For example, in Massachusetts, can you talk about maybe the conversation you're having with regulators, what key issues you guys are working, can you reach a settlement since ballot is no longer available? And also in the U.K., when do you expect your peers starting to adopting the worker class, so the regulation is more equally implemented in the industry? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, absolutely. So as far as Massachusetts goes, listen, we're constantly in dialogue with legislature, with labor representatives often in the U.S. in many states as well. The polling as it related to ballot showed us clearly winning. And the reason for that is that voters know what drivers want, and drivers want the flexibility of independent contractor status along with benefits as well. And that's what we call this IC+ model, which is independent plus benefits, whether those benefits include minimum earnings or some kind of health care or accident insurance, et cetera. Those benefits are benefits that we then negotiate on a local basis, on a state-to-state basis. And we are absolutely happy and open to get to a negotiated settlement if we get there. If we don't get there, we're confident we'll take our next shot at the ballot, and we're confident in our chances. But the most important thing is that this new model, this IC+ model, is overwhelmingly what drivers want. In California, drivers are very, very happy about the outcomes there. In Washington, we got through a good negotiated outcome as well. And we continue to have dialogue all across the U.S. In terms of the U.K., we are having -- at this point, I believe that our competitors are properly charging VAT as we have been as it pertains to the model. So we're on a level playing field there. But we think as far as worker designation, there's still more work to do, worker designation again. It looks like the IC+ model that we talked about, we stepped up. And designated drivers in the U.K. as workers, we think it's the right thing to do. It's also good for business because it makes driving for Uber more attractive. And we need more drivers in the U.K. So it makes a heck of a lot of sense. We think it is inevitable that our competitors will have to do the same. This is a ruling that came straight from the Supreme Court, and we think it's the law of the land. And it's a matter of time before our competitors come into play. I will also say that the U.K. business remains healthy. U.K. margins are solidly profitable. Our competitive share in the U.K. is as strong as it's been. So the U.K. business continues to operate well. And at the U.K., it's really actually more about the rider experience. We need more drivers out there, and that's really the focus. It's about making sure that the marketplace is balanced. And I think the regulatory situation and the competitive situation are definitely headed in the right direction. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Brad Erickson with RBC Capital Markets. Bradley Erickson : Just a follow-up on the mobility side. You mentioned the driver incentives continuing to come down, certainly it seems like the labor environment flipped and what is starting to be a tailwind for you. So I guess, first, do you see those incentives continuing to fall? And then secondarily, what effect, if any, do you see any of that having on pricing here going forward? Are there any other levers you're looking to pull on pricing given any recent tendencies riders are showing elasticity-wise? Nelson Chai : Yes. So as you know, we're in 70 countries, which means we're in 10,000 marketplaces. So to make that macro statement is hard. Certainly, in the U.S., in the second quarter, that's what we saw. But again, we do operate our markets on a market-by-market basis. And we've done a really, really great job, and Dara highlighted earlier about bringing more supply on in drivers. We also continue to work to make the driver experience better, and you probably saw some of the product enhancements that we rolled out last week. And so that all helps.  And so, yes, when we lower incentives, but either through surge or just because we planned, pricing does improve for the end user, which is great. And so we like that marketplace. But again, I would tell you that there are certain marketplaces as markets start up and come at COVID that you should expect there to be some incentives. So as of San Francisco or Boston, which are 2 markets that are lagging, if you will, on the COVID recovery, you should assume that there's going to be some incentives to help drive the supply in the marketplace there and then vice versa, as markets get overheated.  And so we continue to manage that supply. We do a really good job. The team does a great job. And we do think, over time, pricing will continue to improve because our marketplace continues to improve in terms of how it's operating. But again, it's too hard to make the blanket statement. Dara Khosrowshahi : And Brad, the other thing that I would remind you of is that we don't manage incentives and our revenue margins as an output metric. We're really managing for gross bookings growth, the marketplace experience, ETA surge and then ultimately, EBITDA margins, of course. And the EBITDA margin guidance that we gave you for Q3 shows very, very healthy margins going forward. And the revenue margin number that we get to, it's almost like it's an output, it's an accidental output because we're managing to a bunch of other metrics. And a lot of what happens in revenue margin is algorithmic by nature, and it's designed to balance the marketplace while delivering strong incremental profitability for shareholders as well. So we consider incentives and revenue margins a tool. But right now, the trend as it relates to that tool continue to be positive. We are looking forward to Q4 in September, back to school. We're going to have a lot of demand, so we are preparing ourselves for that increase in demand. And so we are going to continue being in the marketplace to make sure that drivers come on to the platform, stay on the platform because Q4 is going to be a great quarter for us, and it's going to be a great quarter for them as well. All right. With that, thank you for joining the call, and a big thank you to the Uber teams. Nelson and I get to talk about this stuff, but it's as a result of a lot of hard work from our teams globally. So a big thank you from Nelson and I to the Uber teams, lots of work ahead of us. I appreciate you joining the call, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

We published our quarterly earnings press release, prepared remarks and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website earlier today, and we ask you to review those documents if you haven't already. We will open the call to questions following a brief opening remarks from Dara. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Balaji. Uber delivered yet another strong quarter with gross bookings up 32% year-on-year, EBITDA of $516 million, an all-time high and well above our guidance range and solid free cash flow of $358 million. Despite the uncertain global economic environment and considerable foreign exchange headwinds, we again issued Q4 EBITDA guidance that shows strong incremental progression and remain confident in our ability to deliver healthy top and bottom line growth with strong free cash flow generation. Underlying this performance are several trends that represent tailwinds for us. Cities are reopening; travel is booming and more broadly, a continued shift of consumer spending from retail back to services. We've seen these trends continue into the fourth quarter with October tracking to be our best month ever for mobility and total company gross bookings. With over $1 billion in adjusted EBITDA of $693 million in free cash flow so far this year, we've demonstrated how our global scale and unique advantages of our platform are combining to generate meaningful profits and we're confident in our ability to build on this momentum. With that, let's open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Dara, you mentioned the fourth quarter bookings trends. The guidance seems really solid, particularly given the backdrop. Just kind of curious, are you seeing any changes in consumer behavior or trade down or differences in what your income cohorts, how they're acting across rides, eats, U.S., Europe? Just any sign at all of weakening within the consumer of your MAPCs. That's the first one. And then the second one maybe a bigger picture one. I think if we break apart the rides business a little bit between high-frequency users and the lower frequency users, there's still a lot of MAPCs, who are pretty infrequent users, a few times a month. Can you just talk to us about sort of philosophically the next few years that the key strategy is to get those lower-frequency users using the platform three, four, five more times per month? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Absolutely. So Brian, as you can imagine with everything going on, we have been looking very closely for any signs both internally and so that we can communicate to our investors. And right now, frankly, we're not seeing any signs of consumer weakness. And part of it is that the consumer spending is strong and not only is consumer spending strong, but shifting over from retail to services and we are the beneficiary of that. So on mobility, we've looked at our mobility consumers from an income basis to see if there's any delta in behavior. We're not seeing any kind of jumps one way or the other. Seasonal trends remain the same. Even lower income riders continue to have higher trips per rider as things are opening up, showing absolutely no signs of slowing down. And we've also specifically looked at Europe with inflation with the European economies, I think leading in terms of weakness as far as the Western world. Again, we looked to see if there's any weakness and we're not observing any weakness. Really, the biggest factor that's affecting our financials is foreign exchange and the strength of the dollar that makes our stated gross bookings lower and obviously hurts our profit margins, but that's something that we've been able to overcome. When we look at delivery as well, the delivery business, as you saw, accelerated a bit against Q2. The frequency of ordering per monthly active platform consumer remains consistent, and it remains consistent not only in the U.S. and abroad as well. So while we have looked for signal, we're not seeing any signal. We're going to be cautious going forward. We're going to be cautious on costs. We're going to be cautious on overhead. But as far as the business goes, right now, we are seeing strength across the board. As far as the consumers go high-frequency, low-frequency consumers, it's absolutely true that if we can move our consumer use from lower frequency to higher frequency, we will see very significant growth. Generally, if you look at our \u2013 the number of trips per monthly active platform consumer, that has increased to an average of 5.3 from, let's say, 5.0 earlier in the year. So we are seeing higher engagement of consumers on the platform. I'd say there are three factors there. One is our membership program, Uber One, which is now well over 10 million members. We are now launched in additional markets. I think we're in eight markets now on a global basis and continue to launch. And Uber One has benefits that are unique in that they have both delivery benefits and mobility benefits as well. So Uber One is definitely a product that is driving frequency. Second for us is cross-sell. We are actively cross-selling delivery, consumers, food delivery consumers into grocery, grocery consumers into alcohol and then actually back now to mobility as well. So all of the cross-sell that we have across the platform continues to increase, drive new customers and also drive retention as well. And then for us also some of the growth initiatives that we have are designed to drive frequency. This is Hailables, taxis, two-wheelers, three-wheelers and lower-cost product as well. When you put it all together, it drives healthy gross bookings growth and generally higher frequency per audience. So we like the tools that we've got and we think there's a ton of upside for us on the frequency side. Next question. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I can. First, Dara, we saw a proposal from the labor department in the last couple of weeks and it caused a lot of volatility in the news flow around the sector. Can you give us your latest updated views on not only how that proposal might evolve, but your current state of the world in terms of the regulatory landscape with respect to the gig economy and how that might evolve in terms of a mixture of elements in your business over the next couple of years? That's number one. And then number two, maybe asking Brian's question, but pivoting it towards that delivery side of the house. I think there continues to be a lot of concern about how delivery will grow if the consumer weakens. Are you seeing anything on the consumer front that you want to flag in terms of the delivery cadence or the delivery frequency? And how should we be thinking about some of the widening out of use cases and delivery as maybe muting some of that impact in the next 12 to 18 months? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. So as it relates to the Department of Labor rulemaking, first thing I would tell you is it effectively returns us to the framework during Obama's presidency, which was a framework in which we grew significantly. And it doesn't reclassify any workers, doesn't include NAV's D-Test. So when we look at the rule making, we believe that it will provide for stability going forward. And really the focus that we have ourselves is working on a state-by-state level, right? Prop 22 in California passed with 58% of the votes in a very, very liberal state. I think everybody recognizes that value of the flexibility of independent contractors, earnings levels are very robust. And I think the dialogue that we're having on a state level, really our goal and we are finding that the dialogue is a robust dialogue on a state level about preserving flexibility, having robust earners and then also providing some protections appropriate for independent contractors is the right way forward. We continue to have dialogue. And I would say the trend is in our favor at this point, but it is the road is going to be bumpy and for us the nature of work is always going to be a big issue that we have a responsibility to shape going forward in dialogue, obviously, with local governments. When we look at delivery, again, we don't see any signs one way or the other of consumer weakness at this point. It's something that we're watching out for us. Basket sizes are up, frequency is stable. About 10% of our eaters on a monthly basis now are using our grocery product as well. So we are driving higher engagement there. And Uber One membership continues to penetrate at higher rates within our delivery segment. So you see the growth rate of delivery. It continues to be stable, et cetera, a little bit this quarter. And I think for Q4, we expect it to be stable to up a little bit as well. At this point, we're not seeing weakness. We're definitely watching out for it. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Next question please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great, thanks. I guess you've done a good job breaking down the mobility drivers in three categories. Can you help us think about delivery growth from here to get to your plan in 2024? That would be the first thing. And then we did see corporate overhead go up a bit quarter-over-quarter, I think. Could you just go through some of the drivers there? And if you can kind of keep that cost contained over the next couple of years? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. So I think if you look at delivery growth, our growth accelerated a little bit this last quarter. North America volumes remained very healthy. So North America, gross bookings grew 19%. And then in Europe, actually, we saw a slight acceleration in terms of gross bookings on a constant currency basis as well. And so I think on delivery, it's all steady on the front. The growth rate is driven based on adding in new eaters. And obviously, we have a source, a significant source, of new eaters coming in from the mobility side. Our mobility business provides as many new eaters to our eats service, Google, Facebook, TikTok combined at about q quarter of cost and it's also about merchant apps. So we are now at an all-time high in terms of the number of merchants on the platform. And the number of merchants are it's about 870,000 merchants on the platform, up about 11% year-on-year. So again, that number of merchants, that growth of merchants mirrors our gross bookings growth as well. Gross bookings growth being a little bit higher. So with Eats, it's about demand and supply, and we're adding new eaters and we're adding new merchants, which is really driving the growth of the business along with the frequency that we see with Uber One. Nelson, you want to talk about overhead? Nelson Chai : So, on the corporate overhead yes, it did increase a little bit in the quarter. We obviously continue to monitor quite closely. And so on a year-on-year basis, we actually did deliver about 20 basis points of leverage as a percentage of gross bookings. Internally what we're doing is we really are trying to focus on managing our costs, if you will, because we do recognize that the environment is a little bit more uncertain despite the fact that our businesses are operating quite well. So you should expect us to continue to be disciplined, we're going to continue to deliver the operating leverage. As you know, for us, the North Star right now is making sure that we deliver the 7% incremental margins that we talked about at a total company level. And as you know, we're ahead of that and expect to be way ahead of that as we think about full your 2022. Justin Post : Great. Thanks, Dara. Thanks, Nelson. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Thank you. Sir next question. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Doug Anmuth with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for entertain the questions. I step too on the mobility side. There is something to get just the early read on upfront fairs and destination functionality for drivers. And then second, if you could just talk about the higher mobility take rate, the 27.9%, which was up about 130 bps sequentially, the key drivers there. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. I will take the first and Nelson will take the second. Listen, up front fairs and destinations are a big positive as it as it relates to driver satisfaction. Drivers, now on a global basis, were at 2019 highs. If you look at the U.S., the number of drivers that we have is now about 80% recovered versus 2019. But the number of drivers we have is up 37%. And what we're seeing is that driver churn is down almost 20% versus where it was historically. So drivers are much more engaged on the platform. We've talked about driver earnings being $36 an hour on average in the U.S. as well. And the driver engagement, in other words, how many hours are our drivers driving on average is up 16% on a year-on-year basis. So the robust earnings, the continued flexibility and the additional information that you get in terms of upfront destinations, that is combining for very, very healthy supply trends. We can still add more drivers into the marketplace, and we're busy doing so. But the trends that we see are very healthy and the competitive trends that we see in terms of driver engagement on our platform and driver preference for our platform remain very, very high. So, the product team has really worked to improve the driver experience from onboarding, to the upfront destinations, to our customer service, to a bunch of safety innovations that we're driving as well. So there is a lot of innovation going on, on the driver front, and it's definitely showing in terms of their preference for our platform. Nelson Chai : Yes, so first of all, regarding take rate and mobility as we've talked about in the last quarter, it gets a little bit more challenging because of a business model change in the UK that occurred in March. And so our reported mobility to take rate was 27.9%. If you adjust that out the impact of the UK merchant model change, the underlying take rate would have been about 20.2%.  On the underlying basis, the take rate did increase about a 100 basis points quarter-on-quarter. And again, the underlying take rate would have been close to the 22% because the fuel charge impact was relatively constant quarter-over-quarter. As we've been trying to guide you, we actually view take rate as just one of the levers of the P&L. We really are focused on demonstrating both growth of the top line but more importantly and continuing improving margins which we're getting, the segment EBITDA margin for Mobility in Q3 was 6.6% and continuing to improve. And so really focus across a number of different dimensions. And again, we feel like we have a lot of levers to make sure we deliver against our top and bottom line targets. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Next question. Doug Anmuth : Thank you both. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open. Ross Sandler : Hey Nelson. Just wanted to follow-up on that last comment about the rides. EBITDA flow through, so the 6.6%. At Analyst Day, you guys showed that some of the top 20 markets that are performing above the long-term target already, back in February. And you've seen this EBITDA margin go up several hundred basis points this year. So could you just talk about like, what's pulling up the overall, is it that those top markets that are in the top 20 are going up even further than 13%, or is it the ones that are kind of below the average closer to break even moving towards that long-term goal? Like any color on what's driving the EBITDA margin improvement in rides? And do you guys think it's still 11% in the long-term, or could it be potentially higher? Thanks a lot. Nelson Chai : So, we talk about 10%, and that's the number we've kind of talked as a guide. I would say it's across the board. So, what we're seeing is we are getting leverage because : a) we're managing our cost base; b) we've talked a lot about some of the investments made last year in terms of bringing the supply on. So we're able to be more efficient in terms of adding that supply. And so it's really across the board. Those top markets that I kind of highlighted continue to do extremely well. And next year we have a number of countries that are above that 10% number. And the ones that are below are continue to improve. And so we've just seen an overall improvement in our marketplace. Our business is actually going quite strongly across all of our key geographies right now. And again, it's a lot of the confidence we have if you think about our ability to put out our quarterly targets and then overachieve against it, particularly on the bottom line as you've seen this year. And again, if anything as we think about our 2024 targets we're three quarters into laying out those numbers in February. We've largely hit them on the top line. We've over exceeded them on the bottom line. The business is operating quite well. And so we probably are more confident in terms of hitting that bottom line number as you think about three years out. But it's not just because folks below the 10% or above the 10%, it's actually the overall marketplace and how the business is operating right now. Dara Khosrowshahi : And Ross, I just add that we're able to drive this kind of incremental margins, the healthy incremental margin while we continue to invest in some of the newer products in the mobility portfolio. As we invest in taxi, as we invest in reserve, as we invest in U4B high capacity vehicles, shared rides, et cetera. So we are actively reinvesting in growth levers, but the base business is inflecting and is showing very, very strong leverage that allows us to invest in new products while we're delivering higher profitability, as Nelson had said. Balaji Krishnamurthy : All right. Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two if I can. First just given all the questions around macro, are there enough levers in the business on the cost side in kind of rationalizing competition such that you're confident in the 2024 EBITDA targets, kind of regardless of macro? And then second one somewhat related, Lyft recently retired their energy surcharge and added a new charge to pass along higher insurance costs. Do you think a similar course of action might make sense for Uber? And what could that mean for the P&L? Thanks. Nelson Chai : Okay, so first of all, in terms of leverage, yes, so we've been telling you this, and if you think about the leverage that we're able to pull as Dara said, we're able to continue to improve and deliver or over-deliver against the 7% incremental margins to the company level, while we're investing in some growth bets. And so, frankly, we're probably more confident in terms of delivering the 24 EBITDA number as we sit here today in November versus even February, because again, we have three quarters of data behind us. And including the part of the macro environment is also the competitive environment and so we are operating quite well right now. So yes, we think we are very confident in terms of delivering the 24 EBITDA number. In terms of the Lyft surcharge what I would tell you is we obviously know what they are doing. We pay close attention. We are not making any change at this time. It's not that we wouldn't at some point, it obviously would have a beneficial effect, but again, we are trying to balance our marketplace, make sure that we continue to drive an official marketplace. And as you can tell by our results we are delivering very, very strong bottom line as well as top line. And again, we'll continue to evaluate. But again, we're not going to make a change based on something that they're doing. Dara Khosrowshahi : And Lloyd, just add to that, right now the focus of the business is really to improve our supply situation. And that's kind of where we're waiting some of our investments. Earnings from our earners on a global basis were $10.8 billion, up 25% all-time high on a global basis. And our job is to run a lean operation where we can deliver as much earnings as possible to our drivers and couriers on a global basis, and also obviously be responsible to our investors. So right now, exactly as Nelson said, we like where we are and we're going to focus on our own strategy versus some of our competitors\u2019 strategy. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay, thank you. Balaji Krishnamurthy : You are welcome. Next question. Operator : Your next question is from Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So a couple ones. First, can you unpack the Eats\u2019 incremental margins in 3Q? It's continuing to be very strong, even as you kind of calmed through the investment period last year. Can you elaborate the factors driving cost per trip down? Is it more sort of like a batching and changing with scale that's happening on the platform or are there any other linked factors? And then second question, Dara, maybe can you talk about some of the kind of counter cyclical elements, potentially helping driver supply with macro becoming weaker across the world in certain countries? Are you starting to see sort of like the driver supply and ours being helped by weakening macro in certain regions? Nelson Chai : Okay, so first of all, Deepak, I'll take the first part. So, as you know we made a very conscious pivot towards expanding delivery profitability faster than we previously planned. And if you look at what we've delivered this year as well as what the guidance is in the Q4 that will play true. We benefited both from some work that our tech team has done in terms of improving our courier efficiency. And so that is probably the single biggest driver in terms of operating, in terms of driving incremental delivery margins. And then secondarily, we still have a fair amount on the incentive line. The competitive environment has gotten more constructive if you will as a lot of our competitors are also trying to follow our lead and trying to drive profitability, and then the ones that are not public, as you know, the funding margins that have changed. So we really are competing much more on platform. And so you are seeing the benefits of that as you think about both our growth, but importantly our EBITDA margin progression. And so you should expect us to continue to drive that because as Dara said, internally, we are committed to managing our cost base and really making sure we get leverage off of our scale platform. Dara Khosrowshahi : Deepak, in terms of driver supply that is getting healthier across the board on a global basis. I think there are a couple factors. One is we lean into driver supply. So driver incentives while they are easing continue to be at high levels. We are investing billions of dollars in driver incentives to bring drivers on board. Second, is we have invested significantly in our onboarding flows, auto fetching documents as opposed to your having to take pictures of your documents, improving the conversion of driver signups to actually drivers getting onboarded and making that first trip as well. There is a ton of tech work that has gone into those onboarding flows. And then I do think the macro environment does seem to be helping combine with the solid earnings that we're seeing. Right? Average driver in the U.S. making $36 per engaged hour, those are very, very healthy earnings levels; and in the U.S. at least over 70% of our drivers who are coming on-board now said that inflation did play a role in their decision to sign up, right? It helps them afford their groceries, be more comfortable in an environment where real wages are fairly weak as it relates to the inflationary environment. So we do think the macro environment is helping, although I do think that the investments that we made both in technology and behind driver incentives are also a pretty important factor as well. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Next question, please. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. I wanted to ask two product productivity questions. The Uber One, what do you \u2013 what else can you do to make the Uber One value proposition more compelling, such that you go from 10 million customers \u2013 members to 20 or 30 million? Like what are the big unlocks ahead on Uber One? And then secondly, you talked about driver supply is now back on par with mobile; the active drivers is back on par with September 2019 levels and that you've seen improvement in things like surge in ETAs. Are surge in ETAs are those metrics back to where they were back then and if not what still needs to be done to kind of continue to improve the performance, the productivity of mobility to get it back to where it was and to get it improved from today? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Absolutely. So Mark, the one thing that I would stress is we think Uber One is already there. Like we're always trying to improve the product as well, but remember, this is a \u2013 this is a very young product. We're still launching markets, so we're now in eight markets and it is the only product out there we price competitively with other players who are \u2013 who are offering delivery only benefits. And we are offering delivery benefits that are just as strong as their competition and discounts ranging from 5% to 10% on the mobility side, which is a far superior proposition especially as markets are opening up as well. So we're confident with the product as we have it, to be able to go from 10 million to 20 million to the 30 million that you put out there. The product is already there. Now we are going to invest in experiential benefits. Do you get priority pickup in airports? Do you get priority matching for example during an event? Those are definitely benefits that we are going to experiment with, but Uber One as is, is the best membership product out there on a global basis. And obviously with the audience that we have, we have a mobility audience and a delivery audience and a grocery audience that we can put \u2013 that we can push Uber One in terms of a marketing audience. We think that 20 million, 30 million on a matter of time. In terms of surge and ETAs, they are coming down. Generally I would say surge levels now are running as a high-20s to 30% range. We're more comfortable with range, call it in the teens. ETAs on average are running call it six minutes and we are more comfortable in the five-minute range. What it takes to get to those levels is simply continued investment and supply. And we are seeing our supply improve and generally supply hours are growing at very healthy rates, which is a function of new drivers on-boarding but then the average driver who's on-boarded being engaged at a higher level than they were last year. So as we improve the supply demand balance of the marketplaces and we're well on our way, we think we'll get surge levels below 20% and ETAs closer to five minutes, the \u2013 directionally we're confident where we're going. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you, Dara. Balaji Krishnamurthy : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Dara, I wanted to follow-up on a question earlier on Upfront Fares and Destination. And I think in the past you recently you talked about just variables that go into pricing more so than just time and distance. So can you talk to us a little bit more about just the variables on the algorithm besides time and distance on Upfront Fairs? And then we haven't talked much about advertising here, but $350 million run-rate charging $1 billion by 2024, a bunch of launch at this quarter. Talk to us about what's needed from a tools and maybe verticals or sales force perspective to get to that $1 billion? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. Sure, Ron. So time and distance there are definitely variables. One variable is the supply of drivers in that location, right? If there are a lot of drivers in that location, you can price the triple lower or if the supply drivers is low in that location then you're going to have to price up as well. We will also predict the chances of their being another ride at the destination as well. So is the driver going to have a large amount of dead head miles call it, in which case we would price up? If it's highly likely that the driver will have another ride so that utilization is high then we would price that ride lower. And then also some of the basics, right? How far does a driver need to drive for the pickup? If it's half a mile, then price might be lower. If it's call it five or six miles then the price will be higher as well and then also our ability to show the upfront fare and our looking at what's access rate is for those upfront fairs, give a signal into a pricing algorithm that wasn't possible with time and distance previously when we were time and distance it is what it is. Drivers will accept or they won't actually in that case they will cancel if they didn't like the destination. Now we see live signal as to \u2013 is our pricing working or not based on driver acceptance rates, and that goes into the algorithms that determine pricing as well. All of this is combining to a higher throughput marketplace with higher satisfaction on the driver \u2013 on the driver's side as well. So we're pretty happy about the signal and it's clearly something that drivers love. In terms of advertising we're very confident the targets that we put in terms of getting to $1 billion were based on what we think are conservative assumptions. We see competitors out in the marketplace with advertising dollars as a percentage of gross bookings of 2%, $1 billion 2020 \u2013 by 2024, and implies numbers that are short of that 2% number. So we think even if we get to the $1 billion, we think we will have growth in advertising beyond that. We are now excited to open up new services \u2013 new surfaces on the advertising front, our Journey Ads that we have launched that opens up the mobility surface. We are getting very, very excellent engagement as far as mobility consumers with those ads, and we're tracking some pretty premium advertisers onto that surface as well because of the unique surface that attracted very high demo as well. So we are well on our way to that $1 billion, and I think, again, the $1 billion is not the high point of that business; the $1 billion is just one step along the way to building a multi-billion dollar business for us. Ron Josey : Thank you, Dara. Balaji Krishnamurthy : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Blackledge with Cowen. Your line is open. John Blackledge : Hi. Great. Thank you. Two questions; first just could you discuss Uber's market share position in both mobility and delivery? And then on mobility could you talk about the volumes compared to the highs pre-pandemic? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. In terms of our category position and mobility and delivery, we operate all around the world, but if I were to generalize on mobility, our category position is very strong. We are at close to if not at all time highs in U.S., Australia, the UK particularly is very, very strong with us \u2013 strong for us as far as category position goes. And then on the delivery side we have improved our category position quarter-on-quarter and either we've been stable or improving our category position across 75-plus percent of our gross booking space, and in the last month we believe that's only improved. So we are in a position now because of the scale of the business, because of the global nature of the business and the power of the platform where mobility is pushing, is sending consumers to delivery and vice versa, we're able to gain category position and improve margins pretty significantly, which is great. Second question? Nelson Chai : So in terms of recovery, so we're more than 100% recovered versus pre-pandemic levels globally on mobility. And we're about 94% recovered on a trip basis globally. So again, the business come back nicely and again we see pretty good runway ahead of us. John Blackledge : Thank you. Balaji Krishnamurthy : We will take one last question please. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Thank you. So our work suggests that delivery only users in Europe and we use UK as a proxy, but are multiples higher than mobility only users. I guess, can you elaborate what do you think you need you do to convert these delivery only users to mobility users? Or do you think there are structural differences in transportation in Europe versus the U.S.? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. So I think in terms of those users it's really the platform, so we are now offering mobility promos, for example, to delivery users who either have churned or mobility users who've never used mobility before. And we're seeing really great promise in terms of delivery actually being able to cross promote and drive mobility use cases as well. And then Uber One is the other product that we have. Obviously the lead benefit for Uber One is free delivery, discounts on your delivery as well but the mobility benefits are benefits that we can promote in Europe and other markets. And when you look at UK for example, a much higher percentage of our mobility business is let's say in London, while the delivery business is not just in London, but is in a number of other cities, the Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle et cetera of the world as well. So we think the power of cross promotion, we started with mobility really promoting delivery. So we think delivery promoting mobility back is absolutely a potential that we have that we're very early in terms of developing. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Well thank you everyone for joining. We are very, very happy to deliver another healthy quarter of strong top line growth and strong bottom line growth as well. Nelson, Balaji and I get to talk about it but there are thousands of Uber employees who are doing the hard work on the ground. So special thank you to them and then of course our earners with whom we won't be here talking to you. Look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

We published our quarterly earnings press release, prepared remarks and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website earlier today. And we ask you to review those documents if you haven't already. We will open the call to questions following brief opening remarks from Dara.  With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Balaji. Uber delivered our strongest quarter ever in Q4, with gross bookings up 26% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA of $665 million exceeded the high-end of our guidance for the sixth quarter in a row and we delivered strong incremental adjusted EBITDA margin of 12%. We reached several new milestones this quarter. We crossed 2 billion quarterly trips, and our Mobility consumer base exceeded 100 million for the first time in our history. At the same time, we're laser-focused on making Uber the best platform for earners, with over 5.4 million people earning on Uber around the world, another all-time high. Put simply, the Uber platform has never been stronger and we're making great progress building on our platform advantage through advertising and membership. Despite any macroeconomic uncertainty, I'm more confident than ever in our prospects. We're entering the year with great momentum. Mobility trip growth is accelerating and Delivery remains resilient. But we are far from complacent, and we'll continue to hold ourselves to high standards of growth and profitability to deliver yet another record year in 2023. With that, let's open it up to questions. A - Balaji Krishnamurthy : Angela, please queue up the questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. Maybe two questions, if I could. Dara, as you think forward to 2023 and you sort of aligned an array of products between Delivery and Mobility, how should we be thinking about Uber One as a subscription product? And elements of either leaning in behind growth and pushing adoption of the product to create a wider moat around the collection of assets you have versus maybe just letting virality build around the subscription product. How do we think about active versus passive approach to driving the subscription element of the business? And then obviously, one of the more recurring themes during earnings season has been elements of continued efficiency and cost cutting within organizations. You guys have laid out an incremental margin strategy, but how should we be thinking about your broader views on efficiency inside the organization, especially with respect to some of the corporate costs inside the company's cost structure? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, absolutely, Eric. So in terms of Uber One, we think Uber One is a terrific membership program. It's the only one. If you think about the Uber One benefits, we think about that as content. So Uber One has the best content in terms of Mobility subscriptions and movement subscriptions than any other similar subscription. We got over 12 million members up, with membership having nearly doubled for 2022, which is terrific. And our efforts here are quite active. I mean, we are pushing Uber One. You'll see it on our delivery services. You'll see it on our Mobility service. And we are quite actively continuing to innovate in terms of the benefits that we offer, and the results are pretty spectacular. Members spend monthly 4.1 times the amount that nonmembers do on a monthly basis. So it creates great stickiness. And member retention is 15% greater than non-member retention.  So in-period, in the initial months in which we acquire a member, that member is actually loss-making because the discounts that we offer are greater than the in-period value of that 4.1x. But over the lifetime of the member, the membership creates a significant moat and a significant growth opportunity for our business. You will see membership counts continue to increase. And you'll see the percentage of our bookings coming from membership continue to increase as well. Globally, about 25% of our gross bookings come from members. In the U.S. for example, 40% of our Delivery gross bookings come from members and it's a moat that we will continue to actively develop. Nelson, do you want to talk about cost? Nelson Chai : Sure. So Eric, for us, as you probably recall, our call to action moment was actually in 2020. And if you recall back then, our Mobility business was over 85% of the company's gross bookings. And as we sat here in April of 2020, that business was down 80%.  So as you recall, we acted pretty decisively during that time, we took over $1 billion of costs out of our infrastructure. We shuttered down a bunch of businesses. And unfortunately, we did have to let go over 20% of our headcount.  So we've been really focused on efficiency since then. I think you've heard us lay out our plans, and I think Dara mentioned on CNBC, in 2021, we wanted to really push hard for EBITDA profitability, and again, we achieved that metric in 2021. Last year, we talked about being free cash flow positive at some point in the year. And again, we achieved that metric. And now, we're talking about being GAAP operating profit at some point later in the year. And we expect to continue to achieve that metric. Now we've done this -- and you mentioned incremental margins, we've done this because we focused efficiently on cost, and we've been laser-focused on it. So our headcount will largely be relatively flat this year. And even if you go back to the build that the many companies had over the past few years, we've grown our headcount about 10%, excluding the Freight business, over the period of time. And our gross bookings went from $62 billion in 2019 to $115 billion last year. So just think about that growth and efficiency. Where we've hired heads has been in some areas of tax, selectively, as well as some sales folks on the Delivery business. And you can see that it's certainly been beneficial. So our goal is really to drive the incremental margins we laid out last year at Investor Day. I think we've overachieved against all of the metrics on the profitability side. And again, as Dara mentioned, the year started off quite well, which is why you saw us raise guidance for the first quarter. And we're going to just continue to leverage our cost base, which is driving the incremental margins that you're seeing the throughput on. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thank you. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one on frequency and engagement on the platform. You've made really good progress. Now you're, I think, 5.4 trips per month versus about 5 last year, but still below I think the peak levels Dara used to talk about in 2019. I guess the question on frequency is, where have you made the most progress, sort of getting that frequency per rider up? And how do you think about the key drivers throughout '23 to sort of get that back to 2019 levels and beyond? And then the second one is on the incremental margins. The Delivery incremental margins continue to deliver above your Analyst Day targets. Anything we should think about that are sort of one timish in nature or different competitive dynamics as to why the incremental margin in Delivery shouldn't stay at these elevated levels as we go throughout 2023? Thanks. Nelson Chai : So I'll handle the first one -- -- I'll handle the second part of that. So if you think about the incremental margins on the Delivery business, yeah, we've been very pleased with the throughput. It's been about over 20% if you think about last year. And it's really been driven by three areas, right, maybe four. But we really did focus on efficiency in the marketplace. And we have benefited from the fact that a lot of the players are trying to follow our path to profitability, especially the private companies as external money has been harder to come by. So that benefit has certainly been there, and we believe that will continue. Our own technology gains on really improving the efficiency of our cost per transaction. And I think you'll recall, we talked about it a fair amount in our third quarter call where we saw a little bit of a step function improvement there. And so we -- again, we expect that to do, and that's on batching and things like that, and we've seen the benefit on that. And then frankly, we've augmented the margins on new business. And so our Ads business continues to outperform the targets that we laid out. And so the combination of all three of those is really driving the incremental margins that you mentioned there. And so we don't necessarily see them changing so much. The pace of the improvement will -- certainly will slow down. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then in terms of the frequency of trips, there are really four factors that I would point to. First of all, we just talked about our membership program. As we increase the number of members in our member base and the coverage of members who tend to buy more, who tend to buy more frequently, just mathematically, you're going to drive frequency up.  Second for us is the power of the platform. We are constantly cross-promoting between Mobility and Delivery, and essentially sending free or cheaper traffic from one platform to the other in a personalized targeted way as well. And so you should expect more opportunities for us to upsell and cross-sell in an intelligent way driven by AI and machine learning.  The third is the breadth of the product that we offer. So for example, with Mobility, with Reserve and low cost, Reserve has been a huge shift for us. And we estimate that 50% of Reserve trips are actually incremental, they wouldn't have happened otherwise. The other 50% are upsell, so to speak. They are more profitable than on-demand trips.  Grocery is another example of new products that we are adding on at higher selection, driving higher frequency as well.  And then last and certainly not least is the reopening, right? The shift of spend from products to services is benefiting us. So there is a tailwind in terms of people getting out, people shopping more, people going out to dinner more, et cetera, and that is helping our business as well. So it's really membership, platform, new products, and then the macro environment that's helping frequency. And we expect to see that frequency, that 5.4%, continue to increase over a period of time. And there's no reason that I see why we shouldn't hit or exceed our all-time highs over a period of time. Brian Nowak : Great. Thank you both. Balaji Krishnamurthy : You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : Hey, guys. Just a question about the upfront fare and upfront destination technology that you shipped. So you noted in the letter that you saw about a 4% increase in conversion. So I guess just some context around that. How does this innovation compared to others that you've shipped in the past in terms of like magnitude of overall impact? And as you look forward over the next couple of years, do you see other technology updates that -- in the future, that could be as impactful as what you've done with upfront? Thanks a lot. Dara Khosrowshahi : Ross, it's very difficult to predict impact. But I will tell you that the upfront destinations and upfront fares has been one of our largest releases ever. It takes a huge amount of work in the background in terms of training models, testing it out in various markets to make sure that we got it right. And it was the number one requested feature by driver partners. They want to know what the upfront fare is going to be. They want to know what the destination is going to be. It's an important part of the information that drivers process through as to whether or not they want to accept a particular trip or not.  And it has just been a home run for us in terms of the number of trips that are -- that we're able to drive through the marketplace or the improved throughput in the marketplace, reduction in cancellations, because drivers now know upfront whether or not they are going to accept or not. This is a feature that we are now expanding around the world. So we've launched it in the UK now, outside of London. And for example, we see a much higher percentage of fulfillment rates than we did previously. And now we're carefully rolling out in London, and we will continue to roll it out market by market by market. So difficult to predict what our engineers are going to come up with. We're very, very happy with this feature. But I would never underestimate the power of our engineers at Uber. So hopefully, we will have another hit like upfront fares coming up. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. Two questions, please. You talk about the impact of these newer Mobility products. Which of those, in particular, would you single out as having the most impact? And then just talk about the timing of rolling out upfront fairs and destinations globally. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, absolutely. So I'd say the biggest one for us has been Reserve. If you look overall at the portfolio of new products that we've introduced, those new products accounted for about $6 billion of EBITDA -- sorry, gross bookings, I wish it were EBITDA, but gross bookings for the quarter, and it's about 20% of our growth. And that portfolio is growing at about 100% year-on-year. So it will continue to be a larger and larger portion of our overall bookings. And Reserve is the biggest one. We talked about it being over $2 billion. It is a terrific product, especially as travel opens up.  Typically, if you think about traveling to and from the hotel and then coming back, there are about four trips that are available to us. And we capture 1 to 1.5 of those trips. So we think there's still a significant runway for us to continue to grow Reserve. I am also very, very interested personally in our low-cost product. This is UberX Share, the opportunity for two or three passengers to get into the car. It's more efficient for the marketplace that's better for the environment. And our dream is to have all of our trips shared in an EV. That would be a beautiful thing in terms of congestion and in terms of the environment as well.  And then last and certainly not least is hailables, right? They are two wheelers, three wheelers, but especially taxis. There are over 20 million vehicles that are hailable vehicles in the world, about 4.5 million taxis. It's a huge base of drivers and vehicles that we think we should power -- Uber should power, because we are the number one kind of source of on-demand movement in the world. And ultimately, we want to wire up every single vehicle, whether it's a car or a delivery vehicle or a truck or van or a bus, that's available to move people or things all around the world and taxis and hailables are a big part of it. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : Yeah, thanks for taking my question. Maybe one for Dara and one for Nelson. On the outlook for '24, I think there's been some headwinds from FX and some other things. Any updates on that, and maybe some of the puts and takes as you think about that, that you gave last year?  And then, Nelson, a couple of the cost issues maybe in the quarter. The New York minimum driver fee changes and insurance costs, maybe you could cover those and how you're thinking about the potential impact in '23. Thanks. Nelson Chai : Well, maybe I'll try to answer both of them. So in terms of the FX, I mean, we do give you constant currency numbers. The FX has gotten better right now. We don't necessarily put that into our '24 as we're thinking about '24. We laid out guidelines last year, as you recall. We think we've overdelivered against it, particularly on the bottom line, the incremental margins and the profitability. Our focus is to make sure we continue that path. And again, we are focused on trying to deliver GAAP operating profit at some point this year. And again, we think that we will continue to do well versus the targets we laid out. In terms of some of the costs, those are things that we just have to continue to mitigate. Specifically on New York, a lot of it just has to with transparency, a lot of it just has to do with making sure that the rule set is correct. The new 6%, again, it will get absorbed into the marketplace.  And then your question on insurance. Insurance, I would tell you is the one line item because we've worked -- we've scrubbed our whole company on every single line item. And that's the one line item that we frankly haven't made progress on in terms of reducing the cost per trip. A lot of it is just built on what's going on more broadly in the insurance industry as the market continues to be a hard market. A lot of it has to do with the fact that, I think, even the insurance companies are having the challenges now to do the actuarial work. Because to repair a car is much different, right, the rearview mirror that was $70 is now $700 with all the electronics.  And so we, frankly, and obviously, our earners, are part of that ecosystem. As you know, we take our charges in the quarter when they come. We've done a good job managing through that. But again, I think insurance will be continue to be the one item that we haven't been able to optimize, and Dara spends a lot of time working with me and our teams on how we go do that. But if you think about every other line of our P&L, we've actually done a pretty good job in terms of driving efficiencies out, and we'll continue to focus in on that. Dara Khosrowshahi : And just I realized that I neglected to answer Mark's second question in terms of the rollout of upfront fares and destinations. It is -- this is a very complex product that we're rolling out, and we have to make sure that our models are properly trained. So we are in the middle of a rollout in the UK, and we'll continue to roll them out across major markets where appropriate. I would expect that upfront fare and destination will be rolled out in all of our markets globally by the end of the year, in markets in which we can roll it out. Depending on regulatory issues, et cetera, we may not be able to roll it out in various countries. But I would expect a full rollout by the end of this year in markets where it's appropriate. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Next question, please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to circle back on the Delivery margins. Can you just help us, Nelson perhaps split out some of the improvement across network efficiencies, advertising and marketing incentive optimization? Thanks. Nelson Chai : No. So look at it, we're focused on delivering the incremental margins that we laid out. We certainly have delivered way above what we've been talking about long term. We expect to continue to try to deliver against the 7% total company, and we're going to continue to look for efficiencies across. And so what I try to do there is let you know that some of them were very deliberate actions that we took in terms of making sure that we are running and the marketplaces are running more efficiently regarding incentives. Some of it is just tech that we deployed. And we deployed the tech in the first half of last year, and we really saw those benefits on the cost per trip. And then again, we've talked about some new business things. And so Ads is the easiest example, where we've seen that continue to grow. So the Ads business, we continue to -- expect to continue to grow and accelerate the growth, and so we'll see the benefits in the margins. I think we'll continue to run an efficient marketplace. And so yeah, I think you should expect that we'll continue to drive margins in those businesses. But remember, we also spend time trying to invest back in. So we've invested and we've talked about it. There's some growth markets like Japan that we've invested in. And again, we now are number in Japan from a category position perspective.  So we try to manage -- we're going to balance both the growth as well as the margin and the profitability. And I don't want to be too prescriptive in terms of exactly how -- what we're doing. Dara Khosrowshahi : And I think just on Ads, for folks out there, we passed $500 million in annual run rate, and that's based on increasing the number of active advertisers that we have, like 80% on a year-on-year basis. But if you look at the merchant penetration, the percentage of merchants on our Delivery side who are advertising, only 25% of our merchants are active in the auctions that we have going on. So we think there's substantial upside to our advertising business. We committed to $1 billion in revenue by 2024, and we are progressing very, very well against that target. So you should expect to see more upside, both, by the way, in our Delivery business, but also in our Mobility business, we've seen some really encouraging signal as it relates to Journey Ads on Mobility, which you see on the app, put through rates over 3%, CPMs of $45, which is pretty amazing.  And then a new class of a that we're actually pretty excited about our car tops and tablets, where the goal of those advertisings is really to put more dollars in drivers' pockets. We'll run the advertising networks. We'll sell the products, et cetera. But the goal of those products essentially is to get drivers greater earnings on a monthly basis, which then will translate into more drivers on the platform and a more dependable Uber for everyone. And that works out for the marketplace and it works out for us as well. Doug Anmuth : Thank you both. Dara Khosrowshahi : You bet. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the question. So first, on the weekly active user penetration, it seems like in some markets like UK, you're already above kind of the pre-COVID levels, but it's still below in large markets like U.S. Is there any broad reason for this lag on the user side? And how should we kind of think about this in two.  And then for Nelson, as we go into the kind of annual comp cycle, I had to be the guy that asked the SBC question, but how should we think about the target compensation levels in 2023? Any high-level color you can share on your thoughts there would be helpful. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. I'll start on the user trends and then Nelson can talk SPC. The reason for the U.S. trailing is really the West Coast. So if you look at the U.S., it's really a tale of two coasts. If you look at a Miami or a New York and an Atlanta or off the coast, in Austin, Houston, et cetera, most of the U.S. is at pre-COVID levels. Canada, for example, our neighbors in the North, are above 2019 levels as well. But it really is the San Franciscos, Seattles, Portlands, Los Angeleses of our country on the West Coast that are trailing and are off the pace that we see pretty much everywhere else in the world. So I wouldn't generalize the U.S. Kind of non-West Coast looks great. The West Coast is recovering. And we talked about in January, we are having, on a daily basis in Mobility in the U.S., trips approach pre-COVID levels as well. So all the trends are moving in the right direction, but the West Coast is definitely leaving the U.S. behind the recoveries on a global basis. Nelson Chai : So regarding stock-based comp. So we are looking at all parts of our cost structure, including employee compensation. We recognize, and there is a fair amount of noise particularly on the West Coast regarding stock-based compensation. What I would say is that we expect our employment levels to be -- our headcount will be relatively stable this year. We will continue to focus on performance management across all of our businesses. And so you saw that we took some action in our Freight business in January and now specific to the Freight in the marketplace. And there'll be some other pockets of that, that will happen during the course of the year. I think you won't see any demonstrable change in stock-based comp because it takes a long time for that to build out. But we are certainly going to manage our headcount very judiciously.  And then the only thing I would add is that, because we are trying to start focusing in on GAAP operating profit, it obviously is part of the calculation. And so we recognize that as well. And so as you think about the progress we've made on EBITDA and free cash flow, and now with our focus there, you can envision the amount of focus that, that line will have as we move forward. Deepak Mathivanan : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two, if I can. First, just on Uber One. You talked about a strong pickup in spend and clearly like a nice LTV that covers CAC pretty quickly. But once you're through that kind of start-up cost, what would contributions look like for Uber One members versus like a non-member? And how much of a trade-off is the margin for the profit dollars in that plan? And then secondly, do you think the driver supply is benefiting at all yet from slower economic growth? And to the extent we're seeing some of that or eventually see that, how do you think about pricing and take rate on the Mobility side, if you get better and better supply? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. Look, Lloyd, I don't want to get into too much of the particulars of Uber One on because as you can imagine, a bunch of information, the data there is proprietary. But if we get an Uber One member who sits around for a year, that Uber One on member generally will be unprofitable. It's really in the second year where that Uber One member will be profitable, and that's just a trade-off between frequency, order average order value and margin. And we're actively making that trade-off and driving Uber One penetration. Another side benefit of Uber One is that our merchant base, an increasing percentage of our merchant base in our Delivery business is willing to pay to have, let's say, advantage exposure to the most valuable members that we have as it relates to the Uber One audience. And as you can imagine, the Uber One audience is a high-demo audience that moves, that spends on services, that gets out of house, and it's a very, very attractive demographic, both for our merchants and for advertisers as well. In terms of driver supply, driver supply levels are very, very healthy, right? Drivers are up 35% on a year-on-year basis. New driver count is up 34% on a year-on-year basis. And we have heard from our drivers that inflation is a factor that they consider, about 70% of them that are coming on to the platform are coming on to make more money so that they can afford to live in what has been an inflationary world. So we certainly think that the economic environment could be a tailwind there. And in markets where we have seen economies get weak in the past, and Mexico has been through some recessions, Brazil has been through some recessions, we definitely see weaker economic environment helping out in terms of our driver supply that is a tailwind in terms of trip volumes.  It's difficult to tell if that's what we're seeing. You'll remember that for 24 months now, we have been very, very focused on improving Uber as a platform for our earners. Come on in quickly, make a lot of money delivering quickly. Then once we have -- then we'll upsell you to driving driver earnings are $35 per utilized hour. So they're at very, very high levels. Driver earnings increased by 37% on a year-on-year basis in terms of constant currency.  So I think just the earnings levels and the service that we are providing our drivers is a tailwind. In addition to the economic environment out there. And we put it all together, it results in a service where surge levels are coming down. So surge levels in January, for example, in the U.S. are under 20%. ETAs are coming down. ETAs in the U.S. are about 4.5 minutes in January as well. So the marketplace itself is getting a lot more healthy and drivers are earning well at the same time, which is exactly what we want. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay, thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from a line of Ron Josey with Citi. Ron Josey : Great, thanks for taking the question. Dara on Delivery, we're constantly talking about or getting questions on the demand side here, just given macro challenges. And, from what we're hearing on growth in January for Delivery and accelerating expected growth, I guess in February-March. You mentioned habitual in the letter, how much do you think of this growth here in Delivery as category adoption, better convenience, et cetera, or Uber specific, as you mentioned, maybe competition isn't as great and things along those lines? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Well, I think that overall in the category, the Delivery category has been pretty resilient post-pandemic, certainly more so than a lot of other categories that that benefit from the pandemic. That said, we are growing faster than the category generally, if you look at us globally. Certainly in Europe, we are seeing many of our competitors pull back significantly from what we're unhealthy spend levels in the past, that didn't make any sense. They may sense in terms of top line, but they certainly didn't make sense in terms of bottom line.  And for us in Delivery, we're benefiting from the power of the platform, very cheap audience, from our Rides business. Remember, we get more new eaters, from our rides app than we do from Google and Facebook and Instagram, combined at about a quarter of a cost. So that is a very significant structural advantage that is assisting our Delivery business. You've got our membership business, that again, is adding higher frequency higher spend more retention as well. We're the only player out there that has membership, both on Mobility with Mobility and Delivery benefits as well. And then you've seen our tech, which is optimization around cost per transaction, and then an ad business that we're building that is starting to scale.  So the combination of all of those four factors, I think, is allowing us to outgrow the category, which generally has been more resilient than other categories as well. And I wouldn't expect anything to change going forward. We do think that we should continue to outgrow the category in Delivery going forward based on the environment that we're seeing. Ron Josey : Thank you, Dara. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Thanks, next question? Operator : Next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni with Jefferies. John Colantuoni : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So Mobility continues to deliver impressive bookings growth. Maybe if you could just help give us a sense for how shared gains are playing into that versus broader recovery in category usage as you have moved further past the pandemic. And assuming you are seeing some share shifts, are you starting to see evidence that the investments you've made in driver supply technology and Uber One are allowing you to leverage your network effect and in driving sort of a permanent competitive advantage that could drive ongoing share shifts in certain markets?  And then second question about freight. Bookings in EBITDA for freight were a bit behind our expectations, but you could just discuss how it compared to your own expectations in the fourth quarter, and some puts and takes of what drove could have driven that delta relative to your own expectations. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, the first thing I'd say, John is that I've never seen a permanent competitive advantage in my life, and we don't expect to. So the advantages that we have in terms of a business and Mobility, we are gaining category position, and we're getting category positions certainly in the U.S. We are in Europe and in the UK, and Australia, et cetera. We're seeing one of our competitors in France, spent a ton of money which doesn't seem to make any sense whatsoever, but they've done it before and we push them back.  And we don't consider spending more money a strategy. It just like that's maybe that's a strategy when the only thing that counted was how much money you could raise. And while we see some of our competitors kind of trapped in the spend more money strategy if you want to call, it we are driving. We're using efficiency we're using technology like upfront fares and destinations, and we're using the power of our platform with membership to win category position the right way. And the right way for us is grow strong top-line faster than the category and leverage a bottom line so that you're profitable, and you continue to increase profit margins as well.  So right now, we are seeing kind of the positive feedback loop of more driver supply leading to more demand, leading to more data so that we can target that demand so that we can match the right driver to the right rider, whether it's reserved or on-demand. That feedback loop is happening. But we are going to have to stay on our toes to continue to gain category position while improving margins. And we don't take a minute of that for granted.  We'll continue to our best the results in the last year, year and a half have been really, really good. And the trends that we're seeing for now are really good. But the minute we take our foot off the gas, is the first minute that a competitor starts to get an advantage over us. So we don't take any of it for granted.  Nelson, if you want to go? Nelson Chai : Sure, regarding the freight. So yes, we're watching the same trends you are. Yes, we wish the freight numbers were better in the fourth quarter. But as you know, there's a little bit of a cyclical nature to what's going on more broadly in the industry. The business continues to do well, and so as we bought the Transplace business in December of 2021. We spent a fair amount of last year integrating the business and Transplace Tupelo business continues to be resilient with everything going on.  And what we've seen as our Uber Freight -- historically Uber Freight business has done a very good job using the brand and our tech, our shared tech to really drive out and build out its presence, particularly with what I'd call national brands, where we need to spend some more time is really focused on some of the small and midsized shippers. And so we're doing that right now. And we've made some organizational tweaks. We do expect that you'll see us getting some traction there, but the overwhelming cycle that's going on right now more broadly on the freight industry is going to continue to impact our business. And so that business will continue to lag likely versus where we would have hoped. And certainly versus a year ago where it was a much different dynamic more broadly in freight business in this country. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Operator, we will take our last question now. Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Nikhil Devnani : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple please. Looks like the leverage on promotional spending has been quite good. I think it's the third quarter in a row of sales and marketing dollars stepping down. How much more efficient can that line get? And as a follow on to that when you think about your ambition, so on gross bookings growth? I mean, do you expect to ramp promotional spending down the road? Or do you feel comfortable about growing the business while continuing to get leverage against that that item? Thank you. Nelson Chai : So I'll start on the first one and Dara can handle the second half of it. So again, we're focused on really delivering and balancing our growth and our efficiency. So that's been our path. And I talked about when we took our big call to action in 2020. So as a company, we've been focused on growth and efficiency.  We recognize that we put out targets last year. And our goal is to make sure we achieve or overachieve against them, which I believe we have, if you think about the last six quarters. And so there are times when we might take some incremental dollars and spend back in a specific marketplace. And that would there'd be strategic reasons why we would do it. There might be some situations where we pull back and so we have a capital allocation framework that we've had now for the past few years. And it's what's working well is what I would say.  And so I don't want to say, could we actually get very, superefficient in the quarter? Maybe. Would we likely not? We still think there's a lot of growth. And so our goal is to really think about as our set kind of where the path's is going and making sure that we are investing behind those growth levers, so we can deliver the kind of top line growth we're doing. And delivering -- over delivering against the bottom line which we have been doing. Dara Khosrowshahi : And Nikhil, in terms of ramping S&M to drive top-line, the way I described our activities is, it's exactly like Nelson said. Generally, we want to leverage all of our cost lines the cost of sales, marketing cost. Certainly, we want to leverage operating costs and make sure that we stay lean as a company, it's just much more fun to win as a small team versus big teams. And that allows us then to lean into different segments of the business that we want to specifically grow, whether that's a specific geo, or that's a specific product. You see us with our Superbowl ad, with Uber One, that's an expensive ad that is leading into Uber One to drive growth in a very, very strategic product of ours.  So strategically overall, our efficiency or drives efficiency, profit business then allows us to strategically invest in various geos or various areas. And yes, that will include investments and marketing. It'll include investments in tech as well so that we can strategically grow where we can build an advantage over our competitors. And as long as we keep on driving this efficiency every single day, every single week, every single month, every single year, that opens up avenues for us to invest and deliver the bottom line that investors are looking for long term. Nikhil Devnani : Appreciate the color. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. I think that's it. Yeah, you bet. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. Huge thank you for the Uber team, delivering another great quarter and big thank you to our earners who without them, none of this would be possible. 2022 was a really, really good year for the company. And we're looking for 2023 to be an even better year. Thank you, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Balaji Krishnamurthy, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Thank you, operator. Thank you for joining us today and welcome to Uber's first quarter 2023 earnings presentation. On the call today we have Uber\u2019s CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi; and CFO, Nelson Chai. During today's call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are included in the press release, supplemental slides, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com.

For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statement, please refer to the press release we issued today, as well as risks and uncertainties described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, and in other filings made with the SEC when available. We published our quarterly earnings press release, prepared remarks, and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website earlier today. And we ask you to review those documents if you haven't already. We will open the call to questions following brief opening remarks from Dara. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Balaji. Uber is off to a strong start in 2023, with gross bookings up 22% year-on-year at constant currency. Trips outpaced gross bookings growth and accelerated to 24% growth from 19% last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of 761 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance, and we delivered incremental adjusted EBITDA margin of 12% and record free cash flow of 549 million. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve consistently delivered results that have exceeded both investor expectations and our own internal plans. Even as we performed well, we're acutely aware that expectations have only continued to increase for scale platforms, blackouts. We're working to accelerate our path to GAAP net income by optimizing our entire P&L every single line item. Despite any macroeconomic uncertainty, I'm more confident than ever in our prospects and remain committed to best-of-breed cash flow growth. The Uber platform has never been stronger, our own expectations have never been higher, and we\u2019re excited to leave no doubt as to the scope of our ambitions for exceptionally profitable growth. With that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks so much for taking the questions. Dara, good EBITDA upside the 549 million in free cash flow and talking about GAAP operating income this year, I think headcount is flat-to-down this year. Do you believe you need to tighten up the cost structure anymore and how do you balance those considerations with product and growth? And then secondly, just in terms of AI, you talked about improvements on ETAs and onboarding, what are some of the other ways you envision AI driving the consumer experience for Uber? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. So, I think as far as the cost structure goes, listen, we manage the cost structure dynamically based on the environment that we're seeing. And I think the results speak for themselves in terms of our bookings growth, [strip] [ph] acceleration on a quarter-on-quarter basis. And then you look at our EBITDA that we delivered well above street expectations, well above our guidance, and the forward EBITDA 800 million to 850 million that we guided to again even at the low-end above what street expectations were. So, we will be managing our cost structure to the opportunities ahead and also with a very strong, kind of dose of discipline. So, even in a market where we're gaining category position, we expect our headcount to be flat to down for the balance of the year, and that is going to be our starting point as we go into next year as well. So, I think you're going to see pretty extraordinary leverage in terms of the top line and bottom line. The incremental EBITDA that we delivered this last quarter was 12%, which is well above the 7% target that we talked about. And if you look at our guidance, the incremental EBITDA that we're talking about for Q2 was about 10%, which remains well above our targets. If the business slows down and we don't expect it to slow down materially, we will adjust and I think Nelson and myself, the rest of the team have a demonstrated the ability to deliver in good markets and bad markets. Remember, this is not a fair weather company. We've been through a lot of difficult things we came out of COVID. So, just the muscles, the P&L muscles were there. And hopefully you'll remember early last year before everyone else was raising alarms about the reality of today's capital markets and discipline needed, we raised the alarms internally and we took action early so that we didn't have to be reactive like a lot of other tech companies had been. So like, we're innovating, we're building, while a bunch of people are restructuring, and I think that's a good position to be in. As far as AI goes, we are looking full stack at AI. I think a lot of people obviously want to talk about the sexy, kind of new consumer applications. I would tell you that I think that the earliest and most significant effect that AI is going to have on our company is going to have to \u2013 is actually going to be as it relates to our developer productivity. Some of the tools that we're seeing in terms of co-pilot are going to allow our devs to, kind of be super-devs and to be able to innovate more, build more faster having co-pilot along with them. And that will essentially leverage and accelerate innovation across the platform. And this is where the platform that I think is innovating faster than anyone else. I think on the cost side, you can see chatbots powering a lot more experiences as opposed to let's say live agents. I think the quality of those chatbot experiences is going to increase with AI with a voice that can be more human, interactions that can be more complex, etcetera.  And then we will look to surprise and delight. Pick me up at the airport. I'm arriving in American flight 260 on Tuesday. And we will know who you are, where your home is, what kind of cars you like, etcetera, and AI can power those kinds of experiences. So, it's going to go from productivity to cost to delight. And we're thrilled. It's like, it's a wonderful ploy that hopefully will return significantly going forward for the company. Doug Anmuth : Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Ross Sandler from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross Sandler : Hey, guys. Congrats. Question on the ride's take rate. So, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that both rider and driver incentives were down pretty nicely in the U.S. and your category position is stable. So is that the primary driver of the improvement in rides take rate? And kind of looking forward, how much more room do you see to kind of continue that trend of reducing incentives, while holding category share? Thanks a lot. Nelson Chai : Yes. So as Dara mentioned, we optimize our marketplace in order to both make sure that we are driving and overachieving against the guidance that we put out on the bottom line. But certainly, we also want to try to allocate and drive growth on the top line as well. And so right now, things are working quite well if you look at both top line, as well as the bottom line growth in the quarter. And so, I would say it's a combination of both. So, we leaned in a lot, as you know last year in terms of bringing drivers back. And so the marketplace is much more healthy from a supply perspective. So, periodically, we will put in some more incentive to continue to drive demand. And again, what I would say is that we work very hard at balancing our marketplace because it's not just delivering the EBITDA and the free cash flow that we're promising, but we are trying to continue to grow the company at scale. And so, you saw that our gross bookings were up 22% on a constant basis and the mobility business even higher. And so, as we go into next year, what's actually exciting about is our trip growth is actually accelerating faster. And again, for us, that's our marketplace working. And so again, you'll see us continue to toggle back between the two and our focal point really is on continuing to drive our company at scale on the top line and overdeliver against our commitments on the bottom. Dara Khosrowshahi : And Ross, just to add one point is, part of the take rate increase that you saw Q4 to Q1 on the mobility business is seasonal. Q4 tends to be very, very busy from a demand perspective. So, we put more money so to speak as incentives to make sure that supply is balanced. Q1 usually demand is a bit lower and supply is elevated. Therefore, we can take down incentives, which has effect of increasing our take rate. If you take a look, if you ignore the merchant model, kind of the accounting adjustments that we had, our take rate kind of Q4 to Q1 went from, call it [21:4 to 21 :1] [ph]. So, there was a slight decrease \u2013 sorry. It was the other way. [Indiscernible]. So there's a slight increase in take rates, but most of that is seasonal. And really, it's as nothing said. We're managing for the entire P&L and take rate is just one element of the P&L. Nelson Chai : Yeah. So, what Dara is referencing is the business model change in the UK that happened last March. And so, you're seeing that overlap, which so that \u2013 that was the \u2013 with our point of that. Ross Sandler : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, appreciate the new, the rider cohort data in the in the slide deck. I'd be curious to hear a little more detail about, which used cases or products are sort of driving this strong new user cohort frequency and spend behavior that you're using that you're seeing? And then the second one on delivery, you're talking about acceleration in the business, really healthy. Can you just talk to us about which products or regions are driving that acceleration? And how we should think about that over the course of the year? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, Brian. In terms of the mobility cohorts, which are positive, kind of on a year-on-year basis and then the newer cohorts are actually even more healthy in terms of trip frequency. It comes really from the amalgamation of all of the work that we are doing on the platform. Supplies is strong, ETAs are coming down, surge came down from Q4 to Q1 and that's resulting in higher conversion rates in terms of how many sessions does a does a rider have and do they convert on that on that session. So, the quality of the marketplace is clearly having effect, but at the same time, we're innovating and we're adding a ton of new products and choices for the router as well. Reserve is an example. I talked about 20% now of our airport drop-off being reserve trips. And what we're finding is that, Reserve has a combination of riders who used to use our on-demand marketplace, now using Reserve to make sure that they're, kind of guaranteed availability or guaranteed a much higher reliability. But it's also bringing new riders into the system as well that are, you know, it's a use case travel is a strong used case with high average fares as well. So, I think it's a combination of marketplace health and innovation around new used cases that is driving the frequency that we are seeing. In terms of delivery, as far as the growth there and the acceleration drivers, one is just that we had Omicron comps earlier in the year. So, if you look at January, delivery volumes were a bit lighter just because of comps, and then we saw acceleration going into February and March and we expect strong growth for the balance of the year. And the other factor in terms of delivery is again the customer cohort data is actually quite healthy. Earner [eater retention] [ph] has improved significantly. So eaters are staying with the platform. Frequency is up and a higher percentage of our eaters and riders, but especially eaters are members. And as you know, members spend 4x than the non-members do. So, all of that is adding up to continued healthy growth for the platform, both in on the mobility side and on the Eats side as well. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Maybe following up on that with two on the delivery side of the equation. Dara, you called out in the letter improving your category position in large markets, can you give us a little bit better sense of what you see as the key investments to improve category position are? And how investors should think about the growth output or the yield from those investments looking out over the medium to long-term? And then second with respect to the delivery business, how should we think about market share dynamics broadly in the delivery business versus where you see yourself as the best positioned to compete where there's an overlap between the Uber One subscription and the mobility business where that might put you on a competitive footing that's different then markets where that may not be as prevalent? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. So, I think on the delivery side, we're seeing the result of a couple of factors. First of all, we've got the power of the platform in that we have our mobility business that is actively upselling our mobility customers to our each products. The audience that we have on the mobility business is the largest audience in the world in terms of any of our mobility competitors. And we're the only players who \u2013 scale players who are, kind of upselling from mobility to delivery and then vice-versa. So, against our competitors who are model on competitors, who are delivering only competitors, we have a source of low cost traffic, significantly low cost traffic. Our mobility business sends us more customers than we get from Facebook and Google and Snap and all of these different platforms combined. And that's just a structural advantage that we have against the overall market certainly against our competitors. And then I think we are executing particularly well algorithmically as it relates to improving our marketplace efficiency on the delivery side. Higher percentage of batching orders and using deep learning technique to drive down cost per transaction on the delivery side. You add on top of that our advertising product, which continues to grow at high rates, advertisers are up 70% year-on-year using our platform. And you get some pretty powerful economic drivers that's allowing us deliver the kinds of bottom line that you saw on our delivery business, which is well ahead of estimates while gaining category position in 9 of our top 10 markets on a global basis. So, I think that it's, you know, it's happening broadly. It's not 5 out of 10, it's 9 out of 10 markets where we're gaining category position. And I do think it's the power of the platform. And again, we see it in almost every single market out there. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thanks. Nelson, maybe just give us an update on the EBITDA progress if you take [850x 4] [ph], you're already over 3 billion run rate. What are the drivers to get over 5 billion here? Is it network efficiencies, marketing spend, leverage on personnel, how are you thinking about the growth from here? And then I noticed you had some interesting comments on the taxi business, just a high level, how much that's helping your mobility growth? Thank you. Nelson Chai : Okay. So, I'll handle the first half of it. So again, when we put out the targets last year, our expectation was to at least achieve them on the top line, but over deliver on the bottom. And we're five quarters into putting out a 12-month plan. And I think history shows that we've overachieved every quarter and we intend to continue to do so. So again, if you if you take the Q2 trajectory, which is actually what you're referencing, we don't stop there. Right?  So, we're continuing to invest, actually, in our marketplace and continue to grow the marketplace. And we actually are optimizing every single line of the P&L, and we're seeing those benefits. And so, last year we talked a lot about the cost per trip benefits we're getting on delivery. This year, you heard us talk a little bit about our RNA and some of the benefits we can have there. And these are big dollars. And so, the platform really is operating quite well. And so, like, what we're doing is, we work with our teams and work with our product, our tech folks to make sure we're just optimizing the platform. So, to be able to grow 22% constant currency at our scale year-over-year, it's hard, right? It's tremendous what we're doing here and be able to deliver the incremental. So, I think what you should think through is more about where we think we're going to end up next year, understanding that we think we'll continue to outpace on the bottom line. And you heard the commentary about we think we were 12% incremental margins in Q1. Right now if you look at the midpoint of the guidance, it's 10%. So, our expectation is that we'll continue to do better and importantly generate a lot of free cash flow that we think is going to ramp in the coming quarters. So, while we're not touching upon new guidance for 2024 or the out years, hopefully, we're building track record to show you that, you know, the company is really operating at high level right now. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then as it relates to the Taxi market, we don't disclose let's say, Taxi bookings. When we look at Hailables, which is Taxi 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers in certain markets, that's the business that's already over a billion dollars, but really the way that we look at our portfolio is a set of growth bets that we're making.  These are taxi, 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, low-cost, our UberX share, high-capacity vehicles that we're investing in, our Uber for business, Uber for health and then newer products like reserve that are creating entirely kind of new instances for our riders to use a service. If you add up all those growth bets, we're about a $6 billion run rate growing at 100% year-on-year. So, we talked about when we put together a growth platform, we talked about 50% of our growth coming from our base business, 35% of our growth coming from new beds, 15% growth coming from certain international expansion. It's the traditional Uber business, but with its list. And if you look at our growth bets, our growth bets were about 10% of our volume in Q1, say about 20% of our growth in Q1, and they also account for 20% of new riders coming on to the platform. So, not only are they a big part of our growth and kind of a new business segment that we're building while we're introducing an entirely new audience to the Uber platform and those new riders tend to use other products. They'll come [indiscernible]. They'll use this mainline coming on low cost and then both treat themselves to an UberX or comfort as well. So, we see Taxi as a part of a portfolio. Nelson and his team are constantly allocating capital to the base business to the growth bets as well in a dynamic way to deliver the kinds of top lines and then excellent bottom lines that you're seeing. Nelson Chai : So think about our GBs are up 22% on a constant basis just to go back to that. And our EBITDA is up 4x year-over-year. And so again, I think that we really are pulling all the levers to make sure we deliver top and bottom line growth. And so again, I think we're both very confident that we'll continue to do that in the coming quarters. Justin Post : Great. Thanks Nelson and thanks Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thank you. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks a lot. Two, if I can. First, just kind of continuing on the last question. I appreciate the color on Hailables and the new formats. I guess on that international side of the medium-term growth what is the update \u2013 the latest update on some of the markets you flagged at the Analyst Day, like South Korea, Spain, and Germany. And then second one, following up on some of the earlier delivery questions, like \u2013 how much do you think of the benefit you guys are seeing in terms of market share as a function of product improvements versus maybe more discipline across the competitive landscape, just with the rising cost of capital you flagged, I think, Japan in particular. But like anything \u2013 do you feel like those are also part of the benefit and like where are we in seeing the benefit of just a more rational competitive landscape? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. I'll start. In terms of the international markets, a couple that I would call out are Spain, Germany, and Turkey. Spain is a highly regulated market. So, we're having a ton of success in terms of adding supply into our marketplace. Earnings are strong, demand is strong, and Spain is growing at a very significant rate. And we believe we're gaining category position in Spain. Same with Germany. It's a market that we started on probably around four years ago, and then it's developed very well. We're playing by the rules. And Germany is the largest GDP in Europe. So, it's a very, very large market to go after. And we're seeing promise both on the mobility side and the delivery side in Germany. We're happy with that development. A couple of other markets are Turkey, where Turkey is the taxi market, and our innovating around Hailables and building a Taxi products has allowed us to penetrate into that market as well. And then Argentina as well, showing real promise in South America. We're seeing with South Korea and Japan, the market development there is slower than we'd like, frankly, and it's partially because of regulatory issues as it relates to dynamic pricing, et cetera. We're not really \u2013 we're not able to kind of flex all of the muscles of the marketplace of what makes Uber great, especially on the pricing side. We think pricing reform there will benefit drivers. So, we think it's absolutely something that will help out the market, but it's taking a little more time than we would like. And then Nelson, do you want to talk about the second? Nelson Chai : Yes. So on the delivery, so yes, you're partially correct. I think the rationalization of the marketplace is driven by the higher cost of capital. As you know, we've led in terms of trying to drive companies towards profitability. And frankly, for me, companies need to make free cash flow. And so we've led from the front on that. And certainly, everybody has had to follow given where the market is right now. And so we are seeing the benefit of having a bigger and, frankly, a more efficient platform. And it's allowing us to really make progress in certain marketplaces like most of Asia and particularly the U.K. are big call outs in the first quarter. And importantly, what's important now is that right now, if you look at our top 20 delivery markets, so overall on delivery, we're generating 2% EBITDA margin. We're profitable in 15 of our top 20 and actually 6 of our top 20 markets today in the first quarter already above our long-term targets. So, we're growing our market \u2013 our category position. We're gaining. We're growing at the top line, and we're delivering on the bottom line. I think that's just a good formula. But certainly, the overall cost of capital increases and what's going on in the broader role has helped when you have the broadest and the most efficient platform and one where we have the benefit of going across platform. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay. Thank you guys. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thank you. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney from Evercore. Please go ahead your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. I wanted to ask about two questions on the advertising side, what traction you're seeing for advertising on the mobility side? And then in terms of the Uber One program in the prepared comments, you talked about seeing really nice traction, record high levels in North America. Could you talk about in the rest of the world? And also, kind of the what \u2013 if there are product development areas you want to lean into to make the Uber One program even more attractive? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. So, we are very happy overall with our ad products. We talked about the number of advertisers who are using our products, growing 70% to 345,000 businesses. And the majority of our revenue is, to be clear, is on Uber Eats. And it's obviously a big growing platform along with the new products that we're launching all the new vertical ads with sponsored items in the U.S. that are donator CPG advertisers. We continue to see strong momentum on the mobility side with Journey Ads. And these Journey Ads are getting us premium CPMs because if you think about the Uber rider, this is a very high demographic provider. They tend to be younger. So, obviously more open to first-rate brands and advertising. They tend to be mobile. They tend to be urban and they go places. They are moving and they are spending. So, we are seeing very high CPMs as it relates to our mobility advertisers. One of the newer products that we're quite excited about are car tops that you see in certain cities like New York City, and also tablets that we're launching in certain cities as well. These are newer formats. And what's exciting about these new formats is that they are a way for us to improve driver earnings. So for example, with car top \u2013 the driver who has a car top, will make an average of $100 extra a week as it relates to those earnings. So, if drivers are making more money, retention is higher, supply hours are higher. And they're happier and making more, which helps out the marketplace. So we're quite optimistic about our prospects there. As it relates to Uber One, I'd say strength across the board. We are the goal of Uber One is really we are giving a discount to our best customers in order to drive frequency. And we continue to see Uber One members spend 4x more than non-members. Retention is 15% higher than nonmembers as well, and Uber One continues to be a higher and higher percentage of our bookings. It's about 27% now, and we have a target of driving that to 50% plus. And in certain markets outside of the U.S., Uber One penetration is significantly higher than that 50% target. So, that's not a theoretical target. That's a target that is absolutely achievable. And I will also add that Uber One members are profitable. And what we find is it's a very, very effective way essentially to drive frequency and higher engagement with our customer base. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you. A \u2013 Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Dara, your competitor in the U.S. is going through a transition currently. How do you think about the potential impact of this on the U.S. rideshare market? And philosophically, what is Uber's priority between, kind of defending category position and profitability if, for some reason, competition intensifies in the space? And then a second question maybe for Nelson. You noted in response to a prior question that you intend to outperform on EBITDA, certainly, the incremental margins have been great. But I wanted to ask if there was any update on your thinking on top line bookings for 2024 since you provided the guidance at the Analyst Day, FX has been a headwind and some markets are in different trajectory. I wanted to ask if you have any updated thoughts on 2024 top line growth? Thank you so much. Nelson Chai : So I'll go first and Dara can answer the competitive question second. So certainly, if you think about what we did in the first quarter, right, 22% constant currency and even 19% reported across our business is extremely strong, especially given some of the headwinds on freight. And if you just think about what we're doing in terms of the forecast in Q2. So, we expect our core mobility and delivery businesses growth bookings to grow 18% to 22%, depending on where you are on the guidance on a constant currency basis. So as we said, we are committed and we are able because we have been so efficient in terms of operating the business and getting the leverage, and we've been mindful about our costs to be able to invest back in some of the products that you've heard Dara talked about already today. And so, we are seeing some of that meaningful benefit as we think about going into 2024. And so again, we are trying to do both which is continue to invest in products that we think will enable us to deliver against the top line. But importantly, we expect to continue to do what we've been doing, which is over deliver against the bottom and generate a very, very strong free cash flow in the coming quarters. And so again, I would just say that we spend a lot of time on capital allocation inside the company. And right now, the formula is working quite well because we're able to do both as well as, again, invest in new geographies and invest in new products. And I think you should just expect that to continue. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. And Deepak, as far as the trade-off between CP and profitability, the first thing I would say is, I hope that we have demonstrated over the past 6, 7 quarters that that's a false trade-off. We've been consistently gaining category position. And as you've seen, we've been delivering on profitability at a rate well in excess of our internal targets and in excess of external expectations, right, 12% this last quarter. And again, delivering essentially record adjusted EBITDA of 288 million in adjusted EBITDA, over 20% incremental margins while gaining category position in 9 out of our 10 markets. And it's a combination of the team executing really well are being the scale player, are being the global player and having the power of the platform that our competitors don't. As far as what we are seeing domestically with Lyft, obviously, they're going through a lot of changes. It's a very, very strong brand. It's not going anywhere. And what we're seeing is, they're looking to price competitively with us. And we think that sets up a competitive environment where we're competing on brand and we're competing on service and ETAs and accuracy, reliability, et cetera. So, we think it sets up a constructive competitive environment going forward. We haven't seen any signal otherwise. But I think you'll have to ask them that question when they report their earnings as far as what their strategy is going forward. But so far, what we see is constructive, and we don't see any reason why it would change. I do think a more disciplined marketplace. I think the market has said very, very clearly that the days of paying for share and essentially using shareholder money to buy share temporarily. Those days are over. And so, we think the overall competitive environment for tech generally, but especially in our market is going to be constructive going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from John Colantuoni from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. John Colantuoni : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to look at the U.S. and Canada cohort figures again. I'm curious why frequency among the pre-COVID cohorts in 2022 was lower than the newer cohorts? Is there something about demographics or adoption of reserve for the newer cohorts or something else that's causing the higher frequency. And mainly, I'm curious if there's an opportunity to improve adoption of Reserve or Uber One in the older cohorts. And then second question \u2013 sorry. Go ahead. Dara Khosrowshahi : No, go ahead. Go ahead. Ask your second question. John Colantuoni : Yes. Just quickly on freight. Freight has been falling short on expectations from industry headwinds. Can you just, sort of update us on how you envision performance of that business trending throughout the year? And when you think about ROIC and capital allocation to build that business relative to your core mobility and delivery businesses, are you looking for opportunities to pare back a bit or even to look for strategic opportunities to monetize that business to help accelerate your path to GAAP profitability and investment grade? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. So, I think on the first one, Nelson will take the second one. In terms of frequency of cohorts, we think it's exactly what you talked about, which is it's a product set. If you look at our product set today versus 2019, the breadth of product that we have available to our mobility riders is significantly higher than it was, whether it's reserve or reimagined x share, et cetera, there are just more opportunities for someone to use our product. And that's resulting in higher frequency, kind of on a year-on-year basis. But if you look at each cohort, the 2021 cohort, their frequency increases, as well as we have healthy pricing, healthy availability, and then newer products available for them. Also remember that our membership program, we think over a period of time, it's just mathematically going to drive higher frequency across the business, it will have a higher impact because the incrementality generally is higher for delivery than mobility, but it should also show up in mobility as well.  So, these are very, very strong, as you know, kind of frequency numbers. They're only getting better. And we think as we continue to innovate around new products, we should be able to have industry-leading frequency, especially since we are able to bring in users on a rise platform or each platform and cross-sell them in a way that no one else can. Nelson, do you want to talk freight? Nelson Chai : Sure. So, first of all on Freight, from a macro perspective, this is \u2013 we are at a macro low in terms of the cycle. And so what happened was a lot of supply entered the market broadly. And a lot of the supply chain challenges that came during COVID have arrested. So, right now, you're seeing a very oversupplied market. So that really impacts rates. And it really impacts a combination of spot versus contract rates. And so that's actually going on globally. And you probably will see that as you think about other freight carriers and certainly in the brokerage space. In terms of its impact, as we think about the guidance that we put out as we think about getting towards GAAP operating profit, those are all taken into account into the guidance we make into the statements we've made. And so, while we think about from a capital allocation perspective, it is important to note that we raised excess external capital to fund free and we actually funded separately. And in fact, even the employees of freight are getting freight equity as well. And so, there's a separate board that manages it as well. So, freight really is something that we still believe in. The team continues to make progress in terms of digitizing a very analog business. We are in a very challenging part of the cycle. And again, we have a lot of optionality around it. But again, the team does make progress, and [Leo and team] [ph] are making very good progress in terms of some of the applications there. But again, we're in a tough part of the cycle and it has no impact, if you will, or minimal impact as we think about the guidance that we give at the corporate perspective in terms of generating both GAAP operating profit, as well as free cash flow. Dara Khosrowshahi : I think just one other note going back to frequency to add. One of the reasons why we're quite optimistic about our frequency on the mobility side is, if you look at the 2019 cohort, actually Uber pool, which was a high frequency, but extremely low-margin product, negative margin product for us was a much more significant part of the portfolio than UberX shares now. We are now launching Uber share within the right way with economics that work. We are aligning incentives between the rider and the driver and ourselves in terms of pricing as well. So, as we expand UberX share as consumers experience it, and we're seeing strong signal there. We think that could be an additional tailwind for frequency going forward in addition to general experience and the membership program. Next question. Operator : Our last question will come from Ron Josey from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit more about Uber One, just given it now accounts for 27% of gross bookings. Talk to us at a little bit more about the programs just to drive continued adoption of Uber One. And then in the letter, as it relates to delivery, there was talk about investments around grocery, convenience, just newer verticals within delivery, would love to hear the progress there as well. Thank you very much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely, Ron. So, in terms of our Uber One program, while adoption of Uber One is incredibly important, we're actually more focused on retention. Any time that you build the membership program, it's easy to get, call it, initial numbers up. But if your retention statistics are not where kind of we want them to be, then at some point, you're going to hit a wall. So, actually, if you look at the team and what their priorities are, it's very much on retention, making sure that the experience of an Uber One member is first rate. If they get a delivery that's late, kind of we make it up for them. Making sure that even details like payments or renewals, payment failure rates are minimized, et cetera. All of this work that is, kind of gritty work, kind of behind the scenes is actually our priority in making sure that we improve retention rates for our membership program if we improve retention rates, and we're quite confident that trends are definitely moving in the right direction, then you'll see overall membership continue to increase. And obviously, higher retention means half year members as well. So, that really is the focus of the group. And it's definitely showing them that the increased penetration as it relates to our overall gross bookings, you will see more experiential benefits of the Uber One. Right now, it's all about discount and discounts are awesome and a much higher percentage of our members just logically should be using the program because they will save a ton of money. But also, we will look for experiential benefits like a priority dispatch during certain periods to introduce into the program as well. Those are unique benefits that we can offer that really no one else can offer. As far as new verticals, we're very, very optimistic on our progress there. We're now at \u2013 in excess of a $5 billion annualized gross bookings run rate. The business is growing 30% year-on-year. And really, it's a disciplined investment path into the category. What we're most excited about is the product itself. We are introducing the native grocer experience to a much larger audience across the company. And as we have done that, we have seen the percentage of Uber Eats customers who then order from new verticals increased nicely. It's about up 300 basis points year-on-year, in terms of the percentage of each customers who use new verticals. And then it's all about selection.  It's about launching new retail partners, selection of like partners like Kohl's in Australia. They're the second largest grocer. As we add selection as experience continues to improve. Those ease customers who use new verticals are going to be happy and they're going to come back. So, the trend here is positive, but we have a very long way to go.  Our ambition for new vertical are multiples of the $5 billion that we're at now, but it is going to take disciplined growth to get there. And I think by the results that you've seen you have seen us able to invest in new products, like new verticals, but at the same time, deliver substantial increases in margins at the same time. And I think it will be more of the same going forward if we do our jobs. Balaji Krishnamurthy : Let's wrap it up there. Thank you, everyone, for joining. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thank you very much for joining, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Alax Wang, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Alax Wang : Thank you, Sarah. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber's second quarter 2023 earnings presentation. On the call today, we have Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, and CFO, Nelson Chai. During today's call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are included in the press release, supplemental slides, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com. As a reminder, these numbers are unaudited and may be subject to change. Certain statements in this presentation and on this call are forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements we make today except as required by law. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today as well as risks and uncertainties described in our most recent Form 10-K and in other filings made with the SEC. We published our quarterly earnings press release, prepared remarks, and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website earlier today, and we ask you to review those documents if you haven't already. We will open the call to questions following brief opening remarks from Dara. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Alax. For most of our history, profitable wasn't the first thing that came up when you asked someone about Uber. In fact, many observers over the years boldly claimed that we would never make any money. And I understood why they felt that way; the easy availability of capital over the past decade obscured the pure -- the poor unit economics of many businesses. But we knew they were wrong about Uber as did many of our investors who backed us over the years. We reached two important milestones this quarter, which demonstrates the significant transformation we've undergone towards profitable growth : our first-ever GAAP operating profit of $326 million, and our first quarter of free cash flow over $1 billion, all the while delivering record platform engagement, strong top-line growth and a new all-time high of $15.1 billion in total earnings for drivers and couriers on the platform. As we've said before, when it comes to fulfilling our mission and building a generational company, profitability is a means and not merely an end. There are very few businesses that can deliver both strong growth at our scale and continue to expand margins. We remain focused on scaling GAAP operating income and free cash flow, while also making disciplined investments to appropriately fund growth initiatives that will carry us into the future. I also want to take a moment to thank Nelson, who we announced will be leaving Uber on January 5 after overseeing a smooth transition as we search for a new finance leader. Nelson has been a huge part of Uber's transformation over the past five years, taking us public, gearing the company to profitability through unprecedented times, establishing credibility and trust with our investor base, and building a phenomenal team along the way. Nelson has been a trusted advisor for me personally, and I know that I speak for the entire company that we're grateful for everything he's done to establish such a strong foundation for our path forward and that we'll sorely miss hearing Nelson unplugged during our all-hands meetings. With that, let's open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one just on multi-year Mobility bookings growth. Dara, can you just sort of talk us through how we should be thinking through the key drivers of driving single-digit versus double-digit multi-year ride bookings? Is it users? Is it frequency? Is it pricing? How -- what is sort of the [math or the] (ph) schematic that we should be thinking through to sort of keep that growing double digits? And then, the second one, throughout the quarter, I know you did some interviews and podcasts around improving matching and conversion of the network. I'd be curious to hear about how you're using large language models now to better analyze the network? And how do you think about the potential to use them going forward, even drive higher matching across the overall network? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, absolutely. Great questions, Brian. So, in terms of Mobility growth and the formula there, I'd say -- listen, it comes down to the basics, which is it comes to audience frequency and price. And our audience -- our overall MAPC growth has been 12% on a year-on-year basis for the platform, with Mobility, it's actually even stronger than that. And our frequency has consistently increased in terms of transactions per MAPC, 9% year-on-year. And if you think about audience and frequency, we think that we should be able to grow audience at strong either high-single digits, low-double digits, as we introduce a host of new products out there and as we continue to expand internationally as well, and frequency continues to increase and it's not quite at all-time highs even at this point in terms of 5.6 uses per month. And if you look at certain markets like Brazil in Mobility alone, the frequency is over 7 times a month. So, we think we've got many, many years of increasing frequency. Again, as we add more products into the service and generally the world goes more on demand. And then, on top of that, you add inflation or pricing growth, call it, normalized pricing growth as well, we think it -- we have a base business that can grow in the double digits. Again, audience, even if you say single-digits, frequency, single-digits plus, price in the single digits, you get to a double-digit growth rate for the base business. Then, on top of the base business, we have a number of new products out there. This is adding taxis, this is adding 2-wheelers, 3-wheelers, Uber Reserve, our enterprise product, Uber for Business and Uber for Health, for example, low-cost product when you look at UberX Share or high capacity vehicles. That whole portfolio today is at $8 billion gross bookings run rate. It's growing over 80% on a year-on-year basis. We said that going forward that would account for about 35% of our growth and certainly it's growing a lot faster than the base business. And then, on top of that, you have a number of international markets that historically we haven't been in or where we've got to shift their model, our traditional P2P model to different kinds of models, whether they're licensed models, taxi models, et cetera. This is Germany or Spain or Japan or Korea or Turkey, Argentina, a host of other countries out there. That pool of bookings is about $3 billion. It's growing well over 100%. So, when you add all that together, which is a base business where we're driving audience frequency, you get some pricing; you've got a portfolio of growth bets that are $8 billion, growing over 100%; and then you got a portfolio of international territory countries that we're going into and continue to expand into, and some big ones like Germany, you get to, I think, a growth formula that is in the solid double-digits. And then combine that with the cost discipline that we've shown, we think that we can get very strong EBITDA growth for the foreseeable future in our Mobility business. The second question in terms of large language models and matching, et cetera, so there are many different kinds of artificial intelligence, machine learning, et cetera out there. The large language models are more focused on text and pictures, et cetera, kind of guessing what the next appropriate answer is. So, they're not as extensible at this point into problems like pricing, matching, routing. Now those are platforms where we have been using machine learning, deep learning models, for years and years and years. This is over the past 10 years. And as compute increases, as the amount of data that we have on the platform increases, as we combine our data pool, Mobility, Delivery data pool, and the availability of couriers and drivers all in a single pool to be able to dispatch them to different jobs, whether it's a job of driving someone or going shopping for someone or delivering food, we just think we have the greatest amount of data out there, the greatest possible number of combinations out there, and I think the best team in the world in terms of our marketplace capabilities and our ability to continue to innovate on these machine learning models, and it shows in our marketplace throughput. Our ETAs are stronger than our competitors. Our pricing optimizes more efficiently in terms of total marketplace throughput. And as a result, we're able to grow our Mobility business while delivering significant value to our drivers as well, and it shows in the end in our category position where we gain category position in eight out of our top 10 market. So, we're very confident of the top-line growth and the more data there is out there with the capabilities that we built in-house, the happier we are, so to speak. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Maybe one on Delivery and one on AV partnership. For Delivery, you're in the low double-digit growth. Obviously, non-restaurant is helping a lot there. But can you talk about the state of the restaurant market? Is the reopening hurting growth rates? Do you expect acceleration from here? And how do you think about penetration in that market? And then second, maybe give us some details on the partnership with Waymo? How you're thinking about AVs as far as costs long-term and maybe opening up the market to more riders versus potential competition from other companies? Thanks a lot. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. So, when we look at the Delivery business, we're actually quite pleased with the trends there. Last quarter, we grew at about 12% constant currency, that accelerated to 14% constant currency. This quarter, certainly New Verticals was a help. But we continue to drive higher frequency as a higher percentage of our bookings come from our members, as we improve the service, as we improve the average delivery times to our consumer as well, and generally basket sizes are positive there. So again, you break down the growth in terms of audience, frequency and price, and all of those are positive factors in terms of our Delivery business. And going forward, we expect growth consistent with what we saw this quarter or accelerating even from this quarter as well, depending on the marketplace, the competitive position and how things shake out. But generally, we're quite confident of Delivery top-line growth going forward. And we think the penetration in these markets is very low. So, in many of our developed markets there, significant markets there, we've wired up anywhere from 20% of restaurants to, call it, 40% of restaurants in a particular market. So, if you think about just all of the inventory out there, these restaurants are in the marketplace. They've got loyal clients. They're servicing their local communities. And we think as we wire them up, then naturally more people want delivery, because it's another way of staying connected, it's another way of getting great food whenever you want on a on-demand basis. So, we think that with the very early penetration into the total restaurant in our major markets being, call it, a range of 20% to 40%, we've got a long, long runway ahead of us. In terms of AVs, it's very, very early, and we are quite excited about the partnership with Waymo. We think they are best-of-breed in terms of their technical capabilities and their ambition to build in this business. It really is too soon to tell at this point what the economics are going to look like. We're quite focused on building out the product and really working with Waymo and our other autonomous partners, because we do think we'll have a -- we're developing a portfolio partners out there to have essentially a routing layer between when demand comes into the network to be able to determine on a real-time basis whether or not we should route that demand to a person or to one of our autonomous partners, including Waymo or others, Aurora in trucking, for example. We have many delivery partners out there. That dynamic routing system should allow us to deliver a great service for the eater or the rider or the shipper, and at the same time, shift demand towards the autonomous player, but it's demand that they can serve as well. The pickup is really close to you, the drop off is really close to you, the O&D fit, the capabilities that you built out. So, we're at the very, very early stages of building that technology, and we think we'll continue to build on our partnerships, whether it's Waymo or [Serve] (ph) or Aurora or Motional or Nuro or Volvo or Cartken. There are many, many players out there, and we really want to build and support a large autonomous ecosystem. Justin Post : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Next question? You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks. One on Uber One. And could you talk about the kind of product innovations that you're currently working on? Are you thinking about for next year or two to take that adoption of that to a higher level? I know you're rolling it out into more international markets. Can you talk about maybe is there a lead market where the Uber One in North America where the Uber One penetration is of users, so we could think about where that could go globally? And then briefly, on the Mobility revenue take rate, it looks like it was a record high 29.3%. Is that sustainable? Is that -- was there a reason to think that, that just kind of continues to move higher because of operational efficiencies? Thank you very much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Nelson, do you want to take take rate first, then I'll... Nelson Chai : Yes. So, first of all, Mark, you have -- if you -- the reported take rate was 29.3%. But if you adjust for the U.K. merchant model change, which happened a year ago, the underlying take rate was actually 21.1%. It's actually down versus Q1. So, on the underlying basis, the take rate decreased by 30 basis points, if you actually boil through it all. And it's largely because we made some supply investments in some international markets, particularly LatAm and APAC. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then, as far as Uber One goes, I'd say one area that we're quite excited about in addition to now expanding into 15 markets is the introduction of Uber Cash for our Mobility business. We think that Uber Cash is a better product for the consumer. One, the discount that we offer is higher because it creates more incrementality for the consumer out there, but it also allows the consumer to essentially earn cash on rides, but then spend it across the platform. They can spend that cash on Mobility, Delivery. If they earn on a business trip, for example, they can spend the money on a personal trip, which is pretty cool. So, it's a very, very flexible way of spending, and we think it's a win-win. It's a win for the consumer because they could spend across the platform versus apply their discount just to, let's say, that Mobility trip, and it's a win for Uber because what we observe is that it drives increased incrementality as far as a membership benefit goes. Some of the other areas in which we're working on membership is creating more benefits that aren't just, let's say, discounts in nature to create, for example, an upgrade into a Comfort or an upgrade into a Black or advantaged pickup in airports. So, we think experiential benefits can really lock in that membership as well. And then, we're also working on some technical capabilities, for example, upselling members from a monthly membership to annual memberships that drive long-term retention. They don't necessarily drive the number of members or the, let's say, gross bookings penetration near term, but long-term they set up the membership platform to create longer retention, so to speak, over the platform. Right now, membership is in the high 20%-s as far as gross bookings penetration across the platform, and Delivery, it's in the mid-30%s. But in Taiwan, for example, members account for significantly higher than 50% of our gross bookings. So that's really our aim. Our aim across the company on a global basis is getting to that 50% level. We are far from it. But we know that it can be done because we're doing it today in Taiwan, and it's really about continuing to expand globally and drive penetration across our user base. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Dara. Thank you, Nelson. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're very welcome. Nelson Chai : Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ross Sandler : Hey, guys. On the topic of improving profitability, the incremental margin for Mobility continues to look pretty solid. As we look ahead towards Uber getting closer to that double-digit EBITDA margin target, what are the main drivers from here? Is that a function of just bringing the markets that are still a little bit below average closer to that average? Is it wearing in some of these new services? Any additional color on that would be helpful. And then, second question is on -- around new travel options. So, in the U.K., you guys have recently added the ability to book train and bus tickets and a few other things. What's the early learnings from these efforts? And how do you view the longer-term opportunity around some of these new things outside of the core Mobility and Delivery business? Thanks. Nelson Chai : So, Ross, I'll take the first one on Mobility profitability. And so, as you know, we continue to march up the margin expansion, and we have over the previous quarters. We'll continue to do it. It may not be a straight line march, it will continue -- because there are sometimes where we'll make offensive investments in some either new products or new geographies. There're also going to be quarters where if you think about our profitability margin, we might invest a little bit more in drivers, but sometimes insurance pops up as well as some other consumer incentives. But as you know, we are committed to continuing to march the Mobility profile up. It's really simple in terms of we are really levering our fixed cost base. As you know, we're really focused hard on both containing our fixed cost, getting leverage on all the variable cost items, including insurance. And then, what we're doing is we are seeing some adoption of some really good new products like Reserve in some of these other areas. And so, that -- what that really results in is margin expansion. And so -- and you should expect that the company will continue to maintain that kind of cost discipline margin expansion. Yes, there will be some markets where we have to continue to build on the expansions, particularly in some of the big growth markets like Germany and some other markets out there, but you should expect over time that those margins will continue to march-up like they have been over the past period of time. Dara Khosrowshahi : And if you look at our efforts in the U.K., it's really borne out of two different trends that we observed. One is that generally, we just want to wire up every single vehicle in the world that's available to move people or things around. And you saw our efforts in terms of transit, for example, buses and subways and/or taxis that we used to compete with. Now, we think we can -- we should have every single taxi on Earth on the platform. So, that was one trend that we have been focused on, not just in the U.K., but around the world. Second was, this, to some extent, is from my previous experiences, you look at tour operators in the U.K. that are providing, for example, coach transport to airports, et cetera. Travel is a very important ecosystem for us, both in terms of pickups and drop-offs, and we have a very significant audience of international travelers and U.K. travelers. And we said, \"Hey, why can't we go after this tour operator market?\" And essentially, we are building up services that we think rival traditional tour operators with what I will call the Uber Delight. We already know who you are. We know your identity. We know your payments. Tony West, the General Counsel, was saying last week, he was in the U.K., and he booked the Eurostar ticket beautifully effortlessly on the app. And frankly, early on in our experimentation with travel and the tour operator market, we're a little worried that with these additional products on the app distract the user from the mainline use case from I'm going to get from point A to B, I want to go to [indiscernible], et cetera, just get me there. And what we're seeing more recently is that with the power of machine learning, we can offer the right product to the consumer at the right time. So, when we know it's your morning commute on a Tuesday morning, we don't offer you the Eurostar, but when we think that you might be open to new and different ways of using the Uber, and we want to be your kind of the operating system for everyday life, not just for you to go to work, but to be that travel companion as well, we will extend those services, offer those services. We've now expanded into flights as well. And we're actually seeing engagement with users being higher than we thought, and we're not seeing cannibalization of the base business. So, we're quite hopeful of that business. And again, that tour operator market in the U.K. is a very, very large market that we can go after. Early signal is positive. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about the expansion of upfront fares and upfront destination, and just the improvements that you're seeing for both drivers and riders at this point? And then, also, where you are in fully rolling out the new shared rides experience for UberX Share, in particular? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Absolutely. So, in terms of upfront fares, it's a process in terms of expansion, and we're very, very happy generally with our direction there. The most important factor is getting the upfront destination for the drivers so that they know they have all the information that they need in order to accept that trip or not accept that trip. It's driving cancellations, driver cancellations, which are, I think, the single worst experience for a rider when you ask for an Uber, the driver accepts. You've been waiting for four minutes or five minutes, and then the driver cancels, that's a very, very negative experience, because you have to start the cycle all over again. Cancels are down significantly because, again, the drivers who accept your trip accept it knowing much, much more. So from that standpoint, we see upfront prices as being a significant positive for the consumer experience. There are still things that we have to figure out. So, for example, the upfront price and why we're offering a particular upfront price to a driver is something that we still have to work on. Whether -- sometimes we will provide a higher upfront price if the driver has a long pickup time, so has to drive for 10 minutes for a pickup, instead of two minutes for a pickup. We work that into the upfront price, but I don't feel like we're transparent enough in communicating that to the driver. We also have opportunities to improve our pricing in upfront pricing. So, for example, if you take a trip to a place where the suburbs where you're less likely to have a ride back or you're more likely to deadhead back, to work that into the upfront price in an algorithmic way. So we're getting a lot of visibility into driver acceptance rate or non-acceptance rate, and we are using that to power algorithms to more smartly price a trip. And then, what we really have to do is communicate why we're pricing a trip at a certain price more effectively to drivers. So, we're very, very optimistic. The marketplace metrics when we look at ETAs, when we look at conversion rates and driver cancels are all moving in the right direction. And it's about building better algos and improving our pricing going forward, and that's something that is core to, let's say, the skill set of our marketplace team. In terms of UberX Share, we are quite positive in terms of the momentum for UberX Share. We are now expanding X in terms of the markets that we're in. We're now in over 50 markets. In New York, I'm taking this call from New York, we do 100,000 weekly UberX trips every single week. So that product is expanding, and we are showing match rates of over 40% in certain cities in Vancouver or in Toronto, which is incredibly promising in terms of UberX Share being able to drive efficiency in terms of kind of distance efficiency that then we can translate to the consumer. The more data we get about routes and about which routes we have a high probability of matching and which routes we don't have a high probability of matching, we can improve our pricing. So, for example, 30% of trips now are covered by what we call hot routes. A hot route is an upfront discount versus a post-match discount based on the likelihood of matching. So, I would say it's early, but the more combinations we have, the more matches we have in terms of the marketplace, the stronger X Share product becomes. Our U.S. competitor, our significant U.S. competitor, Lyft, is out of that market. So, we think to some extent, this is a great opportunity for us to build out liquidity in shared trips. And it lowers prices for consumers, which is great. And it, obviously, lowers our environmental footprint and reduces congestion in cities as well, which we think, long term, is a very, very good reason to continue to invest in the product. Doug Anmuth : Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Thank you. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a multi-parter on the advertising initiatives. As they continue to scale, what are some of your key learnings with respect the type of advertiser, the different industry verticals that are most attractive to coming in and allocating ad budget across your ad impressions? And how do you see the scaling of ad impressions, whether measured by top of the funnel, bottom of the funnel, sort of brand versus conversion advertising? And how they might scale, given the differences of engagement between the Mobility business and the Delivery business and the different consumer behavior you might see on those platforms? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, Eric, that's quite a mouthful. So, first of all, I would say in terms of our ad business, overall, when you add it all up, our run rate is exceeding about $650 million, and we're making very strong progress towards the $1 billion target that we have in 2024. Today, the vast majority of our ad business are SMBs who are essentially bidding for higher position and higher productivity in the Uber marketplace. The return that they get on their ad spend ranges from 7 times to 9 times return on ad spend. So this is very, very healthy spend that is significantly profitable that essentially allows small and medium businesses to build their business on the Uber platform, and something that we're quite excited about. Some of the new initiatives that we have now are, one, generally extending our reach with enterprise customers. Enterprise customers do have different needs than SMB customers. Typically, they're looking for more targeted advertisements or advertisements during certain times a day. For example, they might want lot of help during breakfast and now as much help, let's say, during dinner time when they're busy anyway. And so, we are now in the process of building out tools that are specifically built for enterprise customers, because as we look at enterprise penetration of their ad spend as a percentage of gross bookings and call it if we have a target about 2% of gross bookings in advertising, enterprise customers right now are significantly lower than that number. And we think building out targeting tools, both in terms of time but also customers, et cetera, for enterprises can increase the enterprise penetration in our marketplace. We think it's a huge, huge opportunity for us. Then, we think the third area that we're focused on are CPG advertisers. So, we launched sponsored items in the last quarter, which enables CPG advertisers to feature priority products within the Uber Eats app. This is a partnership we have with Criteo and CPG spend billions of dollars in advertising. Again, highly targeted advertising for the specific products that they want to promote, again, to a specific audience that's typically a grocery audience that is -- that continues to grow. And then certainly, last but not least, we have a bunch of other products, but the one that I'll mention is our Journey Ads. Journey Ads essentially puts advertisers in front of our Mobility customer. This is a very, very high-end customer. The engagement with the ads is pretty high, at a 3% click-through. And we're pretty excited to introduce video advertising as well to this, both Mobility, Eats, New Verticals audience as well. So, there's a portfolio of products that we're building, highest penetration as SMBs, but we're really building now the full portfolio of the product, including CPG advertisers, enterprise customers, and then getting premium advertisers like Apple in front of our Mobility business as well. Eric Sheridan : Great. Thanks for all the color, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You bet. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. One on Uber One and then another on New Verticals. On Uber One, memberships and volumes continue to be growing steadily. Are you also starting to see now the benefits on contribution margin and profitability as some of the earlier cohorts kind of mature and habituation becomes a part of it? How does profitability or maybe incremental margins of the subscriber base compare versus non-subscribers at this time? And then, on the New Vertical, you noted that it's about 10% of the bookings inside Delivery. Can you give some color on what categories are driving growth primarily right now? And where do you see -- or where does New Verticals stand in terms of profitability versus the core restaurants business? Thank you so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Absolutely. So, in terms of Uber One, we're less focused on profitability generally as we are in driving engagement and retention of the Uber One product. So, Uber One members are profitable, but our profit margins from Uber One members are generally lower because we're delivering on discounts, let's say, delivery discounts are again cashback on their rides. But their lifetime value is significantly higher because members spent 4 times the amount of non-members on a monthly basis and member retention is about 50% greater than non-member retention. So, at this point, we're not really focused on driving member margins. We want to essentially deepen the penetration of members as a percentage of total gross bookings, both across delivery and mobility. Good news is that these members are profitable. I would say we will get to focusing on profitability a year or two years from now, because right now, it's much more about engagement and the general experience. In terms of New Verticals and the categories, the first new vertical category that we penetrated was the convenience category. This is a small shopping cart, $20, $30. And obviously, we have a bunch of convenience merchants out there. We're now much more focused on grocery. These are large basket sizes, appointment viewing, coming back every week. So, our grocery penetration continues to increase, especially as we add new grocers into the New Verticals family. The Uber audience, we've got the largest audience of any platform out there, and we're finding that with our New Verticals partners. 90%-plus of the traffic that they see from Uber is unique and differentiated from their own proprietary traffic or whatever partner that they have before us. So, it's a huge new audience that comes in that is helping us penetrate into the grocery category that we're very excited about. The newest area of New Verticals that we're pretty excited about are also add-ons now. So, these are in circumstances where we see you order from a restaurant and we know that we have other merchants close to that restaurant, especially -- and that courier essentially can go and pick up your food at the restaurant and then go pick up the add-on. We offer those add-ons to you. So, depending on the circumstance, it might be an add-on from a 7-Eleven, it might be wine from a liquor store or for me, which was -- this was my experience last week, it was ice cream, and great ice cream from a small shop nearby. Those add-ons really are an entree into sort of New Verticals world. And what we're seeing is as people order add-ons, one is this incremental volume into the platform, same couriers picking up the two packages, so it's pretty easy and quite delightful for the consumer. But at the same time, it introduces a consumer into this new family of products which now is responsible for the highest percentage of our audience ordering New Verticals on Eats, which is about 13%. We think we have a long way to go there on New Verticals. From a profitability standpoint, we have a couple of countries that are already profitable in New Verticals. But overall, we're losing money on the overall portfolio. But you can see in our overall Delivery business, we're able to significantly improve margins as we take the scale of the business that we're achieving, the cost control of the business, reducing cost per transaction as the marketplace gets more liquid, we can invest some of that money into New Verticals and at the same time, we can increase overall margin. So right now, we think we have a pretty good balance there, and we don't expect that to change. Deepak Mathivanan : Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Can we have the next question? You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Nikhil Devnani : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Dara, helpful to hear the comments on frequency and mobility and see the slide on engagement by ride type. When you look at that slide, it seems like clearly greater usage amongst kind of the lower-cost rides. So, do you feel that you need to bring the overall cost of the service down to keep driving frequency higher? Or do you think that just the new ride types and supply improvements can kind of get you there even if prices are going up with inflation? And then maybe a second question on profitability. Incremental margins keep beating. When you think about this business beyond '24, is there any reason we shouldn't be holding you to that 7% or better framework still? Or is that something we can continue to anchor to? Thank you, both. Nelson Chai : So, I'll start on the incremental margin. So, look, we remain committed to at or above the 7% incremental margins that we've laid out previously. We are going to continue to balance it with continued investments in some of the growth initiatives that folks are asking about. If you look at the midpoint of our Q3 guidance, it implies 9% incremental margins. And if you think about how we performed, so we're halfway through the three-year plan we talked about last February, and as you know, we've overachieved against those every quarter. And so, you should expect that we will continue to do quite well against that framework. But yes, you should expect at least 7% incremental margins for the foreseeable future. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. Nikhil, in terms of your, the frequency question, in typical Uber fashion, I'd say we want both, in that, one, generally, as we find that -- as we increase the choice, the various ways of transportation to consumers regardless of whether it's low cost or high cost, we drive engagement. The average customer who uses more than one product on Uber spent significantly more than the customer who, let's say, only orders UberX. So, I think that there's one set of activities that we have, which is just get you to buy multiple products, whether it's multiple Mobility products or combination of Mobility, Delivery products, that drives engagement and frequency on the platform. The second area that we have is membership. And just mathematically, as we increase the number of members that we have as we increase membership retention and higher gross bookings penetration of members on the platform, members book more. They spend 4 times more. And the frequency is significantly higher. So, mathematically, we will just get higher frequency as well. And then, the third for us is low cost. And if you look at our low-cost product, high-capacity vehicles, Moto, which are 2-wheelers, UberX Share, all of those products have very high frequency. They become a part of everyday life for people. Often they become the primary source of commute for some of our audience and, therefore, we do think that low cost can be a significant differentiator but a significant driver of increasing frequency around the globe. But I think it's all the above. And that's why we're quite confident that we can keep increasing audience and frequency and price, to some extent, on a comparable product to product basis over a long period of time. Nikhil Devnani : Great. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the Lloyd -- sorry, the line of Lloyd Walmsley with UBS. Please go ahead. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Two questions, if I can. First, just looking at kind of your leverage ratio, it looks like it will be set to fall under 3 time post next quarter based on the guide. Is that a magic number or is there a magic number for you all or ratings agencies after which you can actually start to return capital? How should we be thinking about that? And then second one, can you just give us your updated thoughts on the competitive dynamics in the U.S. rideshare market? With competitor prices changing, any impact on share or unit economics to flag out? And then, there have been some reports on reduced booking fees of late. Anything to that or how should we think about that? Is that play into this competitive dynamic in the U.S. market? Thanks. Nelson Chai : So, I'll handle the first question. So, you've heard us on previous calls, our first goal is to make sure that we have adequate cushion on our balance sheet. We've been clear about that from day one that we always have ample liquidity, which we do. You're starting to see the ramp on the free cash flow. That started last year, that you obviously saw this quarter and that we expect to continue for the out quarters. We are -- we have talked in the past about continuing to make progress towards investment grade. So that is important to us. It is not a gating item for which we're going to talk about a capital return or not, because we do know that as you think about in the coming quarters and years that we will continue to ramp in terms of our available free cash. And so, we will evaluate returning excess capital to shareholders as our cash flows ramp over the next few quarters and as we further monetize our equity stakes. So again, I just want to be clear that it's not a gating item, but we do -- we are going to continue to work towards investment grade, Lloyd. And as you know, we -- that's how we've managed from the start, because it is important to make sure you have a very strong balance sheet, and we think it's a huge competitive advantage our cost of capital versus anybody that wants to compete against us. Dara Khosrowshahi : And then in terms of share and booking fees, first of all, on the booking fees, I think there is some kind of a report from [Yipit] (ph). I think it was in terms of booking fees. That data from what we can tell is inaccurate. So, we have updated booking fees and generally rebalanced booking fees based on our insurance costs. Our booking fees cover a number of areas, but insurance costs are a significant portion of that. And we've taken booking fees up in certain markets. For example, Los Angeles, where due to the tort environment and certain abuses, we think of these tort lawyers insurance costs are significantly higher than they are pretty much anywhere else in the country. We increased booking fees. And then in certain other markets, where we have seen effective tort reform, et cetera, Georgia or Virginia, we're able to take prices down for consumers, which is exactly what you want, which puts a higher percentage of, let's say, the earnings in driver pockets, which is terrific. So that was a rebalancing and certainly wasn't as material as the report that we saw. I wouldn't expect any significant movement from that rebalancing. It's just -- it kind of creates more efficiency in the marketplace because we're reflecting the true cost of a trip versus averaging over significant volumes nationwide. So, we think kind of the deaveraging of our platform generally for these costs is able to drive higher marketplace throughput at the right efficiency, which is a goal of that rebalancing. In terms of our share, listen, Lyft is -- was not competitive in terms of pricing. Nine to 12 months ago, they've taken some tough actions, and they are competitive in pricing now. Generally, our pricing is quite comparable to Lyft. And that has resulted in a, I'd say, constructive competitive marketplace. Our category position in terms of gross bookings share continues to be at or close to all-time highs. But we have a competitor there who is a tough competitor, who now is competing effectively. And we think the U.S. is going to be a two-player market for some periods to come. Lloyd Walmsley : All right. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call to Dara Khosrowshahi for closing remarks. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Everyone, thank you very much for joining us, and a big, huge thank you to the Uber team and specially Nelson for taking us from -- through some big ups and big downs and to our first-ever profitable quarter in terms of GAAP operating income. Nelson and I get to talk about it, but it's the result of the work of thousands of employees here at Uber, who are the true heroes. So hopefully, more to come, lots of challenges ahead of us, but thank you to the team and a big thank you to Nelson. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining.

Please note that this call is being recorded. All participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn today's call over to Alax Wang, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Alax Wang : Thank you, operator. Thank you for joining us today and welcome to Uber's third quarter 2023 earnings presentation. On the call today, we have Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, and CFO, Nelson Chai. During today's call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are included in the press release, supplemental slides, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com. As a reminder, these numbers are unaudited and may be subject to change. Certain statements in this presentation and on this call are forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and we do not underwrite any obligation to update any forward-looking statements we make today except as required by law. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today as well as risks and uncertainties described in our most recent Form 10-K and in other filings made with the SEC. We published our quarterly earnings press release, prepared remarks, and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website earlier today, and we ask you to review those documents if you haven't already. We will open the call to questions following brief opening remarks from Dara. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks Alax. Q3 marked another very strong quarter for Uber. Year-on-year trip growth accelerated to 25% from 22% in Q2, outpacing gross bookings growth for the third quarter in a row. Trip growth was powered by strong audience and frequency trends as consumer activity remains robust heading into our busiest period of the year. Notably, monthly trips per MAPC continue to steadily increase matching our all-time high. At the same time, adjusted EBITDA exceeded our Q3 outlook and our adjusted EBITDA margin exceeded 3% for the first time. Simply put, the growth flywheel we built, coupled with rigorous cost discipline, is enabling us to generate strong leverage. We're exiting the year with tremendous momentum and reliable execution. Our Q3 results and Q4 outlook demonstrate that Uber continues to drive profitable growth at scale. We remain focused on scaling GAAP operating income and free cash flow, while also making disciplined investments appropriately fund growth initiatives that will deliver long-term, sustainable financial value. Finally, I want to recognize and thank Nelson for his immense contributions to the company and his partnership with me over the past five years. Looking ahead, I'm thrilled to welcome Prashanth as our new CFO starting tomorrow, and I'm confident that he'll continue to build upon the great foundation that Nelson has built. With that, let's open the call to questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ross Sandler : Hey Dara. Just a couple of questions on the Mobility business. Could you just flesh out a little bit more in detail what the drivers of the acceleration in Mobility gross bookings were third quarter? And as we look out over the next few years, what do you see as the biggest drivers of sustainable mobility gross bookings growth now that we've caught up with the pre-pandemic trip volume and frequency, what do you see for UberX versus the new areas? Thanks a lot. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah, absolutely, Ross. So in terms of Q3, listen, the quarter was strong across the board in every single geography, pretty much in every single product. But a couple of geographies to call out are the Asia Pacific regions and the LatAm regions. These areas accelerated pretty substantially on a year-on-year basis between Q3 and Q2 on big absolute numbers. And some of those countries were very early in penetrating. So, for example, in Japan and South Korea, our penetration rate is miniscule compared to where we are in the rest of the world, and some of the newer products that we're building out, for example, Hailable Taxi are very large parts of the marketplace again in Japan and Taiwan and Hong Kong and South Korea. Then we got products like Moto, which are two-wheelers that are growing very, very quickly in Latin America as well in Brazil and a number of other LatAm markets. So while the growth was pretty broad, I do think that the APAC and LatAm markets, in particular, were super strong, partially because of some of the newer products that we're rolling out. And then if you look more broadly, like we had a very, very strong summer augmented by travel. As you know, travel has been absolutely booming. Leisure travel and Uber has a very high penetration of all the travel consumer. And then what we're seeing now back-to-school is also going very, very strong. So that absolutely added to our Q3 strength and acceleration that frankly surprised us in terms of its strength. In terms of the mobility business and the growth construct, how do we think about the mobility business going forward multiyear, we tend to look at the business from a business construct and then from a user construct. So from a business construct, number one driver for growth, and this is of the core UberX business that grew over 20% on a year-on-year basis is about adding more drivers to the platform. We added \u2013 we're now at 6.5 million earners on a form, up over 30% on a year-on-year basis. And this is a supply-led marketplace as we add more drivers, the marketplace gets more liquid, ETAs come down, surge come down, that pushes essentially demand. So adding more drivers essentially drives the marketplace. Then on top of that base business, we have the new growth initiatives that we have, these are businesses that we've really built in the past five years, essentially from zero. These are hailables products, taxi, three-wheelers, two dealers, our Uber for Business product that is actually seeing some strength now, which is great. Our UberX Share and low-cost products such as high-capacity vehicles and then reserve as well. That collective is now $9 billion and is growing over 80% on a year-on-year basis. And then on top of that, you've got international markets with very big GDPs, where, as you know, we just weren't in those markets five years ago, and we've tuned our business model to be able to penetrate into those markets. These are the Germany, Spain, Argentina that grew more than 150% on a year-on-year basis; Japan, South Korea and Turkey. So really, you've got a base business that's driven by supply. On top of that, you have a bunch of new products that are big $9 billion annual run rate growing over 80%. And then you've got these international markets, which are big GDP markets that we've got very low penetration too. So that's the business construct. And then the other way that we look at the business is actually from a consumer view, and that's about driving new audience, driving frequency and then price as well. So if you think about audience, all of these new markets, the international markets that we're getting to, many of them are entirely new audiences or when we introduce taxi into a small village in the UK, that's a new audience that comes on to our platform. Then when we think about audience, we think about demographics. So for example, for the high-income consumer, we're introducing products like reserve, where you can pay more for higher reliability and we're seeing that reserve usage is actually incremental. And then for lower-income consumers, we're introducing like UberX Share, or high capacity vehicles, et cetera. So demographically, we're expanding internationally, we're expanding. And then we also look at age. So like we introduced Uber for teens, for younger consumers, turns out teens tend to use Uber just as much as adults do, which is great. And we think they'll continue to use it as they grow up. So that's the audience kind of construct for us, which is global, income level and age, and we have products specifically for all three of those. And then when you get into frequency, only one-third of our annual users use us on a monthly basis. So our job is to increase that one-third. Membership is a very, very big driver there. As you -- we got now 15 million Uber One members. Members spent four times more than non-members, so as we penetrate into the membership frequency naturally increases. All of the use cases that we're introducing like reserve, drive frequency as well -- and then what we're also seeing is that users who use more than one product on mobility and delivery tend to spend more on the platform. They spend up to three times more, for example, in mobility, if they take two different products as well. That draws frequency as well. And then price this year essentially has been flattish, and that's a good thing. But I think going forward, you can expect our services to grow price along with inflation as well. So if you're driving audience, driving frequency and then prices kind of ore price takers, so to speak, you get to a pretty good growth construct over the long-term. Ross Sandler : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Nowak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two sort of somewhat higher level, Dara. First of all, I want to ask you is sort of on the types of machine learning or data analytics that you've done on the platform so far. Give us some examples of where you'd be able to improve matching, improve conversion on the platform? And where do you still see more opportunities to improve that as you kind of look into 2024? And then the second one, there's been a lot written in the press about new potential product extensions, travel, you mentioned B2B, et cetera. As you look at these, which of these new potential products have you most excited that could move the needle over the next couple of years? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely, Brian. So I think on the ML front, it's actually hard to say where ML can improve because it's pretty much in every part of our business. Like we've been developing and using machine learning for many, many years now. Just a couple of examples might be like earner on-boarding, right? You take that for granted. But actually, now what we're using is we're using machine learning technology to like Computer Vision to essentially allow the machines to recognize documents more to reliably, transcribe them accurately so that your on-boarding experience and the time to onboard could be reduced drastically, errors can be reduced as well. So, essentially, machines can read these documents better than humans can. That's one example. On the productivity front, we're rolling out GitHub Copilot for software developers. We have already seen, because of investments that we've made in our tooling, our average software developer is much more productive now than they were two years ago, and we think that GitHub Copilot will improve productivity and hopefully will also reduce mistakes on the platform as well. So, they will have ML algorithms debug developer code before that code kind of is tested, et cetera. So, we think that's -- that can increase the productivity of our business as well. We're pretty excited about conversational support. So, these are large language-based tools that essentially help our customer service agents. They will go through customer history that get details about the particular issue that the customer might be calling about or chatting about, and we'll be giving recommendations on what to do based on our policies all around the world. Humans have to kind of go through all these kinds of policies. Now, machines do, they give humans a recommendation. And eventually, then machines are going to be talking with our customers on the front line as well. And then on the delivery marketplace and the mobility marketplace, we've been using advanced machine learning algos for routing, for matching, for pricing, all of these algos generally improve on a year-on-year basis and accrue hundreds of millions of dollars of either incremental bookings that call it VC neutral or an improved chain algorithms to reduce, let's say, cost per transaction on the delivery space. So, these are just some of the areas where ML is working out. And listen, for us, ML is a powerful technology, period. But because we're the largest player in the world, we are gathering more data for more customers across a wider range of behaviors than anybody else. So, we think in a world where ML becomes more important Uber becomes competitively stronger, so to speak, because of the set of data that we have that's really unmatched and unrivaled, including customers who are engaging both in the mobility and the delivery marketplace. So, it's pretty powerful. In terms of the other use cases that we're seeing, listen, Uber for Business is something that's very, very promising. We continue to penetrate into the corporate space. It's great to see companies now get their travelers on the road again and we definitely saw an uptake there. But with Uber for Business, we're also looking at verticals like health and transit as well that are very, very healthy and hold a ton of promise. For me, travel is something that's very much in my heart because of my old Expedia days. And we've talked about travel being a very, very strong kind of signal for Uber and travelers typically using Uber because of our global footprint, kind of perspective here. In 2022, nearly 700 million trips globally were taken by consumer that's out of their primary city, which is pretty amazing. And every quarter, about 20% of our users took a domestic trip outside of their primary cities. So our users, they're high-income earners, they tend to travel a lot and that becomes a good segment for us to target. We've done so in the UK where we're quite optimistic about our travel business in the UK and some of the early signals that we see, for example, in the UK, you can book trains and buses, 60% of train and coach users and 25% of our flight users are now repeat users on Uber as well. So they try the product because we have a big audience. But more importantly, they're coming back to the product, which is great. So we got multiple avenues for growth and travel and business are just one amongst many honestly. Brian Nowak : Okay. Thanks, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much. And first, thanks to Nelson for all the insights and conversations over the years. Thanks. I wish you best going forward. Maybe Dara, I think two bigger picture ones for you. One on Uber One. As it continues to scale globally and the base of subscribers continues to build, what are some of the early learnings that have now translated into scale about how you're thinking about bringing that subscription to market more globally than in the early years and what that might mean for the business in the years ahead? That's number one. And then on driver supply. We were in a very different position a year ago where you were using a lot of incentives on driver supply. As we come out of that period and things have normalized, how are you thinking about optimizing driver supply for efficiency cost, maybe even insurance? So we should be thinking about that as an initiative going forward? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, Eric. So as far as Uber One goes and lessons learned there, honestly, the Uber One customer behavior has been pretty darn consistent in that Uber One consumers spend four times the amount that nonmembers do monthly basis. And retention is more than 15% higher for members versus nonmembers. That pattern has remained. There were some question as to, A, as we expand the user base, is that ForEx going to come down to a 3x, for example, but that hasn't happened. The 4x and the 15% retention have continued. The focus now for us with Uber One, I'd say is threefold. One is keep expanding geographically. And we just introduced Uber One into a couple of more markets as well. So now we've got 15 million members across 18 countries. Number two is really focused on Uber One retention. And when you look at the Uber One benefits, the benefits are typically monetary in nature. So you get discounts on your food, you get delivery for free. You get cash back on mobility. What we want to do going forward is also provide benefits that are non-monetary in nature, let's say, advanced matching upgrades to different cars or head of the queue matching when you get into an airport, where there aren't that many cars around. Those are more nonmonetary benefits that we think that our members will very much appreciate. And the design spec there is to drive member retention. Retention levels are high, but they can always get higher, and we always want to make sure that we're not kind of driving just member growth, we also want to drive retention as well. And the third area is really optimizing around our mobility use case. Delivery already members account for more than 40% of bookings with mobility, it's in the mid-teens. It's much earlier in terms of penetration. And I think we can do a lot more in terms of the member experience for mobility users and just continuing to optimize that. Turning to the driver supply question. Our supply position is the best that it's been. We've got over 6.5 million earners. And I would say those earners are actually earning this quarter, $15.9 billion, which is up 23% on a constant currency basis. So we're really proud of our being one of the largest earnings, if not the largest earnings platform in the world in a flexible way and the fact that earnings are actually going up faster than gross bookings, which is something that we're proud of. And at the same time, we're driving \u2013 we're driving the bottom line and free cash flow for investors that's super attractive as well. That said, we are optimizing around our earners costs. So we don't have to lean into incentives the way that we did previously. So if you look at our incentive spend for earners, it's down about 41% on a year-on-year basis. Globally, it's down about 50% in the US because with the liquidity of the marketplace kind of natural earnings levels are high at about $33 per utilized hour across the US. It's $50 here in New York City per utilized hours. So earning levels were high. That allows us to take incentives down. But we're also working on other parts of on-boarding efficiency, when we run a background check, for example, for a driver, and running it background check. If we qualify a driver, if we know that driver is highly, highly interested running a background check, if we don't think we can qualify, let's say, that earner delaying the background check that again delays expenses as well. So across \u2013 across the business up bringing earners on, not just incentives, we're looking to optimize the cost there and so far, so good. Next question. You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Ron Josey with Citi. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the non-X gross bookings now at that $9 billion run rate growing 80%. Are any of these new offerings, talk to us about how these new opportunities creating demand? And any other product specifically, seeing greater demand versus others, meaning Reserve, Comfort, Green, UberX, things along those lines? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. So these products are definitely creating demand, and they create demand in different ways. So for example, Hailables or taxi product, if you look at the number, the percentage of new customers coming in from Hailables, it's about twice the percentage of gross bookings that taxi represents. That's because in a bunch of markets, actually, the only way we can penetrate into those markets is through taxi. Japan, as an example. We have a very, very small, high-end peer-to-peer business. But we're going in partnering with taxis in Japan. We actually just joined the taxi association in Japan as well. And those taxies essentially our brand-new supply introduced us to a whole new audience in Japan. And actually, the tourists coming into Japan as well kind of supports the local economy. So that's an entirely new audience. That's true in many parts of Argentina, in Turkey, where these new business models essentially are bringing new audience. The other one that I will point out to are low-cost products. So if you look at UberX Share, for example. It is taking some trips away from our UberX business do see kind of lower income move to UberX Share faster. So we think that's providing them relief based on kind of the economic hardships and all the inflation that we're seeing there. So we're absolutely seeing a higher penetration of UberX Share for lower-income consumers, but it's also introducing us to a new audience as well. Same thing in Moto. These are two-wheelers in Latin America, and again, newer lower income audience that previously could afford Uber, now can afford Uber as well. So, all of these either drive audience or frequency or both. And obviously, they're strategic in terms of our long-term growth formula. Ron Josey : Great. Thank you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Doug Anmuth : Thanks for taking the question. One for Dara and one for Nelson. Dara, what do you view as some of the primary compounding advantages you're currently achieving just across operational best practices? And where do you see the biggest opportunities going forward? And Nelson, you've improved profit significantly over the past year, incremental margin is now running at about 9% in 3Q. How are you thinking about key investments in hiring into 2024? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Absolutely, Doug. So in terms of the compounding advantages, I'll go back to what I was talking about in terms of machine learning, which is becoming a much more important part of the business. So we're just -- we have more data points in terms of opportunities to match riders to drivers or eaters to restaurants to couriers. And for example, if you take a look at our driver upfront pricing, the change that we made, it had a huge benefit for drivers, right? Drivers can see where their destination is and as a result, can accept or not accept that trip based on destination and upfront price that they see. It's a very, very powerful driver of the business. But it also is another opportunity for us to price out that trip. Previously, drivers are paid based on time and distance. Anyone can price based on time and distance. So the amount of data that you have doesn't help you calculate a certain per mile rate and a certain time rate as well. So there's zero kind of benefit to scale. Now in a world where drivers know their destination, we can price out that destination. We have more opportunities to price. We have more drivers than anyone else in the marketplace. So we'll be able to price up that trip and match it to a particular driver based on a bigger data set than anyone else in the world that advantage compounds as our machine learning kind of platform learns more about different trips, which ones are accepted, which ones are not accepted, which ones are canceled as well. So all of our marketplace mechanisms in terms of routing, in terms of matching, in terms of pricing, now are essentially point estimates that we can train on a larger database than anyone else. If you look at payments, for example, we announced a great new partnership with PayPal and our ability to -- we're one of the largest players out there in terms of bookings, $35 billion in bookings in a quarter, growing at a rate that most players our size aren't growing. So on the payment side, for example, we think we can secure a lower payment cost than other players, that's going to compound. If you look at parts of our business like detecting fraudulent activity, there are lots of rosters out there. They are being armed by machine learning, and we can detect patterns across a greater set of use cases, both in mobility and delivery so that we can identify, let's say, the bad folks from the good folks, differentiate them and reject the bad folks and have them maybe try to steal from other platforms. All of these different parts of the business are compounding in one way or the other. Many of them are powered by machine learning. And again, if you've got the most data in the world, your ML algos typically have an advantage over smaller players. Nelson Chai : So Doug, in terms of our ability to balance growth and profitability, as you know, since we have public, Dara and I have been talking about our capital allocation process, we laid out our three-year targets last year. And if you look at the performance of the company, we've been in line with the top line and overachieved at the bottom every single quarter. And if you look at the guidance, again, it's very, very, very constructive, if you think about it. You heard Dara talk a lot about where the business is going and some of the growth, our mobility business, the gross bookings were up 30% in Q3. And that's why we're continuing to invest in the businesses. So if you think about it, where we are today on both delivering the bottom line, but investing for the future, we're starting to see some of these new growth initiatives scale, new mobility products, $9 billion gross bookings run rate, new verticals are at a $6 billion gross bookings run rate. So we're delivering the bottom line. We're delivering free cash flow. We've delivered GAAP operating income, as we've talked about over the past three years, while driving a lot of top line growth. And so the business is in terrific shape as you think about how we're going into 2424 and beyond. And again, we are balancing our capital allocation model. We probably do a little optimized to make sure we deliver on the bottom, but we are able to fund certain growth initiatives. So we have a lot of confidence in terms of where we are. And as you heard from Dara's commentary on all the growth vectors we have, we're pretty bullish about where the company has had it. Doug Anmuth : Thank you both. Nelson Chai : You bet. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Benjamin Black : Great. Thanks for taking the question. You, obviously, got a nice regulatory win in New York last week, but we still have the DOL on the EU platform directive, Prop. 22 in California. So it\u2019d be great, if you can give us a lay of the land on the registry front? And do you feel comfortable operating in any employment classification outcome? And then just quickly, there are clearly concerns around the crisis in the Middle East. We've heard from other travel companies. Could you help size your exposure there? And have you seen any impact to demand since the conflict began? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Absolutely. So in terms of the regulatory framework, the first thing I'd say is we can operate under any regulatory framework. So we think the right framework is the framework that preserves flexibility for drivers and couriers, while providing them protections. And, for example, our settlement with New York AG and the DOL provides for earners to be able to earn flexibly on the platform with minimum earnings and other protections as well, insurance protections that we think is the right framework going forward. It's the same framework that voters voted for in Prop. 22 in California. And if I look big picture, generally, the world is moving towards this model, which is earned flexibly with benefits such as minimum earnings and other benefits out there that are important on a state-by-state basis or on a country-by-country basis. And for us, it's really entering into dialogue with all the constituencies to get to the right solution there. There are some markets where drivers or employees for example, fleets with which we do business. This is in some of our European businesses, European end markets. They are employees of fleets. We contract with these fleets, and these fleets are on our platform as well. And those markets are profitable as well. The price to the end consumer is higher and drivers, frankly, missed the flexibility that they have in markets where independent contractor plus model is the right model going forward. So if I zoom out, the regulatory framework that we see is not about whether or not we're in a market or not, whether or not we do business there or not. It's about whether or not our earners have flexibility to work on our platform, the way that they want to work on our platform, when they want to work on our platform, where they want to work on our platform and what the price is to the end consumer. And generally, I would say that across the world, this -- there are absolute exceptions. Most countries, most states are moving in the direction of flexibility, plus benefits and protections. And then in terms of the Middle East. So the Middle East is about -- represents about 2% of our overall gross bookings of the business. So it's a relatively small part of our business. Now certain parts of the Middle East are quite profitable. So it's a very attractive geography to us. Generally, we are seeing some weakness in a couple of countries in the Middle East, Egypt, for example, is one that I would point out. But we don't operate in Israel. We don't operate in the West Bank, so we're not affected in any way directly. And any weakness that we see in the Middle East is very, very small compared to the rest of the business. We were a little worried. Will companies cut back on travel? Will people come back general on travel? And actually, with our Uber for Business segment, we're seeing travel spend up, whereas some of the company that we contracted with were saying either no travel or travel when necessary, now let's kind of use your judgment and we're seeing a bit of acceleration in our room for business, which is quite encouraging going forward. Benjamin Black : Great. Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Ken Gawrelski : And let me reiterate. Thanks, Nelson, for the partnership over the years. Two questions, if I may. First, you talked about just broadening out a little bit on the macro side. I know you just talked about the Middle East specific exposure. But you could talk -- could you talk a little bit more broadly. Some of your travel-related peers have seen macro weakness more broadly than the Middle East into October. Why do you think ride share growth quarter-to-date hasn't been impacted? And then I guess maybe the bigger picture question there is how do you think more broadly about the economic sensitivity of the business? And then the second question, please, is if active driver growth continues to outpace trip growth, how do you think about balancing a potential take rate opportunity versus expanding use cases and growing the addressable market? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. So in general, listen, we've been looking for pockets of consumer spending weakness across our platforms, both our mobility platform and delivery platform. We read the news. We watch CNBC just like anyone else. And frankly, we haven't found it. I think part of the reason is that when you look at consumer spend, one of the US consumer is incredibly strong. And two, I think within the consumer spend bucket, if you look at spend on services versus spend on retail, spend on services is still not back to where pre-pandemic spend was. So we do think that there -- the tailwind that we've seen in terms of spend on services continues, it could continue going forward. It's very difficult to predict. And what we have seen with Uber is that Uber is a local type of product. So I do think that consumers during periods of elevated perceived risk, they sometimes pull back on higher, call it, higher spend product, whether it's renovating their house or booking a big vacation during uncertain times that they may not, but they'll treat themselves to break food Sushi delivered to them or they still go out to restaurants. They still go see their friends. So I think the local nature of our business makes us relatively resistant to macro uncertainty because it's usually the big, the large price product that get priced out first. In terms of active driver growth, we are -- active driver growth is absolutely growing faster at this point than trips. We generally want to keep take rate as low as possible because we think that's the right thing to do long-term and kind of is the -- allows us to compound for a much longer time period. Now incentives are of our take rate. And as we said, incentive spend has been down pretty substantially on a year-on-year basis. And so that is a tailwind on our take rate -- but otherwise, what we want to do is to maximize long-term free cash flow growth, maximize long-term earnings per share at the lowest take rate that we can because it drives us to be more efficient as a business going forward. So we try not to kind of push take rate opportunistically, because the cycle is going to move the other way and when it moves the other way, it's really going to hurt if you're not structured with a low cost base. Ken Gawrelski : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Morton with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Michael Morton : Hi, thank you for the question. Wanted to talk a little bit about the new growth opportunities in mobility. In the past Dara, you've spoken about aspiration for reserve penetration of like total airport trips. And I'd love to know if we're seeing the product in the market for some time now. How you see this opportunity, how large it could get reserves as a percentage of airport bookings? And then looking outside of travel and airport bookings, maybe the impact you think reserve could have on the other aspects of the mobility business? And then just a second question, a quick one. On your advertising product, you've really made a lot of progress since rolling this out. And I would love to learn some more about how you believe your offering meets the needs from large enterprises. It seems like there's a lot of demand for the large sophisticated enterprises, but they are more demanding when it comes to advertising solutions and the product has historically been overweight to kind of SMBs. So, any update there would be great as well. Thank you so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. So, in terms of reserve, listen, reserve is a very, very promising product continues to grow at significant rates. But it's still pretty early in terms of reserve development. We typically now account for one out of the four legs of the airport. If you go to the airport, you get picked up and then you come back and you get picked up, et cetera, we typically only cover one out of those four legs. So, we think that increased penetration at airport is absolutely a significant opportunity for us, and we're very early in that penetration. I do think that reserve as a product, while it's very good at picking up at your home, dropping off at the airport or picking up at your hotel and getting you to the airport on your way back, I think we can do a lot more in terms of experience for the rider who is arriving in the airport. We have you put in your flight information so that the driver knows when you're arriving. We automatically account for delays, et cetera. You can upload the information from your Hulu calendar onto our product, et cetera. So, there's a lot that we've done. There's some hyper optimization to be done in terms of arrivals and generally for airport pricing algorithms whereas we were pricing generally for the market, now we're focused on really the airport experience. And I think the airport experience in terms of finding where the pickup area is, the pricing, the supply that we have in our airports is something that -- it's best of breed. But frankly, I think we can improve on. We are seeing some reserve usage for other types of use cases going out to dinner, et cetera. And there, we think it's about optimizing the premium that reserve represents over UberX versus the reliability. And there is a trade-off there. If you want the 99.9% reliability in reserve, the premium over UberX on Demand will be quite high. And on a market-by-market basis and kind of on a consumer segment by consumer segment basis, we're trying to optimize what's that trade-off between price and reliability that can maximize our reserve volume and again, we think there's a lot more optimization to be done there. In terms of advertising for large entities, I think your question is spot on in that the majority of our ad revenue at this point is SMBs, et cetera. It's a pretty simple pay for audience and pay for additional business model. The return on ad sales are excellent. Return on ad sales are on average, anywhere from 7x to 10x your spend. So, this is a very profitable endeavor for our product for our partners, which is great. We are building out more sophisticated technology for our larger advertisers that, frankly, will also offer to our smaller advertisers. They may be, for example, amongst other products, the ability to target new customers and then being able to track those new customers when they become repeat customers. For grocery products, for example, is to integrate their membership and loyalty programs into Uber Eats so that their loyalty -- their loyalty consumers can go direct or they can go through Eats and kind of in that way, they get to build the relationship with those loyalty members as well. We are working increasingly on building out tool sets that can help larger advertisers measure the incrementality of the advertising and not just the return on ad sales of that advertising as well. And then we're also helping our larger advertisers with dayparts. They may, for example, we've had certain larger advertisers. We really want to promote breakfast and want to go over promote breakfast, because it's something -- introducing, and we allow kind of daypart targeting as well. So all of these are relatively newer tools, and we think those tools are going to get a higher penetration of the larger advertisers, both in our Uber Eats business, but just as importantly, CPG advertisers for our grocery business. And of course, we got into the branded business in our Mobility segment and our Delivery segment as well. So we think we're well on our way to $1 billion plus, which was a target for our ad business that we set a few years ago. And we continue to be very, very pleased with our progress. And there's a lot of potential in this business. So we're not nearly even midstream in terms of its development. Michael Morton : Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Next question. I think we got one more. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks. Two questions, please. You talk about this net headcount being down roughly 1% sequentially and looking for ways to demonstrate further operating leverage going forward. Are you at a point now where you can roughly keep headcount flattish or just growing low single-digit percent for the foreseeable future? And then secondly, you talk about in the next earnings call, I think over next quarter, you're going to provide an update on returning capital to shareholders. Could you I know you'll make that announcement then, but what are the options, a reasonable range of options that investors should think about with that? Thanks a lot. Nelson Chai : So in terms of the headcount, yes, Mark, we do believe that we can continue to move forward with flat or very small incremental headcount. And so that's what we are planning as we go forward. As you know, we've pretty -- we've had pretty steadfast since 2019 in terms of where the headcount has been. And we continue to get that operating leverage, and you're seeing in the bottom line. And so the team is pushing hard to try to maintain that discipline because, again, we continue to try to deliver. While we're investing, by the way, in the growth that you heard Dara outlined before, so we certainly can. In terms of capital returns, so as you know, I'm handing the ton over to my able new partner over here, who's going to -- who's kind of stepping in tomorrow as CFO. So it's certainly one of the first priorities that he and Dara are going to walk through. He's fortunate because he's getting a business that's in great shape, as you know. As you know, we are now eligible for S&P inclusion. And so it's really a matter from a corporate action perspective of an opportunity. We're well on our way to investment grade as well. So he'll get that benefit as well. And so he also understands the fact that capital return is something that's come up from investors. We've been pretty workmanlike in terms of two years ago, we talked about getting the EBITDA profitability. Last year, we talked about getting to free cash flow. This year, we talked about getting to GAAP operating income at some point. And as you know, especially based on where our projections are, will be GAAP operating income for the full year. And so we know next year capital return will be a big question. And I know if you look at his background, he has a lot of experience in terms of doing it. You know the forms, whether it's buybacks or dividends, I think that you will look at the full suite and has a lot of experience in his past life doing it. So I'm confident that when he addresses investors in February, which I believe will be the next time that he'll be ready to at least give a perspective on that for investors. Mark Mahaney : Thanks, Nelson. Wishing you all the best. Nelson Chai : Thank you very much, Mark. Operator : This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back to Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, for any closing remarks. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Thank you, everyone, for joining us in this quarter. Huge thanks to the Uber team who keeps delivering with flatter down headcount, which is pretty amazing. They're working pretty hard. Thank you to our partners, our restaurant partners, earners without whom we wouldn't be able to deliver any of these services. And then a big thank you again, we said it before, but I'll say it again to Nelson, who has been an incredible partner on this journey. I think Nelson was saving the best for last, and this is definitely the best. So thank you, Nelson, for everything you've contributed to the company. We wouldn't be here without you. Nelson Chai : So first of all, I should say this. So I'm really, really proud of the collective work that we've all done over my five years. The company is really, really well-positioned to continue to grow at scale to deliver increasing profitability and free cash flow. My hope is the company continues to maintain the discipline that's allowed us to deliver against our commitments. And I do want to thank Dara for his partnership and all of Uber, because it's really given me an incredible opportunity, and I'm very proud of the work we've done together and to come into a company that's the verb and leave in such good shape, I think, is about all you can ask for. So again, I thank you. And I really thank Dara a lot for his partnership because we've been great partners over the five years. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Nelson. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Uber Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Alex Wang, Head of Investor Relations. Alex, you may begin your conference. Alax Wang : Thank you, Krista. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Presentation. On the call today we have Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi; and CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. During today's call, we'll present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are included in the press release, supplemental slides and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com. Certain statements in this presentation and on this call are forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements we make today, except as required by law. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today as well as risks and uncertainties described in our most recent Form 10-K and other filings made with the SEC. We published our quarterly earnings press release, prepared remarks and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website earlier today, and we ask you to review those documents if you haven't already. We will open the call to questions following brief opening remarks from Dara and Prashanth. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Alex. Q4 was a standout quarter to cap off a standout year. Trip growth of 24% year-on-year outpaced gross bookings growth for the fourth quarter in a row, powered by strong audience trends and record engagement as consumer activity remained healthy all-around the world. At the same time adjusted EBITDA of $1.3 billion exceeded our Q4 outlook with GAAP operating income of $652 million. Looking back, 2023 was an inflection point for Uber providing -- proving that we can continue to generate strong profitable growth at scale. These results in our Q1 outlook demonstrate that we're starting 2024 with tremendous momentum and reliable execution. I'm energized by the pace of innovation I'm seeing across the company and I'm looking forward to another exciting year ahead. And now here's Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Dara. And let me add my welcome to our Q4 earnings call. As a reminder, we will be hosting an Investor Update next week on Wednesday, February 14th to present an updated view of our strategy and capital allocation plans. As such, we kindly ask that you keep your questions today, focused on our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. And with that, let's open the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Douglas Anmuth : Thanks so much for taking the question. As you come off of 2023, we have grown bookings 20% and achieved positive GAAP operating income and net income and driven meaningful free cash flow. Can you just talk more about your top priorities as you enter 2024? How you shift Uber to become more of an everyday product and what are some of the key strategic investment areas that you're most focused on? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, great question, Doug. So, I think for us, the good news is that, the strategy remains largely the same. If I were to broaden in terms of Mobility, first and foremost, it's about making certain that our supply position, the number of drivers that we have on the road and engagement of those drivers continues to be healthy because that is what drives overall marketplace health. And you can never forget about the basics. The number of drivers we have on the platform was up 30% year-on-year. With engagement, average -- engagement also being up 10%. So we still drivers of the heart of the business. And as long as we've got drivers who are earning as they are, for example, in the US $33 per utilized hour and staying on the platform for longer that platform stays healthy. We have more people coming in. At the same time we're augmenting that base platform with a number of new initiatives that we've got in place, newer products. This thesis are you for be enterprise business that's actually showing nice strength early in the year. Reserve for folks who are willing to pay more for better reliability for those travel locations. For example, low cost product as well and then taxis and two-wheelers and three-wheelers. So you've got a base business that's growing at fast rates. Typically, gaining category position against many competitors. And then, augmented by some of these faster-growing products. In delivery it's very similar, which is, adding more restaurants, making sure the reliability of services is excellent. You've seen that business actually accelerate its growth from 16% topline to 17%, while significantly increasing margins as well. And that's augmented by new services such as grocery, which is now $7 billion run-rate and growing at very healthy rates. And then advertising, which we told you would be a $1 billion run-rate business next year, which is going to surpass that. We're already at a $900 million plus run-rate just in Q4 of this year. So again, strong base business, augmented by these new exciting businesses that add both top-line and margin as well. And then all of it is going to be undergirded by the power of the platform. First and foremost that their technology platform, all of the algos we have that are matching drivers to riders or matching couriers to go pick up something at a grocery store and deliver to home on time. So it's a technical platform that's doing all the matching, routing driven by AI. And then other factors like our membership program, which is up to 19 million members. And then, of course, cross-selling across the platform, which continues to increase Uber users who buy across platform, let's say, if they are taking UberX and order on Uber Eats will on average order three times more than those who don't. So I think as we look forward, it's more of the same and increasing the scale of each of these efforts, because as you can see we're growing faster than competition on a global basis. We continue to improve margins. And now that we're profitable, that creates other possibilities as well. So I think that's what we're, kind of, if next year is the same as this year just with bigger numbers, I'll be happy. Douglas Anmuth : Great. Thank you. Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe following up on Doug's broader question and spreading it out around the globe. Curious if there were any geographic areas, you wanted to call out exiting 2024 and looking into 2024, where you see elements of either improved market share position or elements of driving the utility around Uber One and linking more Mobility activity with more delivery activity that we should keep an eye on as we move deeper into 2024. Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, Eric, what I'll start with is actually Delivery, and what we're quite happy to see is that, for example, our Delivery business, which, again, accelerate our gross bookings growth this year grew category position in 10 out of its top 10 markets. So the growth that you see from us and with Delivery is substantially in excess of the category. It's partially and mostly the great execution of the team in terms of the basics, which is adding more selection, bringing in more consumers, bringing in more carriers, making sure that the reliability of the service improves, and making sure that errors improve as well. You don't get your food late, but then again it is that power of the platform, right? Which is, our Uber Eats business is getting significant free traffic from rides or close to free traffic from rides. And then of course the membership program continues to be a larger and larger portion of our business. Now, about 45% of Delivery gross bookings are coming from membership, and that just mathematically drives frequency. And if you look at Delivery, audience is up, frequency is up, basket size is up as well. So the growth comes, it's very broad growth and more of the growth this year is coming from transactional growth versus pricing growth relative to last year. Last year was more pricing growth than transaction growth. Now it's the other way around. And that really is broad. In Mobility, I would say, standouts were Latin-America and APAC. Again, we had very strong broad growth around the world. But we've seen very strong growth, particularly in Asia-Pacific, the Japanese market is super strong, Korea is starting to come up. Australia remains very strong. Taiwan, et cetera. So all of these markets are strong. I think it's augmented by taxis. India for us is super strong and we are gaining category position versus our big competitor there. And we think we're the larger player. Making a lot of progress with two-wheelers. And then Latin America, it's really two-wheelers model. It's a lower-cost product, that is the hero. It's a newer product, trip growth there is incredibly healthy. So Latin-American trip growth was absolutely standout this year. Eric Sheridan : Thank you. Alax Wang : Next question. You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Brian Nowak : Thanks, good morning guys. I have two, one for Dara, one for Prashanth, Dara I mean you've talked a lot over the 2023 period about sort of increasing frequency and increasing engagement on the overall platform. Can you just talk to us about sort of operationally and from an investment perspective, what are sort of the key areas, you need to invest and to continue to turn more miles into wows and wows and [indiscernible] et cetera, how do you do that operationally? And then the second one, Prashanth, you've had a little time on top of the hood and now sort of under the hood, just sort of talk to us about, maybe one or two of the things that you think are most surprising and under-appreciated internally versus externally now you've sort of gotten to know the company a little better. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. I like your phraseology there. Listen, I think in terms of frequency, I know there's a bunch of sexy stuff that people talk about, but the most important factor in terms of frequency is being a service that is reliable and predictable every single day for every single occasion. So for Mobility, it's making sure that ETAs are at constructive levels, making sure that surge typically has less than, let's say 20% of sessions, and both of those are moving in the right direction and especially in Q1, they are moving in the right direction. And then for Delivery, Jeff, taking out any errors in terms of you're missing a drink et cetera, making sure that if we make a delivery promise of 25 minutes, we deliver in 25 minutes. So I think those are the basics. Now, the advantage or one of the advantages that we have is the platform, which is, as we see our users engage with more than one product, those users tend to come back more often and tend to stick around for longer. So we have now a team that is essentially using AI algorithms, and there are a number of promotions that we -- that we have lined-up. So if you are going to work, if we know that you're committing to work for breakfast, we may have a promotion for you to up a coffee at Starbucks. If you're coming home from work and we know it's around 6 :30, and that's when you order dinner, we may say why don't you order a pizza, it'll be home for your family, by the time you get there. All of these occasions, there are different occasions that we can target the right person with the right offer at the right price. All of that now is algorithmically driven. And it's pretty powerful because it's gone from, I'd say like programing, a third of the time, let's throw this promotion and a third of the time let's do another promotion. As it turns algorithmic, as it becomes much more targeted and personalized, the part of the platform increases. And that generally just mathematically moves frequency the right direction. The last point that I would make is, again, membership too is just a tailwind for us for frequency. We got 19 million members, up significantly on a year-on-year basis. Members buy more, they stay longer and just mathematically members will account for higher percentage of gross bookings, which means a higher percentage of customers are going to stick around for longer, and transact more frequently. Prashanth, you want to take the second question? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Good morning, Brian. And thank you for giving me a softball to start with. So if I think about kind of my observations over the last three months now, under the hood using your expression, I would say what I found most surprising is the -- just the level of excitement and energy within the organization in the focus they have on building products for user, for earners and for partners. It's a very mission-driven company. I know that's an expression you often hear, a lot of tech companies use. But I'm really experiencing it within the four walls of Uber. I'll say the other learning that has been very, very encouraging for someone coming in is just the internal conviction and planned around driving profitable growth. And there is a -- there is tremendous runway that this organization has over the next couple of years to continue focusing not just on growth, but also making sure that, that growth comes with significant profit leverage. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ross Sandler : Great. Dara, the Mobility incremental margin bounced back pretty nicely to 10%, you guys said on the last quarter, this would move around a bit. So how do we think about the outlook on that going forward. And as these new areas like reserve, which has higher margin, but taxi or shared rides has lower margin, as those come and the mix starts to change, how do we think about Mobility incrementals going forward? Thanks a lot. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, good morning, Ross. I'm going to take that question. So before I jump into incremental margins, maybe I'll just take a minute to talk about, as we go forward, we'd like to focus really on EBIT dollar growth. Given the power of the platform, the leverage that we're generating off of our revenue growth where we're pretty excited about the absolute EBIT dollar growth we're going to be able to generate over the coming quarters. And we think that's a better metric for us because it allows us to really share with you a better proxy for our ability to generate cash flow. Having said that, I do want to talk specifically to incremental margin. So you're referring to that in Q4, incremental margins grew sequentially for the Mobility business. And as a reminder, that can bounce around a little bit based on mix and also based on the investment decisions that we make. So I wouldn't put too much focus on continued expansion of incremental margins. We feel very comfortable that the overall incremental margins for Uber are going to continue to be something that is going to pull the overall profitability of the company up. But remember that, we will always be making investments in areas that -- such as our growth bets that you referred to, whether it be Hailables or in new geographies that are going to put some pressure on that. But overall look for continued growth in EBITDA margins. But probably a little less acceleration in incremental margins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Justin Post : Great, thanks. I'll ask a couple of things, we got a ton of questions on. First, just on Mobility pricing and ability to drive growth. Where do you think you are on that, mostly for UberX. And how do you see pricing in 2024 and do you see that maybe as a headwind for growth or any issues with that? And then second on insurance, can you just confirm, one month is in higher rates are in the March guidance and how you're thinking about maybe the step up in 2Q if anything we need to think about. Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. So I think in terms of Mobility pricing, Justin, Mobility pricing has been relatively flat on a year-on-year basis really for the full year this year. And kind of when you go back to pre-COVID levels, we're up now in the 20s, but compared to like a bunch of other products, we're probably I think the cost of Uber has increased similarly to many other products. So we actively work to make sure our supply position is in the right position. We actively work to make sure our own cost levers et cetera are getting more efficient, so that we can keep price at the prices that they are now. And drive the majority of our growth in terms of transactional growth. And you can see that on overall numbers, which is overall company growing transactions 24%, and gross bookings growing 21% on a constant currency basis. So we're actively looking to keep a lid on price, so to speak. And then what we're doing in terms of targeting different demographics is, there is a certain segment of folks who are willing to pay a premium for higher reliability or nicer cars and black or reserve. And then, of course, for the more cost-conscious consumer we're offering UberX share and some of the other products as well two-wheelers, or three-wheelers and in some of the developing countries. So we don't see price at this point as a factor that is restricting growth. And if anything you can see the growth the company continues to be very, very strong, we think growing faster than the category. And then on top of this base, of course, you have all of the new products that we're building, U4B and Hailables, et cetera. That portfolio is now at $11 billion run rate and it's growing 80% on a year-on-year basis. So we think the growth vectors that we've got in place are strong. And we look forward to continuing to grow the topline at very healthy levels this coming year, while Delivery margins at the same time. Prashanth, you want to talk insurance. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Not really, but I'll take that question. Yes, so as a reminder, maybe we'll say that -- remember, that we provide automotive liability insurance on behalf of our drivers. So it's a benefit we provide to them and in turn we build that in to our pricing. Certainly this is a Space that has been facing significant cost pressure, you're going to be seeing similar inputs from or outputs from both the personal and the commercial auto insurance companies. As a data point, we'd say -- we'd point you to the latest CPI Print, which had motor vehicle insurance up 20% year-over-year. So in this more inflationary environment, we are taking a number of steps to actively manage our cost. First, I'd call out that we can use the data that we have access to in the technology environment to really drive safety technology. And that includes things that we've talked about before, like reducing left turns, giving alerts to drivers when they are approaching challenging intersections, enabling both audio and video recording during trips so that there can be evidence of liability, which can be helpful to us. In addition, we have an excellent risk management program. We are -- we have a good partnership with our carriers, and we maintain these relationships over a longer-term. But what is helpful there as well is, we have our own captive insurance company. And that allows us to retain more risk, where necessary, particularly in harder insurance pricing markets when it could it be for a particular geography or locality. And then lastly on the regulatory side, we've got a really strong policy team that is working on a reform -- on reforms state-by-state. So we've seen some good progress, positive legislation in Florida, in Virginia and Georgia, working on some other states as well. And we're also active in a number of states, including California. You might have seen that -- you might have seen some activity on this in the last couple of weeks where we see an opportunity to really educate the new legislatures given there's a fairly high level of turnover, that's expected at the state level, 40 or so seats that are going to open up. And we've indicated that we're willing to put as much as $30 million into our Uber innovation pack, which is really focused on helping to identify business-friendly legislatures for the California State. Wrapping up at the kind of -- at the overall 2024 level, I would say that the insurance cost per trip for the US, that's certainly going to be a headwind. We've got these multiple cost mitigation efforts that we're going to continue to factor. And really, Justin, to your question, all of that is priced into the guide. So you should expect all that to be reflected in the outlook we're giving. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Yeah, thanks. Let me ask two questions, please. On the advertising revenue growth that's been better than maybe we all thought a year or two ago, what do you think have been the biggest kind of growth surprises. What parts of the -- all advertising platforms that you have done the best for you. And then in terms of Uber One, you got 19 million users. It's a really good number. I know it's a product that kind of like Prime over time can have more -- not more -- not just bells and whistles, but more really great features and functionality added to it. Can you just give a sense of what some of those new incremental features and functionality would be that consumers would really appreciate? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Absolutely. So, Mark, in terms of ads, we're very happy with the progress on ads. I'd say that we're not surprised, because we've got a terrific team, both on the sales side and the tech side. And they have been executing what they promised. Now the biggest area of strength on advertising are still the smaller businesses that advertise on our platform. These are your neighborhood restaurant who wants to get increase their business by 20% and puts in a certain dollar amount into the Uber ad system that we bid on for them. These advertisers on average are earning eight times their spend. We got about 550,000 businesses now advertising on our platform. It's up 75%. And that is the majority of our advertising revenue. And it's about bringing on more advertisers onto the platform or getting them to increase spend, if you're making eight times your investment, while increase your spend from $200 a week to $300 a week to $400 a week. That is absolutely something that we're focused on. And frankly, it's in the interest of our advertisers, based on the return on ad sales that they're seeing. Some of the faster growing areas of advertise -- of advertising are with enterprise clients and CPG clients. Enterprise advertisers, sometimes they look for additional bells and whistles they want -- they may want to target a certain demographic. They may want to target a certain daypart, for example, one of our big enterprise consumers wanted to target breakfast, as an example, or they may want to only bring on new customers who haven't eaten at that establishment before. So we're building out much more mature tool set for those kinds of advertisers more reporting on incrementality of the ad spend as well. And then for CPG companies, especially in the grocery part of our business, which is one of the fastest-growing segments of the business, we built out, for example, sponsored items for grocery. These CPGs, they are advertising in Albertsons, they are advertising in the grocery shelves at this -- right now. They advertise on Instacart. So essentially we're rebuilding those kinds of products to get them in front of an audience and Uber Eats audience, that's not only global, but it's growing very, very quickly. So any CPG advertisers who wants a growing audience and a global growing audience should get in front of our audience. And then, of course, there is our journey ads, which is advertising on mobile. These are people who are going out, who are impressionable, who may see kind of higher level branded, higher CPM brand advertising in the Uber app as well. That part of the business continues to grow, and that team had frankly a terrific Q4. When you look at membership, which we're very excited about, membership, really have a bit of sprint at the end of the year. We had kind of holiday promos on free trials. We moved a bunch of our Uber One members to annual memberships that reduces kind of the turnover or increases the retention of the members. So right now, I'd say, the focus of the team has been launching in more countries, we're in 25 countries, making sure that features like annual membership upsell that increased retention are available all over the world. Next year, you will see some bells and whistles, I would say, more on the Mobility front in terms of surprising and delighting the customer if it's an upsell or if you're, let's say, in an airport, but I want to save those surprises and delights [indiscernible] when we are ready to announce them, but stay tuned. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And maybe just to wrap it up, just put some numbers out there so that you have -- again, 19 million members across the 25 countries that Dara mentioned. And again, I want to go back to the data he pointed out earlier, about 45% of our Delivery gross bookings is coming from members. So it is definitely driving the frequency, which is elemental to the growth algorithm. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Next question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from Citi. Please go ahead. Ron Josey : Great, thanks for taking the question. Maybe two deeper dive, specific ones, Dara and Prashanth, I wanted to, maybe sticking with the Delivery side on grocery and retail. I think I saw gross bookings are now in a $7 billion run rate. Maybe Dara talk to us about the progress with grocery now that I think the infrastructure is built-out. And how you think about integrating grocery within delivery and food going forward? And given the conversations around frequency as a big opportunity to improve overall usage going forward, we'd love to again update on Uber teams, I think we saw that is now expanding to newer markets. But here in the States, talk to us about demand for Uber teams and sort of where that might go? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. As far as grocery and retail goes, we're very happy with the progress there. Like you said, $7 billion of gross bookings. And really the focus that we have now on grocery and retail is upsell to the Uber Eats customer. Our grocery and retail business is now fully native. We have sunset the Cornershop app all over the world. We certainly haven't sunset that team, that team is now actually leading many parts of our grocery and retail business. But the upsell is about showing at the right occasions grocery too and eat or so for example, after you've completed the order, maybe, you want a bottle of wine from a nearby liquor store or you want some dessert et cetera, it's those occasions that can introduce in a very natural way the Uber Eats customer to grocery and retail. And then what we'll look to do after that is promote, there is a supermarket around the corner, do you want to do a top-up shop or do you want to do your weekly shop on that supermarket as well. So, it\u2019s a lot of basic tackling, including getting more retailers onboard. And steadily we're increasing the number of eaters who also order grocery and retail, it's now up to 14%. And that is a percentage that you will continue to see move up throughout the year. So that's essentially what we're doing again, we expect big things from grocery and retail. Prashanth, do you want to talk about kind of the investment philosophy there. And then we'll go to Uber team. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, Ron, I think when we think about the unit economics for groceries, we feel pretty good about the direction we're headed, and how this will grow into a profitable business. A couple of the levers that we have access to is clearly the power of the platform allows us to have a efficiency at a fulfillment level, which is very hard for others to obtain, given the scale that we have and the carrier network that we've built out. In addition, with roughly 150 monthly users we can provide a very attractive platform to advertisers to come onto the platform, advertise for the grocery business, but also potentially have access to much broader set. So we feel-good that unit economics will get to a point where this is going to be a great business for us. I'll say that for 2024, while this business will not be in the black, it is going to be doing better than it was in 2023. So the trajectory is going in the right direction. And then, let's have Dara finish up on teams before we go to our last question. Dara Khosrowshahi : On teams, as a parent of team, I can tell you that Uber team has one of our all-time kind of favorite new product out there, obviously, the parent has to invite the team to use the product. We continue to expand in a number of markets. And one thing that's very interesting in terms of teen is that, we're actually seeing the frequency of use of teams, I guess it shouldn't be a surprise, be just as high as the frequency of adult. So, once teens get their hands on the product and is a very safe product, they use it every day to get around. And I think the reason why parents really love the product is, they are the ones that are inviting their teens to the product, they can rest assure that only the best drivers that are on the platform who have been there the longest, who have the best ratings can pick up a teen, there is automatic pin dispatch to make sure that you -- your teen gets in the right car, that sometimes is a worry. You can track your teen automatically to make sure when they get picked up, know when they get dropped off. And you as a parent can directly contact that driver, just in case you have any questions that the car stops and you're worried about et cetera. So the out-of-the-box tech that comes with teen, which is really an amalgamation of a number of safety innovations that we've led on in the industry, make it a product that has been an absolute hit. And I think we're pretty comfortable that once those teens turn into grownups, Uber is going to be their first choice for Mobility. So this is a product that today is a product that is looking great in terms of frequency and customer satisfaction. But it's also a product that's designed to -- for growth, not just today, but tomorrow. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Deepak Mathivanan : Great, thanks for taking the question. Dara, upfront fares has been live in the US for a few quarters now and has definitely been a huge factor in 2023. Can you talk about the opportunities to expand this into more international markets and also perhaps integrate it with a wider range of Mobility products beyond UberX in 2024. And then just a follow-up on the grocery side. What are some of the key product initiatives for 2024 for building out the grocery vertical. And do you see opportunities to accelerate product build out and maybe even retail partnerships through acquisitions? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, so in terms of upfront fares, we're very pleased with the roll out of upfront fares in the US and a number of other markets. And I'll remind our investors to that, we actually originally rolled out upfront fares on the delivery side of the business. So delivery was built out upfront fares in terms of couriers, knowing where they're picking-up, dropping off, or what the fair was going to be, based on the knowledge there and kind of working on that product, we've determined that this is a product that could work for mobility as well, because the number one issue that drivers were asking for is, I want to know where my destination is which wasn't available. So it's just an example of the power of the platform there, which is something that we do on the delivery side and innovate on the delivery side, finds its way on the mobility side. And again, we were the first in the US to debut upfront fares. And drivers absolutely love that, the destination information that they're getting. I'd say on upfront fares, actually we're less focused on launching it globally as we are on tuning the product itself. What you observe in terms of upfront fares, now that drivers know where they're going, and whether they're accepting some trips or not accepting some trips, is understanding that drivers are quite idiosyncratic in terms of their desire, there are some drivers who want long-trip, some that want short trips, some that want to go to airport, some that don't want to go the suburbs et cetera. So I think that what we can do better is actually targeting of different trips to different drivers based on their preferences or based on behavioral patterns that they're showing us, that really is the focus going forward, offering the right trip at the right price to the right driver, which is a win-win-win, the rider wait time is lower, drivers are seeing the trips that they want at the right price and the network gets more and more efficient. And I would also say that the nature of upfront fares, you've gone from just flat time and distance to now kind of point estimates for every single trip based on the driver. It accrues to players who have the kind of data skills and the amount of data that we have. We have more of these point estimates, we make more of those point estimates, than anyone else. We're making these point estimates both in mobility and delivery. We're doing it globally. So all things being equal, our AI algorithms are going to be able to learn more and are going to be able to be more accurate than anyone else's which is an advantage that over a period of time is absolutely going to accrue to us. In terms of grocery, new product initiatives, it again -- I think the focus for us is actually continuing to build out our merchant base. We continue to sign up new merchants all over the world. Some of the wins in the US for big loss and Sprouts Farm -- Sprouts Farmers market, Eataly as well. So, one is just driving the choice in the marketplace, and then I do think in terms of our catalog one of the areas that we're quite focused on is making sure that the catalog is mature and searchable. And when you search for chocolate milk, you get exactly what you're looking for. And I do think that the searchability of the catalog and a lot of the basics that we have in Grocery can get better and better. We're very excited about the potential there. And as we continue to add on more merchants all over the world, we think this business will continue to grow and eventually get to profitability. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn it back to management for closing remarks. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Krista. So thank you all for joining us today. As we wrap up the Q&A, I did want to share a quick organizational announcement. As part of career development for the exceptional finance talent here at Uber, Alex Wang, who has done an incredible job leading IR will be expanding his scope to include some FP&A responsibilities in addition to his role in IR. And I'm delighted to announce that Deepa Subramanian, the former CFO of our Delivery business will be expanding her scope to be the VP of IR and Corporate Finance. This will be a gradual transition, but I wanted to let you know that you'll be working with both of them in the coming quarters. So please join me in congratulating them both. And we appreciate your time. Look forward to talking to all of you again next week. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Uber Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call.  [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Deepa Subramanian, VP of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. You may begin. Deepa Subramanian : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation. On the call today, we have Uber's CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi; and CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah.  During today's call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, are included in the press release, supplemental slides and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com. Certain statements in this presentation and on this call are forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.

For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today as well as the risks and uncertainties described in our most recent Form 10-K and in other filings made with the SEC.  We published our quarterly earnings press release, prepared remarks and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website earlier today and we ask you to review those documents, if you haven't already. We will open the call to questions following brief opening remarks from Dara. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Deepa. Our results this quarter once again demonstrate our ability to deliver consistent, profitable growth at scale. Uber is off to a solid start in 2024 with trips up 21% year-on-year, consistent with our gross bookings growth rate on a constant currency basis. Our audience expanded by 15%, while frequency grew 6%, underpinned by 7.1 million drivers and couriers on our platform. At the same time, record adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion grew 82% year-over-year, and we generated $4.2 billion of free cash flow over the last trailing -- over the trailing 12 months.  We're making good progress on many of the initiatives we laid out for 2024 in our last earnings call. Demand for Uber remains strong. And just last week, we hit another best week ever for gross bookings, and we expect to deliver another quarter of over 20% year-on-year growth on a constant currency basis in Q2. With that, operator, can you open up for questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Justin Post : I guess, Dara, a lot of press on Tesla and robotaxi efforts lately. How are you thinking about AV impact on Uber and potential for new competition? And then maybe, Prashanth, it looks like stable bookings growth outlook in the low 20s in the second quarter, excluding FX. Anything to call out on headwinds or tailwinds? And any changes to your outlook, mid- to high teens growth, as you think about bookings in the second quarter? Dara Khosrowshahi : Prashanth, you want to talk to the second question first... Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, why don't I -- let me get that one out of the way, Justin, and thank you for the question. So just a recap for how we'd like folks to think about our gross bookings. Remember, the growth algorithm is audience, which is a measure of how many users of the product; frequency, how often are they using the product; and then, of course, pricing. Dara just mentioned that for the first quarter, we had very strong audience growth, up 15%. Great growth in frequency as well, up 6%. And pricing relatively flattish. So we see similar trends expected for the second quarter, and that's what's implied in the guide in terms of the composition of that growth algorithm. Demand for the products remains strong. I think we're expecting another quarter of pretty consistent scaled top line growth of over 20%. Actually, if you think of the guide that we gave for Q2, it's almost identical, both at the midpoint and at the range to what you gave -- what we gave for Q1. So very consistent performance, and we're exactly where we want to be with respect to the 3-year CAGR outlook that we gave you in February. Maybe just a little bit of color on the Q2 guide. We included in the press release some notes on FX headwinds. So we want -- I did want to call that out. We've got about 5 percentage points of headwind to Mobility's year-over-year gross booking growth, primarily coming from the Argentine peso. So said another way, we still expect Mobility to grow in the mid-20s range at a constant currency basis. I'll also highlight that in the prepared remarks, I made a comment about this, we expect Mobility's adjusted EBITDA margins to be down slightly quarter-over-quarter given that we did hold back some investments in Q1 and we would not do the same here for Q2. So with that, let me pass to Dara, and he can take the AV question. Dara Khosrowshahi : Justin, in terms of AVs and our strategy, it really remains the same. First thing I would say is that we think that the AV technology at maturity is going to be very good for the industry. It will be great for Uber. It holds a promise of safer rides. It holds a promise of expanding the marketplace by lowering prices and making mobility, delivery available for a wider swath of the population. And usually, when we see kind of lower prices for any service, you see higher adoption for a service, and that really is the promise of AV.  At the same time, we think that the technology is going to take a lot of time to develop. Obviously, there has to be a regulatory framework to put in place. And as the technology develops, we think that actually you're not going to make a jump from one tech -- human drivers fully to AV. There's going to be a relatively long period, a transition period that happens. Where for example, on Uber, you see it now, you have a combination of human drivers during -- human drivers fulfilling certain rides or deliveries or even loads on the trucking side along with AVs as well. And over period of time, you'll see kind of the penetration of AVs increase. I think it's very difficult to predict that period of time. But really, what we bring is the systems that we put in place, the pricing, matching, routing algorithms, the payments systems that we have on a global basis as well as the demand that we bring that enables us to partner with these AV providers to really drive utilization of their assets, this is very expensive tech that's been developed over a long time. And if you're an AV fleet owner or you are an individual owner of a car, whether that's a Tesla or another kind of car, you're just going to make more money and make a higher kind of return on your investment if you plug in your AVs into the Uber ecosystem and into Uber demand.  So we think we bring lots to the table. We're looking to partner with the AV industry. I do think that there's a good amount of excitement over some of the newer technologies and kind of the imitation models that we see in terms of AV. And you see that promise with Tesla's FSD. It looks like a great product. And also, you see that same promise in a lot of smaller players, whether that's a Wayve in the U.K. who got funded for $1 billion, a Waabi that, for example, we have investments in, these imitation learning models have a lot of promise over kind of the more classic heuristic-based development that you saw with AV.  And we think it's going to allow more players into the marketplace. We think it's going to reduce the amount of capital required to develop these systems over a long period of time. And we're looking to partner with big players and small players. And again, as this technology develops, we think we will be a big partner in it, and we think, ultimately, it will benefit AV players and it will benefit ourselves and riders and eaters as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have 2. The first one, Prashanth, I want to go back to that -- the comment in the prepared remarks that you just referenced about intentionally holding back some investments with lower ROI. Can you just sort of help us unpack it a little bit? What areas of investments did you hold back on? And sort of how do we think about the driver-versus-rider incentives or investment strategies as you go throughout the course of the year to drive durable growth? Then the second one, sort of wanted to hone in a little bit on Latin America. There's been some comments from one of your competitors in Latin America about potentially pulling back investment there. One, I'd be curious to hear about your -- what you're seeing in Latin America. And just remind us, what was the base case outlook for Latin America in the Analyst Day guidance that we got in February? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, Brian. Let me start then. So maybe as a reminder, when we think about investments on a quarterly basis across the market, we think about investments as what do we need to do to encourage drivers and couriers to come on to the platform, what can we do to be helpful to bring merchants to the platform. And then lastly, what can we do to encourage consumers. So we rotate among those 3 on a quarterly basis based on what we are trying to drive in the different markets in which we operate.  For the first quarter in Mobility, because of the seasonality trends in the first quarter, the return we get on some of those investment dollars tends to be lower than we see later in the quarter just because of seasonal patterns. And because that ROI is lower, it didn't make sense for us put as much into the first quarter as we would in other quarters. So you'll see us ramp that back up in 2Q. We called it out purely to keep folks from running too far ahead with enthusiasm on Mobility margin improvement. We are very confident that Mobility is still on a great trend for continuous margin improvement. But just from a timing standpoint, we didn't want to -- we wanted to acknowledge some of the lumpiness that you are likely to see. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. And I think in terms of Latin America and the competitive environment there, first thing I'd say, I'm assuming you're asking about Mobility, we're seeing very healthy Mobility volume growth in Latin America, in mid-20s. So we like the market, and we certainly like the volumes that we're seeing there. I would say that while -- I think you're referring to DiDi, they signaled a bit more capital discipline, we're not seeing that as of yet. We see DiDi being highly competitive in the marketplace and spending into the marketplace quite aggressively. Listen, it could be temporary. It might be driven by their desire to show international growth as the China markets have slowed down a bit as the prep for the IPO, but it's difficult for us to speculate on that.  And I'd say, we've seen this behavior before, Brian. And we have a very strong record of effectively responding to defend our category position when our competitors spend up and we do the same thing, and typically, we're much more efficient than our competition in terms of financial efficiency, network efficiency, et cetera. But at this point, we see DiDi leaning in, certainly not leaning out. And we are leaning in as a response, just like we do with other competitors all around the world. The good news for us is we have a very strong P&L, you see our margins continue to increase, so we have lots of pockets of investments to reach into, but we are going to be aggressive. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Brian, just to shout out for the note last week, I thought that was nice. And we're very much aligned with the more public participants in this market, the better it is for everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Douglas Anmuth : I just wanted to go back to the decel that you saw in monthly trips for MAPC in 1Q. Just hoping you could unpack that a little bit in terms of LatAm and some of the holiday impact there and what that means in 2Q.  And then, Dara, can you just talk more about your Delivery strategy in the suburbs, the key levers to success there? And then how you think the Instacart partnership fits in as well? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Let me take the first part of that. So again, the Mobility gross bookings growth for the first quarter was -- on a constant currency basis was 26%. Included in that 26% is about 1 point, whether you look at it sequentially or on a year-over-year basis, that came from us deconsolidating the non-ridesharing portion of our Careem business in December. Remember that used to be included in Mobility's results. And when we split that out, you have it in the compares, but you don't have it in Q1. So that's roughly about 1 point.  And then from a more seasonal impact, we'd call out 2 items. First, in Latin America, last year, we saw stronger demand in Brazil around Carnival that we did not see recur in Q1 of this year. And then from a timing standpoint, both Easter and Ramadan shifted on us between the quarters. So again, on a comp basis, that creates some lumpiness. But overall, I would say that we are very much -- remain confident on the growth of the Mobility business. Again, mid-20s year-over-year at constant currency for Q2. Sort of very consistent with what was done in Q1. And the -- as we mentioned in Dara's opening remarks, audience and frequency are both strong at the overall Uber level and remain very strong at the individual LOB levels. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. And Doug, in terms of our suburban strategy for Eats, it's very similar to our general strategy for our Delivery business on a global basis. We're very happy about our growth rates here, 17% constant currency growth rates for the second quarter in a row. Our U.S. growth rates are higher than that -- our U.S. and Canada growth rates are actually higher than that, which we're quite happy about. And generally, we are growing faster in the suburbs than we are in urban destinations, where we have higher penetration.  And it's about getting the basics right. Building an audience and a brand, increasing selection, making sure we've got pricing right and making sure the quality of the service continues to be high. And really with the Instacart deal that we have, represents the addition of a very high-quality and highly targeted audience, suburban audience, to the Uber Eats ecosystems and to our merchants. And we think that additional demand from this high-end consumer is going to be welcomed by our merchants. And at the same time, we continue to increase, for example, penetration with Domino's and a bunch of other merchants in the suburbs. So we think that we're well positioned to continue to grow into the suburbs, and we definitely think that the Instacart deal puts us in a better position for growth going forward in the suburbs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : Maybe a 2-parter on Uber One. Would love to learn anything that you've sort of continued to evolve and develop with respect to Uber One internationally as some of those markets have rolled out and they've begun to scale the longer Uber One has been available in some of the more overseas markets? And second, you have the call out in the prepared remarks around the subscription revenue run rate, what do you see as some of the biggest white spaces to drive more subscription revenue, but also continue to add more value and depth to Uber One at the subscription layer in terms of incentivizing adoption? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Before Dara jumps into that, I just want to remind everyone on what the -- is being referred to. We announced in the prepared remarks that our Uber One membership fees are now in excess of $1 billion. So that's a -- that's the first time we've called that out, but it's a big waypoint for us on our way to continue driving that. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, Eric, in terms of our strategy for Uber One internationally, it's largely the same as our strategy domestically and globally. It's a global product. We see penetration of Uber One consistently increasing in the U.S., Canada and internationally. Members are now generating 32% of Mobility and Delivery gross bookings, which are nicely up year-over-year. It's over 45% in Delivery gross bookings, where generally kind of were -- more highly penetrated. And I'll remind folks that members spend 3.4x as much as nonmembers per month. So it is a great vehicle for us to drive adoption and drive really attachment with our various services as well.  We are kind of working on a bunch of pretty exciting new initiatives. One that I would call out is continuing to optimize on the use of Uber Cash on the Mobility side. On Delivery, you get a discount on -- you don't have a delivery fee, you get a discount on your food often. With Mobility, you get back Uber Cash. And actually, 25% of Uber Cash earned on Mobility in the U.S., for example, is being redeemed on Delivery, and that's up from the mid-teens when we originally rolled out the benefit. Business riders also get Uber Cash, which is pretty cool. And we're seeing over 60% of the Uber Cash that's earned on Mobility actually redeemed on Delivery as well.  So we think that membership is a powerful lever in terms of general penetration into our marketplace and the frequency growth that we're seeing, but it's also a great lever in terms of using Uber Cash and introducing more of our users to the Delivery benefit as well. In terms of Mobility, we do think that we can penetrate more deeply into Mobility and like we're now introducing cash-back accelerators, where you can increase the cash-back amount for any product to the extent that we're trying to drive a product or quest that encourage users to use more premium products as well but carry higher margins for us.  You will see more member exclusives coming up where members have exclusive access to events and experiences, which will kind of surprise and delight our members. And then lastly, I would say that we are now moving more of our members on a global basis to annual pass. Annual pass actually results in significantly higher retention rates. So we'll cut the -- our members are able to save money, so to speak, and we see it in the retention benefits. And that has resulted in retention increasing nearly 200 basis points on a year-on-year basis in March, for example.  So there's a lot going on. We think we are -- there's a ton of white space as it relates to our membership product. We're very pleased with $1 billion in revenue, but we think that there's a lot more growth there in membership generally and in terms of membership revenue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Nikhil Devnani : Dara, I wanted to ask about U.S. rideshare growth. First, is it keeping pace with your mid-20s growth overall for the business? And then second, can you talk a bit more about where the growth is coming from? Obviously, the service is not new anymore. So it feels like it's more frequency led but is there still a healthy supply -- or healthy funnel, sorry, of new customer acquisition that you're still finding maybe it's suburbs or smaller cities or new demos, however you want to frame it. But just your overall thoughts on how this growth sustains would be very helpful. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. See, in terms of U.S. Mobility growth, we don't disclose U.S. versus non-U.S. But obviously, by the overall numbers that you see in terms of our Mobility growth, 26% on a year-on-year basis compared to 28% last quarter and 100 basis points of kind of slowdown was because of Careem on a comparable basis. These are very, very high growth rates, and the U.S. is our largest market in terms of gross bookings. So we wouldn't be able to grow at these rates, so to speak, without the U.S. growth being very, very healthy.  In terms of where Mobility growth is coming from, I'd say the significant -- the most significant part of growth is coming from audience. Our MAPC growth in Mobility was up 17% on a year-on-year basis, overall, 15%. So the audience growth for Mobility is actually growing faster. And one particular area of growth that we're seeing is our new products. When you look at our Hailables product, U4B, our new Health business, Reserve, UberX Share, all of these products, kind of our new growth bets, are growing 80% year-on-year. But at the same time, over 20% of our new customers are coming from this new product category as well. So it's a good business. It's growing very, very quickly, but it's also introducing a whole new audience into our marketplace.  Last thing that I would add is that with the pandemic, I think a lot of people who were kind of commuting to work, et cetera, stopped commuting. We have lost some of our most frequent customers. We see the weekday commute use case being particularly strong as people are coming back to work. Some folks may not like that, but we love it here at Uber, people getting back to work and getting back to the office. So there is an audience who kind of stopped using us as frequently as they used to. We were kind of a daily habit. And hopefully, we will see that audience come back, and we're seeing evidence of that in terms of the weekday volumes being super strong. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : Great. The prepared remarks flagged a bunch of new features in the advertising business, enterprise features. So can you guys give us an update on where we are with the non-restaurant advertising as a percentage of just the total advertising ARR? And then somewhat related, with the new Instacart partnership, can we sell advertising against that engagement? And I guess just how does the Instacart partnership change your own -- your kind of O&O efforts in U.S. grocery? And how are the unit economics going to work in this partnership? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Ross, it's Prashanth. Let me start just with a couple of data points and then hand off to Dara. First, as a reminder to everyone, we hit a $900 million run rate for advertising in Q4 of 2023. We do not break that down between Delivery and Mobility.  And then on the Instacart arrangement, as Dara had mentioned and we discussed yesterday, when folks click through Instacart and they come to the Uber Eats WebView app, that was -- our ads and those are our -- that's our space to use and monetize. So with that, let me pass off to Dara to make some more comments. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. In terms of the non-restaurant advertising, listen, it's still really in nascent stages. So we talked about restaurant advertising getting to 2% of gross bookings. We actually think that our sponsored items, product, for example, grocery, can get the higher percentages of that. Instacart, for example, we think, is in the mid-2s in terms of advertising as a percentage of gross bookings. And we fully launched out our sponsored items in the U.S. and Canada, and now we're scaling it in 8 additional priority markets in 2024.  So I'd say like sponsored items is where we were in sponsored listings for restaurants 3 years ago. We gave you a very clear growth map to $1 billion in terms of revenue, and we're going to beat that this year. And we're quite confident we can start moving in a similar direction as it relates to nonrestaurant-sponsored items in the grocery space. We're already active with about 500 top CPG brands, and we're seeing very strong retention as we expand. And really, it's going to be about the growth of the underlying grocery platform. As we increase grocery audience -- this last quarter about 15% of our monthly actives on Eats bought from grocery. That's up nicely on a year-on-year basis. As that audience increases, we think we can monetize that audience with the base business. But with advertising just as we've done with restaurants, and we think it's -- it can be an enormous opportunity, and it can be a high-margin opportunity as well. I would also point out that we're quite bullish on a rider ads. We're seeing very strong engagement from riders, a click-through rate of about 2.5%, more than 2.5% compared to an industry average of less than 1%. So video ads and tablets continue to be a very promising growth area for us, and we're quite happy to see the progress there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Mark Stephen Mahaney : Two questions, please. I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about delivery, MAPC growth accelerating in markets like the U.S. Can you go into the -- why MAPC growth accelerated for you? And then secondly, in Delivery, grocery and retail delivery, can you talk about what impact that's having on segment margins or what the unit economics are there -- are like there? Or yes, how much of a drag or when do you see a path to profitability? And maybe it's already there for those 2 segments, but just talk about the impact of those 2 segments on the Delivery's overall profitability. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, Mark. So in terms of delivery growth and audience growth, this has been pretty consistent, right? We've accelerated the growth rate of our Delivery business. It was growing closer to 10% early last year. It's now growing in the teens. And we think the nature of that growth is improving as well, which is most of the growth last year was on price. Now actually, price is a relatively small portion of the growth, and audience and frequency are the largest portion of the growth in Delivery. And it is about just getting the basics right. It's about having a great service, having a significant selection, or selections. Active merchants is up 12% on a year-on-year basis.  It's about improving pricing. So for example, merchant-funded promos, these are -- merchants put in promos, pricing promos into the marketplace in order to drive volumes. Those are up 100 basis points on a year-on-year basis. Again, lowering effective price to the consumer. And then it's about quality. We continue to improve our defect rates. All that adds up to higher frequency, higher retention of audience. And we continue to spend aggressively in terms of marketing our brand. We think the Uber Eats brand is a top brand out there. And then on top of that, of course, we've got the unique platform benefits of our Mobility business that continues to grow audience, throwing over some of that audience to our Delivery business.  So this is all part of the formula that we have in this journey that we've been on over the past couple of years. We're able to do so while we're increasing margins because of the efficiency that we are getting in our marketplace, because of the efficiency, the kind of structural benefits that the platform brings, and we see no signs of that slowing down. Prashanth, do you want to talk about grocery, retail? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. I'll take the last part of that. So we remain very positive on grocery and retail. The business growth remains quite strong. GBs are up about 40% on a constant currency basis. Once again, 40%, so very strong top line there. And despite that very strong growth, we were still able to expand our Delivery EBITDA margins by about 20% sequentially, and that was partly contributed to by improvement in the profitability of the grocery business. So it is still not where we want it to be. It's still not at a positive EBITDA margin, but it is improving both year-over-year and sequentially, and we feel very good about the path we have to getting to profitability on grocery.  It's going to come from a couple of items. First, the power of the platform, which we refer to quite frequently here. About 15% of our Delivery users are ordering on -- are ordering groceries, and that's up set from where we left Q4. Continuing to see opportunities on ads, which are great margin accretive for us as we bring those CPG players into the platform for grocery advertising. Being able to lower some of the consumer promotions we have. So overall, a number of different drivers. And we think that grocery will eventually be a very strong part of the overall portfolio.  With that, I think we have time for our final question, operator. So if we could go to that. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. James Lee : Two here on Delivery. Can you guys give us an update on maybe the European gig economy regulation, maybe what policy we should pay attention to, and how should we think about implication of labor costs? And maybe on the U.S. side, can we get a sense of the impact of minimum wage in Seattle and New York on GB and EBITDA? And how do you guys plan to mitigate impact going forward? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. As far as the EU platform work directive, EU lawmakers essentially voted to maintain a status quo there, with platform worker status continuing to be decided on a country-by-country basis. Member states have until mid-2026 to implement that. And we think that the deal is really unlikely to bring major changes to the current situation in the vast majority of EU countries. And for us, our view remains the same, which is we believe that we should bring kind of the flexibility that gig works brings to couriers, to drivers in the marketplace, along with certain protections that we kind of talk to and have discussions with on a local basis. So we really don't see any changes coming in terms of the EU. In terms of the -- Seattle and New York, I think some of the regulation that we've seen has actually been very unpopular with couriers, restaurants and customers. So for example, we saw in Seattle, which is a relatively small market for us, Delivery order volumes decreasing by 45%, which has resulted in courier wait time actually increasing 50% on a year-on-year basis. So couriers may be making more per order, but they're getting a lot less orders, which has resulted in 30% of active couriers actually leaving the platform, which I think is certainly not what the City Council had in mind.  So we're actually seeing the City Council in Seattle, for example, bring forward a reform in Seattle to make the standard lower and much more viable for the platforms. We're not there yet. But there's a vote coming up in -- I think it's actually tomorrow, and we think we'll have a positive outcome there. And it's important that it's a positive outcome for couriers and restaurants and customers, because certainly, the Seattle -- the regulation that has been in place in Seattle has clearly been poor regulation that has hurt the people that they're supposed to protect.  We'll see what happens in New York City. Unfortunately, again, in New York City, we have had to essentially slot couriers, and we've got a waitlist of over 20,000 couriers who want to be on the platform. But because of that regulation, we've had to reduce the number of couriers on the platform by close to 25% since the standard went in place. So less people get to earn in New York, we don't think that's a good thing.  Now again, we have been able to absorb the financial hit of all these different regulations in our platform. You've seen in our profitability, which is up over 80% in Uber Eats on a year-on-year basis. So we're a big company. We have a lot of markets. We're quite diversified. Our technology continues to drive a more effective marketplace that allows us to absorb these regulations. But I think couriers in New York City who want to work, couriers in Seattle who want to work, they're getting hit hard by these regulations, and we're hoping that kind of regulators see the right path going forward because, so far, regulation has definitely hurt the people that it's supposed to protect. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Okay. Before Dara wraps it up, I wanted to remind everyone next week is our annual Uber GO-GET. This is our event which showcases new products and features across both the Mobility and Delivery. Obviously, we're not going to get ahead of the announcements, but our theme is togetherness. And in addition to the product piece, we've got a great fireside chat with Dara and Maria Shriver. This will be in New York. So if any of you are looking to get out of the office, please reach out to Deepa and we can see what space we have. If you do join us, my only request is you travel by Uber. And with that, let me have Dara wrap it up. Dara Khosrowshahi : I like it. My CFO is upselling. And thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call, and a huge thank you for the Uber teams. There's a ton of work that goes into all of the new products that we're launching, into the products that we'll be talking about in GO-GET, and into delivering the kind of growth and profitability that we've seen from Uber over the past couple of years. So a big thank you for the team for continuing to deliver this quarter. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, everyone. Talk to you next quarter. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, please press star, one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to turn the conference over to Deepa Subramanian, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead. Deepa Subramanian : Thank you Operator. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber\u2019s second quarter 2024 earnings presentation. On the call today, we have Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, and CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. During today\u2019s call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are included in the press release, supplemental slides, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com. Certain statements in this presentation and on this call are forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements we make today, except as required by law. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today, as well as the risks and uncertainties described in our most recent Form 10-K and in other filings made with the SEC. We published a quarterly earnings press release, prepared remarks, and supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website earlier today and we ask you to review those documents, if you haven\u2019t already. We will open the call to questions following brief opening remarks from Dara. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks Deepa. Q2 was another record quarter for Uber and further demonstrated our ability to deliver profitable growth at scale. Gross bookings grew 21% on a constant currency basis, consistent with trip growth. Our audience expanded 14% while frequency grew 6%, supported by 7.4 million drivers and couriers globally. At the same time, adjusted EBITDA grew 71% year-on-year and we generated record quarterly GAAP operating income. These are super strong results that we\u2019re proud of, but I also understand there are two big questions out there that I want to address before we head into Q&A. First, the strength of the consumer and how Uber will perform in a recession. Based on what we\u2019re seeing today, the Uber consumer is in great shape. Our audience is bigger than ever and using our services more frequently than ever. While our consumers tend to be higher income, we\u2019re not seeing any softness or trading down across any income cohort. Were the current macroeconomic fears to materialize, we\u2019re confident that Uber can perform well because of the countercyclical nature of our platform. On the mobility side, more driver supply brings down prices for riders and improves reliability, and on the delivery side, merchants are investing in performance channels like ours for growth, improving selection and affordability for consumers. In fact, in Q2 the number of first-time consumers on Uber Eats in the U.S. was higher than at any point over the past five quarters. It\u2019s clear that delivery is much more habitual than many assumed, made even more so by our Uber One membership, which now covers 50% of delivery gross bookings. We\u2019ll continue to drive consistent top line growth while expanding GAAP operating income. Our track record of making and then exceeding our commitments should give investors confidence that we\u2019ve built the capital discipline and operational muscle to perform well in any scenario. Second, autonomous - put simply, Uber is uniquely positioned to offer tremendous value for AV players looking to deploy their technology at scale. While the operation of a ride hail network may seem simple, our technology obscures a huge amount of complexity. We support roughly one million trips per hour and our average ETA globally is approximately four minutes. That\u2019s possible because of marketplace tech that makes over 10 million predictions per second, and more mundanely, we handled more than 25 million lost items in just last year alone. We also know that a key factor in AV commercialization will be asset utilization. AV players will need to ensure that their expensive assets are being used as close to 24 hours a day as possible while also managing the daily and weekly peaks and valleys of ride hail activity. Uber can provide enormous demand without AV players needing to invest capital towards acquiring customers or building the marketplace tech that delivers reliability at the standard that consumers have come to expect. That\u2019s all to say that Uber will be an indispensable partner for AV players of all sorts. We\u2019re in late stage discussions with additional global AV players to join our platform and will have more announcements in the coming weeks and months. Thanks to the Uber team for another great quarter. With that, Operator, let\u2019s open the call for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, the first one is on AV. Dara, I appreciate the color, and even the extra color in the press release. My question is, is there any more detail on what you\u2019re seeing in Arizona around incrementality of rides from the partnership? How do we think about sort of the relative unit economics, and philosophically, what is your strategy of reinvesting dollars to sort of drive more AV growth versus delivering profitability? Then the second one on mobility specifically, can you talk to us just a little bit on what you\u2019re seeing on mobility MAPC versus frequency growth drivers, just [indiscernible] or break apart what\u2019s driving that growth in the quarter for mobility? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure, absolutely Brian, thanks for the question. I don\u2019t want to speak specifically to Arizona because obviously we have Waymo as a partner there, and I want to hold confidentiality, etc. as any partner should. But when we look more broadly at our operations with the various AV players that we see, what we do see is that the utilization that these AV players are able to develop on our network is significantly higher than the utilization we believe that they\u2019re able to run out without [indiscernible] basis, so 3P utilization is significantly higher than 1P utilization. If you think about the role of the marketplace, the role of the marketplace is to drive utilization of fixed assets. I mean, in the end, it\u2019s why a McDonald\u2019s or a Starbucks or even Dominos now works with us - they have direct channels to consumers, but they also work through the marketplace to bring more demand to their stores, so to speak, and we think the same will be true of AV players, which is as long as we\u2019re able to drive higher utilization and the utilization that we drive, the incrementality we think significantly exceeds the take rate that we will charge on average for mobility. Not including insurance costs, our global take rate is around 20%, so you\u2019d have to drive 25% increasing utilization. We believe that those utilization numbers are possible and we think that we can exceed those kinds of utilization numbers. Right now, the economics and the math are definitely working. I think the additional benefit that we bring to these players is we have a dynamic dispatch model that can determine what are the pick-ups and drop-offs that an autonomous player can effectively play with - you know, the pick-up point is easy, it\u2019s within a block, same thing with the drop-off points, and then what are the circumstances when we should dispatch a human for a particular pick-up or a drop-off, if the route is complex or the pick-up or drop-off has some special circumstances. We\u2019re able to essentially allow autonomous players to dispatch in situations where we know that they will succeed, so all in all the early data is quite encouraging, and as I said, we\u2019ve had lots of discussions with other players out there. We don\u2019t think this will be a win or take all market, and we think that we will continue to have the most liquid and largest marketplace that will be--that will have humans and AV players as part of it during this pretty long hybrid period, as autonomous is development and regulators are trying to figure out exactly how to regulate it. Prashanth, do you want to take the second one? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I will, thanks Dara. I think, Brian, your question was on mobility growth, so maybe I\u2019ll start with just restating how we did for Q2 and our outlook for Q3. For Q2, the results that we printed, if you do it at a constant currency, very strong at 27% year-over-year growth. For Q3, we\u2019re looking for sort of a repeat in that mid-20s range, again on a constant currency basis. But when you dig into why do we have such confidence in the mobility business, I would take you back to the framework we talked about in February, that mobility over the three years that we gave you should be growing at the mid-teens or better, and that\u2019s coming from a couple items. On the user side, we still believe that we have a pretty massive TAM that we can go after. We\u2019re continuing to drive product innovation, and we talked about a couple of those at Go Get earlier this year, and we\u2019re continuing to find new demographics in areas to continue to expand in. Maybe one data point on TAM that I think is helpful for folks is our monthly penetration of consumers, and we define that as folks who are over 18 years, is less than 20% across our top 10 countries, so a lot of room to run there. Another key driver will be frequency, which I think folks understand to be how our monthly active--how many times our monthly actives engage with the platform. We are launching new products, continuing to improve reliability so that when you call for an Uber, we\u2019re able to get you one at a time that you\u2019re looking for, and of course the benefits of membership. Only about half of our riders take one to two trips per month, so again plenty of upside there to continue to drive this as a more frequent daily use case. Dara Khosrowshahi : Then Brian, I think you had asked about our strategy to reinvest to drive, let\u2019s say, AV growth versus profits. Generally we are able to lean into our newer products, so for example if you look at moto, which are two wheelers in Latin America and a number of developing countries, if you look at our shared product, UberX Share, where we get more than one passenger in a vehicle, or even taxis, those newer products are growing faster than the base business and their margins are substantially lower than the base business, but we\u2019re able to-- as we scale, we\u2019re able to leverage our cost base, our technology improvements in terms of targeting, in terms of CPT all allow us to have a profit envelope to be able to be reinvest into our newer products - AV is one of those new products, while overall increasing profit margins. This is something that we\u2019ve been doing for years, and we think AV will be part of the same equation. I don\u2019t--you know, AV is not something that we\u2019re going to look to make substantial profits from over the next five to 10 years, and that\u2019s just fine because we\u2019ll be able to build a lot of liquidity in the marketplace to continue on the path that we have been operating in over the past five years. Brian Nowak : Great, thank you both. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Thanks so much for taking the questions. Dara, can you just talk more about the importance of the BYD partnership as you bring new EVs into global markets, and then perhaps how that can tie into AV over time? Then Prashanth, just if you could talk more about the drivers of delivery profitability - good upside there in the quarter, and what gives you the confidence on the clear path to EBITDA profit in grocery and retail as well? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely Doug. I\u2019ll start with BYD. The electrification of our fleet is an incredibly important initiative for us. We are--if you look at Uber, Uber drivers are switching over to electric at five times the speed that normal drivers are, and if there\u2019s any driver that you want to switch over to EVs, it\u2019s an Uber driver because Uber drivers also drive around five times the miles of a regular driver as well, so it\u2019s a very targeted segment that we\u2019re going after and we\u2019re hoping that governments can help us go after as well. The number one reason why some drivers hesitate to move over to EVs is affordability, and the fact is that BYD, when you look at cost and quality, BYD is really second to none in terms of any manufacturer out there. We\u2019re very, very excited with the partnership. We are--we believe we\u2019re going to bring over 100,000 new BYD EVs onto the Uber platform across some of our most important global markets out there, and we\u2019ve always talked about climate being a team sport, we are going to be leaders in terms of climate change, and having BYD as a partner is just terrific to see. More recently, BYD has committed to very, very significant investments in the AV space, and judging from what they have accomplished in the EV space, I would not--I would make a bet on them in AV as well. But the investment that they\u2019re making in AV is in the billions and we\u2019re very much looking forward to partnering with them on both EVs and AVs. Prashanth? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, so I think your question was on delivery profitability. Although we don\u2019t--we don\u2019t want to draw attention to incremental margins, we did have a pretty terrific quarter for incremental margins in delivery - 10% for the second quarter, so putting a little context around that. We are clearly seeing the benefits of scale as it runs through the delivery business and we still have many levers that we\u2019re continuing to tune to drive that profitability in delivery. That includes some incredible tech that the team has built that continues to drive down the cost per transaction--cost per trip in terms of operational improvements. We\u2019ve got great improvements in advertising - I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that\u2019s now running in excess of a billion dollars on a run rate basis, and continuing to find ways, both operationally and with tech, to reduce some of our other costs like refunds and appeasements, which are still a bit of a drag on the delivery segment. You know, the fact that we were able to grow delivery profitability while continuing to have very strong growth in grocery really is a good indicator of how much strong growth we\u2019re seeing in that profitability. I think delivery EBITDA was up by 25 basis points sequentially, and that is despite grocery growing at a substantially faster rate than delivery. In grocery profitability, it\u2019s what we\u2019ve talked about in the past - you know, using the power of the platform, we can bring down the customer acquisition cost and drive those cost efficiencies. We\u2019ve got 15% of our Eats customers are now using grocery - that\u2019s up about 200 basis points year-over-year as of middle of the year, and we\u2019re seeing retention on grocery also improving. I mentioned the ads revenue, and then also starting--given that our selection\u2019s improving, we\u2019re also driving down consumer promotions and continuing to add more and more merchants onto the platform - we mentioned Costco, and I think in the press release or prepared remarks, we also mentioned a couple other grocers. All in all, things are on track to where we gave you in our three-year model, and grocery is continuing to be a strong story for our delivery business. Dara Khosrowshahi : Just one very encouraging trend on grocery and retail is that ad spend on grocery and retail has more than tripled on a year-on-year basis - obviously that\u2019s very high margin product, and we are continuing to expand our CPG product now into a bunch of new countries, so the momentum there is terrific to see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the questions. Maybe two, if I could, coming back to the delivery business. Building on the last set of comments, how do you think about the potential longer term for increased utility, increased frequency as you layer more supply into the delivery network, and what you continue to learn about the relationship of evolving the experience for consumers and what it means for platform growth over a longer period of time? Then also on the delivery side, we\u2019ve seen a lot of market consolidation and market rationalization in some of the countries around the globe. How do you think about the asset portfolio on delivery and your current marketing positioning against some of those industry dynamics you\u2019re seeing on the capital side? Thanks so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes Eric, so what we\u2019re seeing in terms of delivery is the long term growth is incredibly promising, and especially our ability to expand into the adjacent category of grocery and retail. The grocery and retail TAM is actually bigger than the online food delivery TAM, so not only do we believe we\u2019ve got a long runway in online food delivery but we\u2019re just getting started as it relates to grocery and retail. We now have 1.1 million merchants on the platform - that\u2019s up 13%. Our merchant penetration in most countries still is very low, well under 50%, and every time we add a merchant, because we have more diversity of choice, average conversion tends to improve for consumers who are kind of searching for their favorite restaurant or favorite dessert place, and each merchant gives us actually another item to market against as it relates to search engine optimization or search engine marketing in third party channels as well. So new merchants add conversion, choice, and actually are another item to market against, and we\u2019re a very, very long way in terms of full merchant penetration in the marketplace. It all results in either retention being up globally in every single mega region just in June on a year-on-year basis, so right now we believe there\u2019s a very, very long runway for growth. The more consumers use our products in a multi-product way, whether it\u2019s a mobility user using delivery or a delivery user buying from grocery and retail, the more they transact on the platform, multi-product consumers spend three times more than single product consumers, and for us, the more products we add to the marketplace, the more this benefit adds onto it, and then on top of that, you add our membership product as well, which is now over 50% of bookings. The volumes are strong, we are not having to buy our way into strong volumes, we\u2019re kind of earning our way into strong volumes, and I think the fundamentals are going to be there for some time to come. In terms of our portfolio, we had made the strategic decision a few years ago, probably three or four years ago to exit markets that we didn\u2019t think we could either be the number one or number two, and if we\u2019re the number two, the ability to move to a number one position. We\u2019ve gained category position in delivery in every one of our top 10 markets on a year-on-year basis. It\u2019s a function of the great execution of our operations team, the technology that we\u2019re shipping, and then the power of the platform. There\u2019s no other global player who operates both in mobility and delivery or has as broad a platform as we do, so we\u2019re very happy with our portfolio, so to speak, and I think the results speak for themselves. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Eric, as someone who\u2019s been in the business coming up now on my one-year anniversary soon, I\u2019m surprised--I was surprised to learn how sticky the food delivery business is. It is very habitual, and we\u2019ve got great data that shows that stickiness is improving. I think I looked back at five, six quarters of data, and it gets better every quarter in terms of either retention, so there\u2019s clearly the trajectory to follow what we\u2019re seeing in mobility. Eric Sheridan : Appreciate it, thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Thank you. I wonder if you could revisit the consumer downturn scenario. What would you expect to happen for mobility if we do have a recession or a bigger downturn as far as maybe trade down or looking for lower priced rides, the impact on bookings and profitability? Then Prashanth, maybe you could talk about--it looks like you\u2019ve turned the corner on independent contract deals in Massachusetts and other areas. What happens to your cost when you sign those deals, and can you cover it with higher fees? What are the business model impacts of signing those deals? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes Justin, in terms of a consumer downturn scenario on mobility, we see these circumstances in a number of markets - LatAm has been through a bunch of cyclical trends, etc., and usually a downturn, the leading indicator of a downturn is a weak job market. We might be seeing it in some of the western markets, we might not - it\u2019s very difficult to tell, but when there is a weaker job market, typically our driver supply on the mobility side significantly improves. We\u2019re a very, very flexible work platform, average earnings per utilized hour for drivers in the U.S., for example, is $33 per utilized hour, so it\u2019s highly flexible and the earnings per utilized hour are strong. Typically what we see is improvement in driver supply. As driver supply improves, surge comes down, ETAs improve, the service itself becomes more compelling, and as a result volumes typically turn out to be quite sticky. In addition to those trends, we are actively investing in affordability, right - the membership program essentially brings prices down for both mobility and delivery, and we\u2019re investing in products such as two-wheelers and three-wheelers and UberX Share, all of whom provide discounts of, let\u2019s say, 25% to 50% of, let\u2019s say, the price of an UberX as well. We think that we can thrive in upturns and downturns, and I think that the team has proven that they have execution capability to be able to perform in any kind of market. Listen - we\u2019re watching trends very, very closely and I do believe we\u2019ll be able to adjust as needed. Prashanth, do you want to talk about Massachusetts? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, I will. Justin, maybe I\u2019ll also just start by reminding folks that we have three different broad models on how we go to market in our operating framework for folks. We have the traditional independent contractor, which is how most people think of Uber, and that is the model that the company was largely built on. Then over time, we\u2019ve adapted to now the IC-plus model, which is what you referred to for Massachusetts, and that\u2019s where we enter into agreements to provide some level of benefits, and then there are still some countries that we use a fleet model, where an independent company sort of handles the actual execution on the ground, and we serve as feeding them the global--or the in-country demand or the in-city demand. Specifically in Massachusetts, we reached a deal with the Attorney General that settled on a set of standards for earners that includes how we measure or how we define time on the platform, certain healthcare, family and medical leave benefits as well. As a consequence for that, the Attorney General dropped their action against Uber and we\u2019re no longer in pursuit of a ballot issue in Massachusetts, like we had very successfully done in California. The consequence of that is we will factor that into our operating model in Massachusetts, but as we\u2019ve said back in February at our investor day, we still have plenty of runway to focus on operational costs, so while this will be built into the cost structure that we push to the market, we continue to believe that there is plenty of runway ahead for us to continue to drive down our operating costs through the support costs and payments and a variety of other measures, that we continue to sort of grind out those basis points that will continue to make Uber an affordable option for all. Justin Post : Great, thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re welcome. Next question, Operator? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Your line is open. Nikhil Devnani : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Dara, I wanted to ask a two-parter on autonomous vehicles. First, can you help us understand how much of the ride share demand takes place during peak hours, in mornings and evenings? I would imagine that utilization math around the peak is really at the core of your value prop to partners. Then second, the partnership model makes a lot of sense to us for both sides, but there is a world where providers choose not to partner, they choose to compete more directly, so my second question is around, I guess, what the Plan B is for Uber in the event the leading players choose not to extend partnerships or engage in partnerships? How do you navigate that scenario? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. In terms of peak and trough, while we haven\u2019t disclosed the numbers, there are very, very significant peaks during rush hour both ways, obviously in the mornings and going home, during after-hours drinks, etc. We are able to shape demand and supply--actually, demand through surge when we need to, and supply, obviously positioning our drivers through incentives either on a temporal basis or on a geographic basis, if there\u2019s a concert going on, etc. The good news there is that through our incentive structure, essentially those are variable costs for us. We will pay more during those peak periods and then when we don\u2019t need supply, we can take incentives out, so we have a model where essentially we\u2019re able to shape supply to match demand in a variable basis. I think that in an AV world, the car is there at all times, so you kind of have to pay the overhead for the car and the amortization of the car during all periods, so we think kind of hybrid network that can--that consists of both humans and robots can handle the peaks and valleys much more effectively than a pure play network. In terms of AV partnerships, etc., I would tell you, Nikhil, that based on the conversations that we\u2019re having, we are highly, highly confident of being able to acquire AV content, if you want to call it that, on a global basis. The fact is this is not turning out to be a winner take all market - originally, I think that was the concept why Uber wanted to develop the technology itself, but every single OEM is investing in some L2 or L3 technology. If you look at some of the newer tech coming in terms of imitation learning technologies that have taken the imagination of folks through LOMs, that same technology, we believe can potentially introduce a new wave of AV through imitation learning at substantially lower capital costs that was necessary historically, so we think there are going to be many, many AV providers. If there are many, many AV providers, the marketplace--and our marketplace is by far the largest marketplace, global marketplace both for mobility, delivery, and then freight as well, the marketplace will have a very, very strong position. At this point, we don\u2019t see any signal that a Plan B will be necessary. Also, take note that we have investments, strategic investments in a number of AV players - Aurora, we\u2019re working with Waymo, for example, and there are other investments that we have in AV players to make sure that Plan A is the right plan going forward. So far, I\u2019d say so good, and as I mentioned in my remarks, we will have more partnerships to announce in the next weeks and months, and I think the market will see--you\u2019ll see that Plan B isn\u2019t necessary. Nikhil Devnani : Thanks Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : You\u2019re very welcome. Next question, Operator? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Colatuoni with Jefferies. Your line is open. John Colatuoni : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Given the continued progress on mobility frequency, I was curious if we could go back to some disclosure you provided about a year ago, showing pre-COVID cohorts in the U.S. and Canada had lower frequency than more recent cohorts. How has mobility usage progressed across cohorts over the past year, and what does that progression tell you about the opportunity to keep driving frequency higher through multi-product adoption? Second, the $1 billion in advertising run rate suggests over 50% growth, which is really strong but a bit of a deceleration from more like 80% exiting last year. Talk about how restaurants are balancing investments in sponsored listings versus merchant-funded offerings, which you mentioned grew over 70% year-on-year in the quarter. Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : John, in terms of mobility frequency, while we\u2019re not going to disclose specifically what frequency looks like, I would say that when we look at lower cost products, when you look at UberX Share, hailables, two-wheelers, three-wheelers, the frequency of some of the newer products is significantly higher than the frequency of, call it the X product, etc. When you look at the overall frequency numbers for both mobility and delivery, they\u2019re up on a year-on-year basis. It is absolutely helped by multi-product usage, it is absolutely helped by membership as well, so whether you look at cohorts, whether you look at new customers, high income, low income, the frequency numbers for us in both mobility and delivery are very, very constructive. You want to talk about ads, Prashanth? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sure. I think the question--your question, John, again was on merchant-funded offers, or offers in general, how are we seeing that have an impact for the business. I would tell you to think about it in two elements. First, as we\u2019re able to drive, and we see very strong cooperation from merchants in using merchant-funded offers to drive their demand, it is actually being a very helpful way for them to address their need, to attack the affordability question that folks are asking, so that can come through a variety of different things that they\u2019re putting onto the platform - it could be a buy one, get one, it could be if you spend a certain amount, you get a certain percentage off. We\u2019re seeing extremely strong growth in the use of merchant-funded offers and the tech that we have is allowing them to be quite creative in how they want to apply that and when. I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s quite unique to us, and as a result of that, we are seeing very good support of their business growth. In a time when I think there is more macro concerns around what\u2019s happening with some of the large enterprise customers, we are seeing our SMBs really lean in more and are seeing strong growth in this. I\u2019d also say that when we look at the category levels that folks are shopping at on the merchant side, we\u2019re continuing to see folks shopping at what we would have categorized as a more expensive or, I think it\u2019s a two dollar sign category versus the single dollar sign, so we\u2019re again seeing folks not trading down at SMBs because some of that is being supported by the RFO or the restaurant-funded offers that we are enabling them to support. Dara Khosrowshahi : Then just on the sponsored listings part of the business, the growth continues pretty significantly. We\u2019re a bit over 1% of delivery gross bookings through advertising, we had a target of 2%-plus. We think that target is certainly achievable, and actually for grocery and retail, we think that the number can be well over 2% based on what we see in terms of competitors, what we see in terms of what Amazon is doing. The focus for us with sponsored listings right now is increasing the number of monetizable impressions per user session through introducing new ad formats and placements, and really increasing the monetization of search in a smart way that doesn\u2019t hurt the core consumer experience, so we have holdout to make sure that advertising is a complement to our eater experience and at the same time is a targeted way for merchants to reach their audience. If you think about sponsored listings, sponsored listings tend to improve audience for a particular merchant, and then merchant-funded offers, because of the price nature of those offers, tends to improve conversion as well. For Uber profitability, the sponsored listings business is more profitable for Uber but we think merchant-funded offers are a very important strategic part of our drive to improve the affordability of the overall marketplace, and increasingly we\u2019re working with merchants to be able to move money from sponsored listings to merchant-funded offers in a back and forth and a targeted way to achieve what their goals are. The team is doing a great job. We continue to invest in our sales team, and the technical teams continue to ship some pretty impressive product out there. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Let me give you one metric we haven\u2019t shared before, and that is globally, restaurant-funded offers or merchant-funded offers have grown 70% year-over-year. John Colatuoni : Thank you both. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right, can we get the next question? Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ross Sandler with Barclays. Your line is open. Ross Sandler : Hey guys, one more follow-up on ads. With talk about getting to 1.6% of gross bookings for ride hail ads, so I know we talk about delivery ads quite a bit, but what\u2019s the status of your ride hail side advertising business of late? Then the letter mentioned the Instacart initial read. Can you provide a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing thus far from the Instacart partnership? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. For mobility ads, we haven\u2019t introduced a target in terms of the percentage of gross bookings. We are very, very sensitive to the fact that people come to Uber looking for a ride first, and to the extent that we introduce them to some of the premium brands that are advertising with us, we want to make sure that that experience is an excellent experience for the rider and also an excellent experience for the advertiser. It\u2019s resulting in some very strong ad engagement from riders - click-through rates are over 2.5% compared to industry averages that are less than 1%, so I think for us, the focus is more on quality versus quantity, and I think that we\u2019ll continue that focus going forward. The contribution of advertising is very, very positive in terms of newer ad formats that we are introducing, improving targeting capabilities, and then also investments in measurement and attribution for our ad partners, so we\u2019re very, very happy with the progress here, but I don\u2019t want to put a percent target because the experience of the rider comes first. In terms of Instacart and the trends there, we\u2019re very encouraged by the trends there. We talked about Instacart baskets being 20% higher than our base basket sizes, and we\u2019re seeing the demand come from a lot of suburban markets - you know, it kind of matches the Instacart geographic penetration, so we do think that the incrementality of the volume from Instacart is quite strong, and I\u2019d say so far the partnership has been an excellent one. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Maybe just a reminder to folks, we only went live in the second quarter of \u201924, where Uber Eats is live on the Instacart app, so it\u2019s still early days. All right, can we take our final question? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, let\u2019s do it. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Okay, thanks. Two questions please. On the TAM comment, Prashanth, that you made earlier, I think you said in your top 10 markets, less than 20% penetration. My recall is that about a year ago, you\u2019d said it was a little under 10%, so you\u2019ve had nice growth there. Are there particular markets where you could--like, what are you lead markets, like how high have you seen that penetration go? I assume that you\u2019re going to be able to go higher than 20%, but any clues you\u2019ve seen in the markets that you\u2019ve been in, that tell you how high that could go would be helpful. Then could you also talk overall about subsidies and incentives for drivers and consumers and where those are now, and is this something that\u2019s kind of a flat line expense going forward? Is there more leverage as a percentage of bookings, or even in absolute dollars, how do you think about those incentives and subsidies going forward? Thanks a lot. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes, thanks for the question. I think a good frame of reference, or an example to help you with that TAM, if the United States was to move to the TAM penetration that we are seeing in the U.K., that\u2019s worth another $13 billion in gross bookings, so call it 8% or so of our current run rate, just by moving the U.S. to the U.K. We know the opportunity is there. Brazil, I think is another great example where we\u2019re seeing really explosive growth. The frequency in Brazil is a really impressive number that also I think is a great metric for how we have confidence as we continue to feed more markets and continue to expand our mobility products\u2019 availability, reliability into more geographies. That\u2019s going to continue to provide runway, and that sort of links into your second question, which is as we think about balancing supply and demand, I would say the overall sentiment at a global level today is that supply is in a better position than it has historically been. That may not be true in all markets, but at a global level, it is. What that allows us to do is to pivot those incentive dollars into driving demand, and one of the challenges, I think as the leadership team at Uber faces is we have so many areas that we could pivot those dollars into, and they greatly exceed our ability to fund within our financial framework that we gave you, so much of the time is spent on capital allocation to ensure that we are both making decisions that are right for the near term in terms of continuing to make sure the market is liquid, but also providing the right incentives that we need to continue to fund future growth products. I think our Teams product, as an example, which is one that we\u2019ve launched, and I may ask Deepa to help me here with the metric, I think Teams\u2019 user base is up--was it up 100% Deepa, am I remembering the number right? Yes, up 100%, and that\u2019s a relatively new product that we\u2019ve launched but that takes some investment to increase awareness about the product, but once you\u2019ve done that--sorry, it\u2019s trips, trips that were up, so those are the trade-offs, I think that we continue to make a decision on. This quarter, we opened up Hungary--sorry, we opened up Luxembourg, and last quarter we opened up Hungary, so we\u2019re continuing to find new geographies as well as expanding in existing countries into new areas. Look for us to continue to make that balance while trying to stay within that great operating framework we gave you of driving mid to high teens GB growth with higher 30% to 40% EBITDA over the next three years. Mark Mahaney : Thank you Prashanth. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: I think with that, we\u2019re going to wrap the call and we\u2019ll turn it back to you, Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, thank you very much everyone for joining the call, and a huge thank you to the team at Uber. Prashanth and I and Deepa get to talk to investors about all the accomplishments and the consistent execution of the team, but it\u2019s actually the teams on the ground, the technical teams who deliver in good markets, bad markets, uncertain markets, and we certainly wouldn\u2019t have the kind of execution that we\u2019ve had without everyone at Team Uber contributing, so big thank you to Team Uber. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: And just a reminder, we\u2019re going to be on the west coast, in Chicago, in New York, and in Europe in the coming quarters, so we\u2019re very accessible for folks. Reach out to Deepa if you want to see us. Dara Khosrowshahi : Awesome. We\u2019ll talk to you next quarter. Thank you again. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Deepa Subramanian, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Deepa Subramanian : Thank you, operator. Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation. On the call today, we have Uber CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi; and CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. During today's call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are included in the press release, supplemental slides and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investor.uber.com. Certain statements in this presentation and on this call are forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements we make today, except as required by law. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today as well as the risks and uncertainties section described in our most recent Form 10-K and in other filings made with the SEC. We published our quarterly earnings press release and prepared remarks, supplemental slides to our Investor Relations website earlier today, and we ask you review those documents if you haven't already. We will open the call to questions following beef opening remarks from Dara and Prashanth. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Deepa. Uber delivered yet another strong quarter, a record quarter of profitable growth with gross bookings up 20% year-on-year in constant currency. We also generated an all-time high GAAP operating profits of more than $1 billion. This performance was powered by new records in audience and frequency as more people and more places are using Uber more often. Our underlying platform continues to strengthen, more than 7.8 million people now drive, deliver shop with Uber, earning more than $18 billion during the quarter. More than 25 million people are now Uber One members, up 70% year-on-year. Our advertising business grew nearly 80% year-on-year, and our autonomous strategy is working as our 14 AV partners are clearly understanding the significant value Uber can bring to their deployment plans. Thanks to the team for another great quarter. And before we go to Q&A, I'd like to hand it over to Parashanth to briefly reiterate our capital allocation approach. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Dara. Let me add my welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I wanted to jump in quickly with an update on our share repurchase program as well as a reminder of the capital allocation framework that we presented at the investor update back in February. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged, responsibly investing in future growth and returning capital to shareholders. On the growth front, we believe we still have a huge amount of organic opportunity in front of us, including our fast-growing portfolio of new products, which are now cooking at $20 billion of annual GB, with geographic expansion, especially into less densely populated markets, and lastly, with increasing user frequency, including through our membership efforts. On capital returns, we plan to steadily increase our share repo in the coming quarters. Specifically, we intend to work our way towards a durable share count reduction in 2025. Now to quickly touch on M&A, we remain extraordinary disciplined, and I want to emphasize that all opportunities are reviewed with a rigorous value creation mindset and Uber's bar for M&A has never been higher. As Dara has said, the best deal is not having to do a deal at all, and we are in that enviable position today. So we are excited to continue on our exceptional path of organic growth while sticking to our firm commitment to you, our shareholder, of capital returns. So with that, let me hand it back to Deepa to open the call for questions. Deepa Subramanian : Sarah, can we have the first question, please? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Eric Sheridan : The commentary, especially around the capital allocation policy. I want to come back to the concept you introduced in the letter around less dense markets. Could you go a little bit deeper in both the opportunity set, but also some of the operational dynamics of building supply as well as stimulating demand in less dense markets? And how we should be thinking about that scaling in the years ahead? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, Eric. We think it\u2019s a terrific opportunity. And frankly, sometimes we take ourselves for not recognizing it properly earlier. Uber started as a company in the middle of big cities, and our biggest cities, Sao Paulo, New York, et cetera. Continue to be the largest source of demand. But continuously, we\u2019ve seen that growth outside of the core in the boroughs of New York now extending into the suburbs or in secondary and tertiary cities has been higher than the core itself almost accidentally, and this is true for Mobility and Delivery as well. And really for us, the start of our focus on less dense areas started with Delivery. In the U.S., especially if you look at noncore cities, et cetera, it\u2019s 60%, 70% of the market, so the majority of the market there. Generally, it\u2019s growing faster than city centers as well. So we\u2019ve really started focusing on improving selection in those areas. And then like you said, then building out the liquidity that's necessary in terms of both demand and supply, couriers and making sure that those couriers are busy. And that kind of cycle, that positive cycle of investing in supply and demand together, increasing liquidity, getting better ETAs, getting better service levels starts to accelerate and add to itself. And we\u2019re starting to see that now in Delivery, but not just in the U.S. We\u2019ve extended this focus in the U.K., Australia, really all over the world. We\u2019re looking at the density by quartile of all of the areas that we deliver to or all the areas that we are giving mobility services to people to, and we are actively investing in those less dense areas. And we think the opportunity set there is very, very significant, both in Mobility and Delivery. So we think it\u2019s early days and \u2013 but it is a focus of both Mobility and Delivery. And I think it will be a tailwind to our core business in terms of growth over the next 2 to 3 years and hopefully even more than that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak : I have two. First of all, I wanted to sort of drill in a little bit more to the U.S. mobility bookings trends. Dara, you sort of look at how the business has trended since your investor update. Are there any areas where you're sort of exceeded or come in a little shy versus where you thought the U.S. rides business would be growing? And has anything changed in sort of your outlook for U.S. rides contribution to growth over the tenure of the outlook that you gave at the investor update? That's the first 1 on U.S. rides. And the second one, just on Phoenix and sort of Arizona around Vaymo. Anything you can share on sort of early signs of incremental volume to Uber from the Vaymo partnership in that market? Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. Absolutely. So in terms of our U.S. mobility growth, the U.S. generally has been kind of the gift that keeps on giving. It\u2019s our largest market, a little less than 50% of our GBs, but more than 50% of our profitability. So the business continues to grow and thrive. We are seeing in the U.S. a couple of trends. One is that we\u2019ve been very public in terms of the increase \u2013 the substantial increase in commercial insurance costs really that have happened over the past 2 years. And as we have passed on those increases in cost, especially in states where insurance costs are very, very high, like New Jersey or California. As we pass on those costs, we\u2019ve seen the \u2013 kind of the typical elasticity from consumers, which is as GBs, as price goes up, the transaction growth slows down a bit. And that elasticity is usually one for one. It\u2019s no different than what we\u2019ve seen. And actually, we\u2019ve seen our competitor do the same as well. We are seeing weekday growth stronger than weekend growth as well. So people are definitely getting back to back work. I think like the weekend party hours, maybe consumers are a little more price sensitive in terms of whether they choose to go out or not, but weekday is very strong, and Uber For Business especially is very, very strong. Overall, it\u2019s up over 50%. I\u2019m not sure what the U.S. number is, but it\u2019s really strong, both in terms of selling to enterprises, selling to health, selling to transit systems as well. That is definitely a bright spot for our business as well. And then we\u2019re not really seeing any signs of consumers trading down. Like our share product is growing very quickly as match rates continue to increase. We\u2019re investing in newer products like Uber Teens to kind of bring in this new demographic into our system and then shuttles into our system as well. So overall, we\u2019re quite optimistic in terms of how the U.S. market is developing, but those insurance cost increases are definitely resulting in the kinds of slowdowns in transactions that we expected based on elasticity experimentation that we\u2019ve done in the past. I think the good news is that while the insurance cost will continue to go up, we expect them to go up at a lower rate, so to speak, both because the market is normalizing and because we\u2019re taking a lot of action in terms of safer routes, safer drivers, encouraging drivers to drive more safely to try to get those insurance costs down, but that\u2019s kind of a slow-moving target, so to speak. So pretty optimistic in general in terms of the U.S. markets overall going forward. And then to your second question in terms of autonomous and incrementality, in Arizona and Phoenix, at this point, Brian, it\u2019s really too soon to tell. We have relatively modest number of vehicles out there. We know that the experience with Vaymo is absolutely terrific. It\u2019s a delightful experience. Riders are rating their Vaymo driver at very, very high levels. And so we love the experience that it is bringing forth. I think the real test is going to be the expansion of our partnership, and it\u2019s a significant expansion with Vaymo in Austin and Atlanta. We\u2019re starting next year, you\u2019re going to get Vaymos in the hundreds in those markets. And I think then we will see whether there\u2019s incrementality as it relates to autonomous or not. But we\u2019re pretty optimistic where we sit. And I will remind you, too, that we\u2019ve got 14 different AV partnerships and not only are we expanding with Vaymo that we\u2019re really happy about, but you will see expansions with many of our other autonomous partners in domestic and international markets on the AV side. Operator : Your next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Doug Anmuth : I'm going to stick with AV. Dara, can you just talk more about your goals here in doing fleet ups in AV world and some of the ways that you'll be able to drive some greater efficiencies for AV tech providers? And then maybe you could just talk about San Francisco a little bit, perhaps any impact that you're seeing in that market from Vaymo? And is there anything notable to call out on volume, frequency or loyalty in San Francisco? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, definitely. So generally, in terms of fleet ops, the background of ops is we have been partnering and working with fleets and building up our fleet operations kind of practices for years and years. Typically, we have about 15% of our global mobility supply hours come from fleets. And this is a supply that\u2019s dedicated to us. So they tend to work longer hours. They were kind of multiple shifts in terms of drivers and the supply is dedicated to us, which is terrific. And we work with these fleets in many countries in the U.S. and Europe as well in Spain, for example, and many other countries as well. So fleet operations is something that we built, for example, we have special tools for fleets to be able to manage our fleet to be able to drive high utilization of their cars based on demand, et cetera. And so we\u2019re really extending this practice to the AV space. Housing, charging, cleaning cars can be expensive, and we think just like their advantages to a platform, a global platform being demand to drive the utilization of these AV fleets, we think there\u2019s also an advantage to a global player establishing fleet operations to take care of kind of the local complex logistics that happens in a more efficient way and we think more cost-effective way for our partners as well. So it\u2019s just another way in which we want to be kind of the best demand and operational local operation platform for AV out there. And we\u2019re really excited to get started with Vaymo, and hopefully, we can expand from there. In terms of San Francisco, we see that Vaymo is on the streets here all the time. And in the areas where Vaymo operates, we do see them have category position in the high single digits or low double digits. We aren\u2019t seeing any effect in terms of our consumers one or the other. The price is generally at a bit of a premium to X. It\u2019s more of a, call it, a comfort electric type of a price out there. And it\u2019s a great product, and we\u2019ve been competing with Lyft. And \u2013 in San Frisco [indiscernible], we compete with Waymo as well. But we\u2019re very happy to kind of extend our partnership with them and really start to build together in cities like Atlanta and Austin. And hopefully, that will be the dominant way forward for that partnership going forward. Operator : Next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Justin Post : I guess just go to mobility bookings decelerated 3 points to 24%. I know it's a tougher comp. But anything unusual or anything that surprised you in the quarter? And then the incremental take rates and margins were quite strong in Mobility. How do you think about where you are on those and the drivers of growth there as we go forward? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Justin, I\u2019ll take the first part of that. So maybe let\u2019s start with sort of the recap of how we did for Q3. So gross bookings at 20% on constant currency. And remember, that\u2019s our fourth quarter now of clocking at least 20% growth. That came from audience and frequency as it has for the last several quarters, audience really driving the majority of that at 13% frequency at fourth. And then with the leverage that we\u2019ve been able to drive the financial leverage, we are able to get EBITDA growing at almost 3x the rate of gross bookings growth. Your comment on sort of where is Mobility headed. Really the \u2013 we speak about the trips at the Q4 level, I think, in the prepared remarks, to be similar to what we saw in Q3 with a little bit of deceleration driven by less year-over-year pricing impact is sort of what we\u2019re seeing down the LOB lines as well. So again, you should expect trip activity for Q4 to be sort of in line with what we saw in Q3 with a little bit less benefit from pricing, both you don\u2019t see as much year-on-year increase from insurance in Q4 as well as on the delivery side, you don\u2019t \u2013 you see the \u2013 some of the benefits of the efforts we\u2019re making to drive affordability impacting basket size. So overall, we still feel kind of this is a large business that continues to grow at a very good rate. And I would say that think of Mobility growing sort of in the low 20% range on a constant currency basis in Q4 and then EBITDA margin probably flattish sequentially. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Mahaney with Evercore. Mark Mahaney : Okay. I'll just double-click two things on the insurance costs. So Dara, just talk about, are those -- where are those in international markets? Is that primarily a U.S. market problem and specific state problem? Or is there -- is that a global challenge, rising insurance costs? And then then let's talk about advertising a little bit too. So that growth is pretty robust. The sustainability -- that's very high growth rate that you're doing 70%, 80%. The sustainability of that? Or as you think about the opportunities and -- particularly on the delivery side, where do you think you are? Are there lead markets where you've got you're at several percentage points of bookings and most of the markets you're well under 1%. Just talk about that path of adoption. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thank you, Mark. This is Prashant. I'm going to take insurance and Dara is going to take ads. So insurance is primarily a U.S. phenomenon for us that -- where we provide insurance to our drivers when they are on their way for -- to pick up a rider and then again when the rider is on trip. The -- we talked about this in prior quarters that we've seen pretty steady increase in insurance. And this last quarter was no different. The CPI for motor vehicle insurance in the U.S. was up 16% year-over-year in September, but that is starting to moderate. I think Dara mentioned that earlier on in one of the questions. Remember, it peaked sort of in the low 20s back in the spring. So as we look forward to 2025, I'd say we expect the insurance cost to continue to increase, but at a pretty significantly modulated rate compared to what we've seen over the last 2 years. And as we've said many times, there's a lot of effort that we have to help drive that insurance cost down and really bend the curve that includes the deployment of safety technologies that we're putting in the risk management program we have, which includes sort of the relationships we have with our [indiscernible] driving some of those initiatives where we've actually been able to see success in insurance in a couple of states, Georgia, Texas, for 2 -- as 2 examples. And our our principle has been unchanged on this. We pass along insurance cost increases, and we pass along insurance cost decreases. So as we make progress on insurance, you'll see us continue to pass those benefits on to our riders. Let me pass off to Dara to take your question on advertising. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. So advertising, we\u2019re obviously very, very pleased with the growth of our advertising business. We\u2019ve always said that in Delivery, it can get to 2% plus of gross bookings were in the mid-1%. So we\u2019re right in between 1% and 2% at this point. So we\u2019re making good progress there. And if I were to generally split our advertising business into kind of 4 different categories : one is the CPC kind of bidding for placement for small businesses. That business continues to progress really, really well. We\u2019re able to increase the number of monetizable impressions per user session, so kind of increasing the ad load a little bit with little or no penalty to the user experience because the ads are really targeted. We\u2019re showing high-quality restaurant and high-quality choices to users as well. So our kind of SMB, small medium business, CPC business continues to grow at very, very high rates. Our penetration with enterprise is generally a little bit lower than SMB advertisers, but that is growing quickly as well. And some of the larger enterprises, they\u2019re looking to target different consumers, they\u2019re looking to target different segments of the day, for example, that might be breakfast, that might be lunch, that might be thinner or they\u2019re looking for consumers that are net new or incremental. So kind of the tools that we\u2019re building for enterprises are a bit more sophisticated in terms of tracking, targeting, et cetera. And we\u2019re making really good progress there with our ads team. And then we\u2019re really focused on our sponsored listing product. This is for groceries. And these are CPGs, et cetera, the Cokes and Pepsis of the world who can advertise on our grocery product in order to increase their share in our marketplace. And we\u2019re very, very early in the development of that product. We\u2019re launching about 8 different markets now, again, looking to mature tool set for the enterprise advertisers. And then at the same time, we just have to keep building our grocery business to be bigger and to become an absolutely necessary buy for the big brands out there, the big global brands out there. And based on the growth rates that we see in our grocery business and the number of partners that we\u2019re bringing in, we\u2019re quite optimistic that we are getting there. And then the other area that we\u2019re pretty excited about is our mobility advertising. These are our journey ads. We are really kind of restricting that space to very, very high-quality advertisers. Click-through rates are 2x to 3x that of industry averages. So the advertising is getting the attention of the riders. We\u2019re very careful there not to hurt the rider experience, which is \u2013 which kind of is as a result of our focus on ad quality. We are \u2013 we recently announced a partnership with T-Mobile Advertising Solutions to bring our Journey TV offerings to about 50,000 vehicles across the U.S. So we think that will be another jump start to our mobility advertising solutions as well that we\u2019re quite optimistic about. Ultimately, we think mobility advertising is an opportunity for us to increase margins, but also increase the ability for drivers to earn more with these tablets, for example, in their cars to the extent that it improves driver earnings and their quality of life, we think that\u2019s a terrific thing as well. So very pleased with how the ad team and tech teams are delivering, and we think we are midway along this journey and have plenty of room for growth ahead of us in all 3 areas, whether it\u2019s CPC or sponsor listings or mobility solutions. Operator : Next question is from Ron Josey with Citi. Ron Josey : Maybe, Dara, I wanted to stick on the delivery side a little bit here and understand just what's driving the map season frequencies? I think we said in the letter [indiscernible] exceeded $50 million in the quarter, frequency reached all-time highs. And so I just want to understand on the delivery. Can you talk about just how are new maps coming on for restaurants? Or has that evolved a little bit more to newer verticals, just given the investments and awareness around grocery and pretty much everything that Uber has to offer. I guess that's question number one. And then question number two on frequency overall. 25 million Uber One members globally, teen trips up 40%. We'd just love to hear your thoughts on just other initiatives on driving greater frequency across the platform. So 1 is on delivery, two is on overall frequency. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, absolutely. So on delivery, listen, we\u2019re pleased with the results. It\u2019s another quarter of 17% growth in terms of gross bookings. And listen, on the [indiscernible] side in terms of audience, first of all, delivery is \u2013 it\u2019s a big category. I think the growth in the category continues to surprise many, maybe including ourselves. And it is the main line Uber Eats business that is bringing on the new audience, I would say, significantly assisted by mobility as well. We have the unique differentiator in our marketplaces, which is we have our mobility business with an Eats tab right on top of it and also actively cross-promoting users between Mobility And delivery, and increasingly now from Delivery to Mobility as well. So about 1/3 of our new audience comes from a Mobility business, and it\u2019s a lower-cost audience and obviously very much engaged with the platform. But we are continuing to invest in increasing advertising and increasing brand spend all around the world and the message that\u2019s landing with Uber Eats is obviously a message that is resonating, we gain category position as a result of kind of that increasing audience and Delivery in 10 \u2013 of our top 10 markets. So more people are hearing about us and it is resulting in category position gains that we\u2019re very happy about. And then for us, in terms of frequency, number 1 is just the quality of service, increasing selection, making sure that on-time rates continue to increase, making sure that unfulfilled or errors in terms of deliveries, not getting what you wanted continues to decrease. So we are continuing to kind of grind if you want to call it that, in terms of customer experience. The better you are, the more people stay with you, and you want to avoid those situations where something happens, something unexpected happens or a poor experience happens, which can cause that consumer to look for alternatives. And then once we have that core experience improved, then the focus is on membership. Members spend 3x more than nonmembers. Retention rates are higher for members as well. And with 25 million members, up 70% year-on-year, you can see the momentum as it relates to that part of our business as well. So I think it\u2019s all coming together very well. And you can see it in the \u2013 both the top line results and our margins continue to increase, and in terms of our category position improving versus our competitors as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Nikhil Devnani : Thanks for the commentary on capital allocation. It seems like in other areas of the business, whether it's dark stores and delivery or autonomous vehicles, you've opted for more of a partnership approach to say, capital efficient. So I guess, could you just remind us how you think about partnering versus buying your way into a new vertical or a new market? What makes an acquisition a better path in your mind? And where does further expansion and diversification of the Uber platform to adjacent opportunities fit in your priority set right now considering the transition that is happening around the core business with autonomous vehicles? Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, Nikhil. We're going to do this in 2 parts. I'm just going to do a refresher on how we are thinking about capital allocation to give everyone the opportunity to make sure then I'll let Dara kind of talk about how we do those trade-offs between when partnership makes sense. So just as a reminder to everyone, and I said this at the start of the call, our #1 priority is responsible organic investments aligned with the growth strategy, focused on what's going to drive free cash flow. We've got plenty of opportunity ahead of us. We've talked about on the mobility side, things like [indiscernible] on Delivery. We have our groceries and our direct business. And then we have the terrific [indiscernible] platform, which sort of spans both products. Back in February, we also said liquidity was important to us, and we had a goal of getting to investment grade. We actually got there much faster than we were expecting. In Q3 of this year, we hit IG, which is a great accomplishment for us. And now it really allows us to focus on really the return of that excess capital to shareholders. So we will continue to selectively evaluate M&A, but it's a really high bar, and it's going to have to be both strategic value and financially accretive. I think Foodpanda is a terrific example of how we think about that, where it was a clear win both strategically where Taiwan is such a great market for Uber Eats given its high frequency and great membership coverage. And then financially, the deal is very accretive with the likelihood that we'll get an incremental $150 million in EBITDA pretty shortly after we close. So beyond that, get our capital back to shareholders. And again, I made this point in the opening, but I want to restate it. The repo program is the primary vehicle on that. And now we feel pretty good that we're going to be at a share count reduction in 2025. So having said that, I'll pass back to Dara now to get into when do partnerships make sense. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. So generally, when we look at partner versus acquisitions, et cetera, or whether we want to actively get into an area, really, we ask ourselves : one is, can we really get into an area with a proper focus? Is it substantially related to the core? And then second is like can we add value? And the example of [indiscernible], for example, we just concluded when we looked at that segment, there are millions of retailers out there. It is all they do. And we, as a tech-first company, couldn\u2019t add a bunch of value to what these retailers are doing, and we\u2019d rather partner with them to extend their reach and then to complement their services in certain segments, for example, fulfilling for them, our direct business that allows some of these retailers to fulfill whatever product that they\u2019re serving like a Walmart or an Apple. So if we can\u2019t uniquely add value, if it can\u2019t be a core focus of the company we\u2019ll look to partner [indiscernible] for example of autonomous, we were in that business, but it wasn\u2019t [indiscernible] of the world where autonomous is all we do, and we can bring them the complement, which is our demand and our operations, local operations, which allows them to monetize the substantial investments that they are making. In terms of adjacencies and how we look at them, we will typically \u2013 because of the power of the platform, we will typically experiment with different adjacencies. We\u2019ve \u2013 on delivery, obviously, we started with food. We\u2019ve gone into grocery. You\u2019re going to see us getting deeper into any and all kinds of local retail as well. And with mobility, we started with cars, and we\u2019re going on 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers and buses and trains, et cetera, and we\u2019ll continue to kind of test out some of these adjacencies. Typically, we look for behaviors that are frequent, meaning you can get multiple interactions per month, and also can benefit from our expertise in terms of real-time local logistics as well. Our ability to match and price based on inventory on a given day that can change substantially from 9 a.m. to noon to 8 p.m. when we\u2019re pricing out our service, unlike many like traditional retailers, we don\u2019t even know what our inventory is. So we have to kind of do a scan of our real-time inventory in every market that we operate. It makes it a very, very challenging, but really interesting technical problem to be able to scan that inventory quick enough and then price that both on the demand side and the supply side. So where there are circumstances where we can bring value to them and where the customer interaction tends to be highly frequent or can take advantage of our local logistics and pricing and matching capability, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll look to act. And first, typically, we like to build things organically. We\u2019ve built a ton of businesses. Eats was built organically here. So building organically as part of the DNA of this company. And then if we see something really interesting, we will look at acquisitions. But again, like Prashanth said, we will be very disciplined in terms of those acquisitions because the bar for return on investment is quite high at our shop right now. Operator : The next question is from Ross Sandler with Barclays. Ross Sandler : Just going back to the autonomous questions. So I guess on the Vaymo partnership, why only 2 cities? Why not something much broader? Is that an option in the future? And then you guys are an investor in Wave. Could you talk about how you see the second tier of the Robotaxi market behind Vaymo and Tesla evolving? When do you see that next wave of companies and fleets conceivably being on the road and on Uber specifically? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes, Ross, in terms of the two cities, really what you want to get is the proper liquidity in a city anytime that you launch. And with Vaymo as well and many other AV players, there's a need to kind of map different cities and map both originations and destinations. So there's an investment that goes into launching these cities. So it doesn't make sense to getting into 20 or 30 cities in kind of a thin. Way you want to go into a city with the proper investment in your depots, in your infrastructure, in your mapping, et cetera, so that you start getting a return on capital. And Vaymo and ourselves thought that these 2 cities are very attractive cities to launch it. And hopefully, we can go from there. But really, the focus right now is to make sure that Austin and Atlanta work the way that we believe that they will. In terms of other players out there, it's really hard to generalize. I think that Vaymo is clearly the leader in the industry. but there are many other players who are developing this technology. And these cars are live in many cities around the world, certainly in China as well. And so you will see deployments of other autonomous partners on the Uber network, so to speak, outside the U.S. coming up in '25. And I think that the autonomous kind of ecosystem will continue to expand across many different partners because the potential of the market, both in terms of saving a bunch of lives with safer drivers out there, but the potential in terms of extending mobility and making available to many, many more people and -- at a reasonable price is just so significant that many players are going to go after that opportunity. And I think we've shown with all of our partnerships that we are by far the best partner in terms of driving utilization and working locally with some of these partners. So stay tuned, you're going to see more launches coming up. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Sara, we\u2019ll take our final question now. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank. Benjamin Black : Can you just talk a little bit about the broader consumer landscape, how favorable is the state of the macro environment for you in some of your larger markets? What proof points or KPIs do you guys track that give you confidence that it's not deteriorating. And then the second one is on Uber Direct. Do you need to supplement that business with some incremental investments to drive deeper penetration? And in terms of your Darden deal, it's exclusive? Is that sort of the right way to think about the direction of travel for the structure of future partnerships? Dara Khosrowshahi : Yes. So I think generally, consumer demand continues to be strong. especially on services. Spend on services still isn't where [indiscernible]. So I think all service players travel, for example, Booking.com, I think reported last night, pretty strong results. So all kind of services providers are enjoying this. And if you look for us, in our audience is an all-time pie, frequency is at an all-time high, our consumer retention is up globally year-on-year in both Mobility and Delivery similar to the past couple of quarters as well. We're not seeing any signs of trade down in Delivery. It's something that we look at. So eaters are ordering more from kind of the $2 bucket versus the the $1 bucket in terms of our own ratings and in all top markets. So it looks like the consumer is strong. And when you look at U.S. and Mobility, gross bookings in the U.S., for example, they grew 17%, which is a very solid number. And then International actually grew faster than that. So international markets continue to be very, very strong, which is something that we are quite happy about. And then we continue to see very strong spend on the corporate side as well. U4B growth rates are very strong. 50% constant currency growth as we continue to penetrate into new accounts, but actually existing accounts continue to grow as well, and about 50% of our U4B business is premium, which is kind of black and comfort, et cetera. We're not seeing any signs of trade down there. So for now, the consumer -- all the consumer signs are strong, and we're certainly hoping that they stay that way. And then in terms of Direct, we continue to invest aggressively in Direct actually. You see the partners -- the partnerships with Darden. And some of the partnerships that we have are exclusive and some are not exclusive. It really depends. It's hard to generalize. There are some players who want multiple partners. I think one of the benefits that we bring in the direct business that we are global in nature. So one partner, especially global brands, can partner with us and we can integrate into their tech ecosystem and we can deliver for them in New York, and we can deliver for them in any international -- in Tokyo as well. And there are very few -- there's no one else who really has the global scope that we do. But as it relates to Direct, we're actively increasing our engineering headcount there and continuing to sign up more partnerships and also deepen our capabilities in terms of the services that we offer our partnerships. It's one of the fastest-growing parts of our business. And we think the extension of direct beyond just same-day delivery into kind of more fundamental parts of the fulfillment ecosystem as a real potential opportunity for us going forward. So I think that's it. Thank you, everyone, for joining. A huge thank you to the Uber team for all of the efforts that undergird kind of what Prashant and I and Deepa report to the Street. Another good quarter, and we're looking forward to closing out 2024 with a strong Q4. And I think for short, we're going to be talking on some of the investors in a couple Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yes. Thank you, Dara. We're going to be in Toronto, Miami, Boston and San Francisco over the next couple of weeks. So if that corresponds with anyone's interest, please reach out to depot. We'd love to see you. Dara Khosrowshahi : All right. Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

And if you would like to ask a question during this time, please press I would now like to turn the conference over to Deepa Subramanian, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Thank you, operator. Deepa Subramanian : Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to Uber Technologies, Inc.'s fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings presentation. On the call today, we have Uber Technologies, Inc. CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, and CFO, Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah. During today's call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, are included in the press release, supplemental slides, and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted to investors.uber.com. Certain statements in this presentation and on this call are forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements we make today, except as required by law. For more information about factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, please refer to the press release we issued today as well as the risks and uncertainties described in our most recent Form 10-Ks and in other filings made with the SEC. We published our quarterly earnings, press release, prepared remarks, and supplemental slides to our investor relations website earlier today, and we ask you to review those documents if you haven't already. We will open the call to questions following brief opening remarks from Dara. With that, let me hand it over to Dara. Dara Khosrowshahi : Thanks, Deepa. So the theme of this quarter is acceleration. We accelerated growth in audience, trips, and the top line. Gross bookings growth on a constant currency basis beat even our own expectations, coming in above the high end of our guidance. This performance was powered by strong product innovation across our platform, driving multi-product use to an all-time high of 37% of Uber Technologies, Inc. consumers. It was also a stellar few months for the Uber One membership program, where we added five million members in the quarter, bringing our total member base to 30 million, up nearly 60% year on year. We are now one year into the three-year outlook we presented to investors last February, and pleased to say that in 2024, we cleanly exceeded our commitments on all three components of that framework. Gross bookings, 21% versus our commitment to mid to high teens constant currency CAGR. Adjusted EBITDA grew 60% year on year versus the high thirties to forty percent CAGR. An annual free cash flow conversion as a percentage of EBITDA was 106% versus our indication of 90 plus percent. We are thrilled with this performance and have started 2025 with a lot of momentum. Despite FX headwinds, we expect continued strong growth in Q1, with 17% to 21% constant currency gross bookings growth and continued profit expansion. So lastly, on autonomous, I'd encourage everyone to read our prepared remarks in supplemental slides where we spend some more time this quarter sharing our perspective on the state of AVs. The key takeaway is that while AV technology is advancing, commercialization will take significantly longer. And we have conviction that Uber Technologies, Inc. will be the indispensable go-to-market partner for AV players. This is undoubtedly one of our top priorities, and we're investing a lot of technical, strategic, and management attention to this topic with lots more to come. Just today, we announced that Austin residents can sign up for an interest list right in their Uber app to increase their chances of matching with a Waymo AV when we launch next month. With that, operator, let's take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Nowak : Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, one on autonomous and one on the core rides business. So the first one, Dara, is on autonomous. As you think about the portfolio of assets you have at the company, do you think philosophically about investing more in autonomous assets, be it first-party car fleet or other fleet management tools? Or where are you on sort of the portfolio of the current assets from an autonomous perspective? And then on the core business, talk to us a little bit about how to think about puts and takes on rides incremental margins, and sort of profitability in the first quarter and throughout 2025? Thanks. Dara Khosrowshahi : Absolutely. So, Brian, I think on autonomous, we think we are very, very well positioned. We're investing aggressively across all parts of the portfolio. I think the way that you can think about it is that every new product that we build, we first build by going out and investing in supply and building out kind of liquidity on the supply side. And you really need that kind of magical liquidity to be able to match kind of variable demand and provide the five to six-minute, consistent ETAs in order for the network effect that you see on a local basis for us to work. And in autonomous, it's the same thing. Like, we did it with taxi. We've done it with low cost. We've done it with high capacity vehicles. Did it for Uber Eats in the past. It's just an investment in building out the supply base to match variable demand, and then the magic happens in a particular city. You'll see that magic in work in Austin coming up in a month. As far as investments that we made, you know, we're absolutely investing in fleet supply. This is an investment that we made for over a long time. Fleets now represent about 15% of our inventory. So while we are very well positioned to have kind of fleets in market that can manage autonomous, we are looking at acquiring a ton of depots with electric required for charging the fleets, etcetera. And, obviously, we are going out with various autonomous players and building out technical partnerships and then talking with OEMs about securing supply as their manufacturing platforms are preparing to get the scale for the next generation of autonomous. So it's a broad investment. It's across a very, very low number of units, so you're not really gonna notice it in the P&L. But we do think that this investment is going to prepare us as autonomous starts to scale and as kind of the commercial economics start to be apparent. But even with these investments, which I would term as aggressive investments, you're unlikely to impact the three-year outlook that we've given you. We think we can. This is kind of the power of man, which is we can deliver and some of it through your outlook, and at the same time, we can be investing aggressively in AD supply in every way. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Brian, it's Prashanth. I'm gonna take the second part of that question, and I think your question was really around the mobility profitability trends and outlook. So maybe I'll start with just a reminder that we want folks to look at the business the same way we do, which is at a total company level. And we're making investment decisions across our segments based on where we see the strongest returns and growth potential. So we're gonna continue to invest in mobility consistent with the overall profitability framework that we gave you guys back in February. So I wouldn't read anything into sort of how mobility profitability was other than we're seeing a lot of opportunity to continue to invest and drive growth. In this quarter that just closed, our EBITDA margin was 7.8% of gross bookings, and that was up 30 basis points year over year. We see continued benefits from supply incentives, leverage on the operating cost, and partially offset some of that tailwind by higher insurance costs, which we've talked about before. But, overall, these investments are really helping us put up that strong mobility growth number, which was at a constant currency basis, 24% in Q4, and we saw acceleration in the US. So we're leaning into things like membership. I think, in the prepared remarks, we talked about 30 million members now that's up five million sequentially, and I think it's up 60% year over year. Teams is another great area. I think we've more than doubled the number of countries that Uber Teens is available in the fourth quarter. And the usual areas like finding the right balance in marketplace and continuing to open up new geographies and some products. So, again, it's part of our overall model that we gave you back in February of last year, which is to drive that mid to high teens GB growth and that high thirties to forty percent profitability, and we'll continue to make the trade-offs we think are necessary to hit those numbers and also ensure that once we leave that three-year framework, we're still driving a great top line. Thanks for the question. Brian Nowak : Great. Thank you both. Operator : The next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Eric Sheridan : Thank you so much for taking the questions. Maybe building on Brian's question on supply and just widening it out a little bit in both businesses. You talked on prior earnings calls about sort of extending the network as a potential stimulant for rider growth and supply density. Can you talk a little bit about those efforts and how they continue to scale and how we should be thinking about them as a potential growth driver for 2025 and beyond as you continue to scale into more areas of mobility? And then on the delivery side, any update on user behavior, obviously, the array of supply that's available to a shopper inside Uber Eats today is very different than it was twelve, eighteen months ago. What is that doing to user behavior, frequency, basket size? How should we be thinking about supply impacting those dynamics in the delivery business? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Great. Thank you for the question. So, first, just as a reminder for folks, the way we think of the business and we encourage everyone else to is our growth is a combination of audience, so the number of users who are hitting our platform every month, how often they are engaging with the platform, which we measure as frequency, and then you round it out with price to turn trips into GBs. So in the last couple of quarters, we've made some comments on how we're focusing on less dense or some of the sparser, which I think is where your question is coming from. So as a reminder, the growth framework through 2026 is for that core business to grow in the low to mid-teens and then the growth bets we're making to kind of help push us up into that higher teens. And the initiative that we're focusing on in those less dense sparse or geos is really around driving the penetration into those less dense areas so we can extend sort of a length of time that we can get that core business to continue growing at an attractive rate. One of the things we've observed is that in our more populated or dense areas versus where we were maybe two or three years ago, growth has started to come down a bit because those areas obviously are more penetrated. Now we can offset this by pushing out into less areas. This started initially as a US delivery initiative, and it's really expanded now into a global one. I would say that as we focused on the US delivery business, we realized that the same opportunity existed across mobility and really around the world. And we're finding real promise really on the mobility side both in the US and non-US as well as in non-US delivery. Where we're now creating some more programs in this space. We see much higher growth in these less sparser areas. I think we've talked about in the past that it's not uncommon for us to see one and a half or more times faster growth outside of more dense areas. And we do that a few ways. On the mobility side, it is supply. So it's really about where we are investing into supply such as creating incentives to bring new drivers into those areas, opening more cities and locations. For example, when you think of the UK, you often think of London, but for us now, Liverpool, Manchester, those become areas that we wanna continue to grow out in Europe. We've got our efforts to add taxis, which will help us in some of those more sparse or populated areas. So once we have the supply, then we can use incentives to make sure the pricing is right to spur demand and sort of get that flywheel going that is the magic of the Uber marketplace. And then on the product enhancements, I would say that the option that we give consumers who are in some of these less dense areas is they can pay with price or they can pay with time. If you wanna pay with price, you can use something like our reserve product, which will give you a very high accuracy if you'll know when your ride is gonna be there, and it allows us to use our marketplace tech to make sure that we find someone who's able to be at the location you want when you need them there, or if you're willing to pay with time, we extend the wait time, which allows us again, to use the marketplace algos to find drivers or couriers who are in the region, but may take a little bit more time to get there. And we're finding that in the suburbs, people are more open to longer wait times. And then I think on the delivery and the growth rates there, what we're doing, listen, the basics remain the same, which is it's all about selection, it's about price, and it's about quality. In terms of selection, we got over a million active merchants up about 16% year on year. These are big and small merchants. Our sales per merchant continue to increase on a year on year basis, but if you look at our total kind of penetration here, in our top ten markets, we have about a third of the merchants out on those markets. So we think there's a huge amount of runway as it relates to selection. Selection increases conversion, but also brings in new audience once eaters figure out that their great neighborhood audience is available on Uber Eats as well. Second for us is price, and the number of merchant-funded offers, so to speak, to lowering price is at an all-time high. This is a really important initiative in terms of merchants being able to promote on the network and getting boosted in terms of their sort order for that promotion. And then membership, which Prashanth talked about now, 30 million members up 60% year on year. That table membership essentially effectively is delivering discounts to our most loyal members. So price is actually something that we're very, very actively working on. And then, of course, quality, making sure that our defect rate or rate continues to go down in terms of making sure that every delivery is a perfect delivery. And then on the back end side, for example, as it relates to shoppers, for grocery, we're really focused on the quality of those shoppers. You know, it's a lot easier, for example, just to deliver, let's say, an online food delivery to a home shopping for twenty items, twenty-five items, and getting it perfectly right is much more a challenge. So we're really shifting our marketplace metrics from cost and efficiency to cost efficiency and quality as well. When you bring all that together, selection, price, quality, increased marketing campaigns, you hopefully, you'll see our Super Bowl campaign out there. You get a good combination of growth in merchants, growth in audience, growth in frequency, and it's all powered by our push into less dense areas and membership well. So we're very, very happy with the trends there. You saw delivery gross bookings accelerate quarter on quarter. And we think that's just more evidence that we got a long, long runway here. Alright. Next question. Operator : The next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America. Your line is open. Justin Post : Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. Couple of questions on the prepared remarks. Dara, you mentioned nine different AV companies. And also, you know, OEMs in your prepared remarks. US-centric, you know, we're only really seeing two companies with really high visibility right now. Can you talk about how you think the market could evolve from here and why it might not be just two companies and what you're seeing globally? And then on the constant currency outlook, I think you did 21% in Q4. You're guiding 17% to 21% in Q1, but also there's prepared remarks about kind of being stable. So maybe talk about what would drive you down to 17, 18% constant currency or what would cause you to be more at the higher end of the 21% in Q1? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Sure. I think on AVs, first of all, the opportunity we think in the US and worldwide for AVs is enormous. We estimate that the US market alone is a trillion-dollar opportunity as you commercialize APS scale and bring the unit economics down. And while, you know, we're incredibly excited in terms of the development of the technology, you see Waymo in market, obviously, who's a terrific partner. And a number of players including Tesla trying to, you know, get to prime time, so to speak, we think that the commercialization of the technology is gonna take way, way longer. And by the time that the technology commercializes, all over the world and in the US, you're gonna see many, many more players get over the finish line as it relates to technology. Just stepping back for a second, and this applies for the US and applies all over the world. There are five factors that you need all of which need to come together for scale commercialization of the business. And scale commercialization is like, ten, twenty, thirty percent of our volumes on a US basis, let's say, of a global basis. First, you have to get regulations. You gotta enable regulations. There are national regulations, state regulations, city regulations. Pretty complicated. All the team regulators have to get comfortable with this new technology on the streets affecting our everyday. Second, you know, in order to get regulators comfortable, we think you need a superhuman safety record. Like, we don't think it's good enough for an autonomous driver to be better than a human. I think we have the chance to be multiple times better than the human. And I think the industry should take that kind of chance and insist on a superhuman safety record. You're seeing Waymo definitely get there and many, many other players kind of working to get their safety record up and demonstrate that safety record as well. Third, you need a cost-effective hardware platform. Like, the hardware platforms now, they cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. You've gotta get to the tens of thousands of dollars. There's a lot of work to be done to get there in many, many years. To build out these scale hardware platforms. Fourth, you need, like, first-rate on-the-ground operations. This is what I was talking about before in terms of fleets and recharging and cleaning and, you know, finding lost items, millions of lost items we do every year. And then fifth, you need a high utilization network that can manage the variable demand every day on a seasonal basis. With flexible supply as well, which we think our hybrid network is kind of the best solution there. You need all five to come together, and we think the only way that all five could come together is Uber Technologies, Inc. partnered up with the AD ecosystem. And we think we're kind of an indispensable part of, again, achieving all five and moving from a really, really cool, amazing technology to a really terrific scale business. Now I think that you're gonna see lots of experimentation and a b players, you know, going direct, working with us, etcetera. But especially, we're looking forward to our launches in Austin, Atlanta, where I think we're gonna demonstrate, you know, AV provider like Waymo pretty clearly that a combination of a great and Uber Technologies, Inc. is the best combination out there. And I think this is gonna apply in the US, it's gonna apply all over the world. So today, when you're in the tech development phase, yeah, the US, you don't see too many players, but by the time all five of these entities come together, regulatory, etcetera, which is gonna be years from now, I think you're gonna have a number of players getting to prime time both in the US and internationally. I think that's great for the ecosystem. We think competition is great for the industry. Kinda you're seeing, you know, with deep seat coming in and generative AI, like, how exciting that competition is. And we think the same thing that's happening in generative AI is happening in AV as well. You'll see it definitely in the US, and you're gonna see it all over the world. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Justin, I'll take the second part of that question, which I think was on putting our Q1 guide in perspective. So let's maybe start with a recap of Q4. 21% GB growth at constant currency year over year, and now we have delivered 21% or four out of the last five quarters, and that growth continues to be led by audience, which is an impressive number when you think that we're adding roughly 20 million, a little over 20 million actives even at the scale we have today. It's a great indicator of how the product continues to drive or get acceptance across the globe. Gonna be relatively similar to Q4 on an underlying basis. So that is 17% to 21% on FX neutral GB growth and great leverage on that with up 33% at the midpoint for EBITDA. So I'll break down some elements of that GB growth to help put it in context. First, our guidance for the first quarter includes us overcoming some notable headwinds. First, we are lapping a leap year quarter from last year. And in the Q1 guide, we've already incorporated the impact from the devastating fires in Los Angeles as well as some unusual weather patterns, particularly in the south where there was some crazy snow that came through there, which did shut down a number of cities. So just making those adjustments there, you can easily get to another one to two points of GB growth if you were to normalize for that. Second, we've got the growth in Q1 again, going to be led by audience similar to what we saw in Q4. So we probably see a little bit of a rinse and repeat in terms of the breakdown between audience and frequency in Q1 versus in comparison to Q4. And third, where I'll spend a little more time just to help people understand is how to think about foreign exchange within the context of Uber Technologies, Inc. So we are expecting FX to be a larger top-line headwind in Q1. Think five and a half percentage points of headwind, and that compares to closer to three points in Q4. And about half of our GBs come from outside the US. And then of those that are outside the US, Latin America, which is a sizable region, represents about a quarter of our international GVs. So now focusing specifically on Latin America, we had a number of countries that saw significant currency depreciation against the US dollar. Notably Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil. And these are top twenty countries for us, so we certainly feel the impact of them on the top line. What is helpful for folks to remember with regards to Uber Technologies, Inc. is while we price our trips or our orders in local currency, we also pay our drivers and merchants in local currency, so that creates a natural hedge. Meaning that our profit exposure from those foreign currency fluctuations tends to be driven by those US dollar denominated expenses, which will be some of our tech organization, our G&A, and other US build cost structure. So the way we try to operate the company is that we will take FX on the top line, but as a management team, we do our best to absorb those impacts in the profit line, whether they be favorable or headwinds to us, to kind of continue to drive the consistent margin expansion story that you've seen over the last couple of years. Dara Khosrowshahi : And, Justin, I just one comment from me. Listen, I think a lot of investors ask how long can Uber Technologies, Inc. keep growing at the scale as fast as it does and sometimes on planning time, we do as well. I'll just remind you that our gross bookings growth rate this year actually accelerated over last year. So this is a business that continues to surprise us pleasantly in terms of the runway ahead. Justin Post : Great. Thanks for your time and attention. Dara Khosrowshahi : Great. Next question. Operator : The next question is from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Doug Anmuth : Great. Thanks for taking questions. I have two. Dara, first, just following up on the AV commercialization challenges, I'm curious if there's anything additional you can share on your experience with Waymo in Phoenix and just how you're helping drive utilization and demand there in particular. And then for Prashanth, just given the healthier pricing backdrop in rides that we're seeing through 2025, can you just talk about how you're thinking about the sustainability of insurance costs and those slower insurance price increases through the year? Thank you. Dara Khosrowshahi : Absolutely. So, Doug, in terms of AV, the first thing I've said I would caution is that the scale of these AV deployments both for us in Phoenix with Waymo generally, are really, really small right now. For perspective, like, our growth in San Francisco, Phoenix, and LA in Q4 accelerated versus Q3. So just the numbers are really small, and it's very difficult to, you know, get patterning based on these smaller numbers. Our very, very early experience in Phoenix suggests that and some of the other deployments that we've got suggest that the Uber Technologies, Inc. network is able to drive significantly higher utilization versus any kind of first-party network could just because of the scale and the variability in terms of supply and demand in a particular market. And, you know, the other pattern that we see is customers love the product. So the opt-in rate for customers the second time that they're offered an AV is significantly higher than the opt-in rate the first time. So it's a great product, and you see that in terms of pricing. You can actually price the product at a premium too, which is terrific. So those are very, you know, it's a great product. Doesn't really have an effect on an overall business. We're able to drive really strong utilization. We are now preparing for some pretty big launches in the tens going to the hundreds of vehicles later this year in Austin and Atlanta. And we will have much, much more to tell you about the results there, and you know, we're quite optimistic that the results are gonna be quite strong. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Great. That second question's I got insurance. Let me maybe I'll start with the reminder that the US mobility business is required to carry insurance with a liability coverage that is often, usually, much higher than what is required for other modes of passenger transportation. And in some cases, it can be up to fifty times more coverage than what is required in a personal vehicle. So it is a benefit that we provide to our drivers as part of being a contractor for Uber Technologies, Inc. So at a macro level, we're pleased to see that the insurance pressure is easing. The consumer price index motor vehicle insurance is now only growing at 11% year over year in December, which is still a big number, but it's down more than 50% from what we saw in April where it peaked in the low twenties. So with the external headwinds peaking, we are also starting to see the benefits of all the internal initiatives that we've been driving such as the tech innovation and policy work coming through. So our outlook now, and we might have signaled this last quarter, and I think we have more confidence today than we did even in Q4, that the US mobility's insurance cost is likely to be high single digits on a per trip basis in 2025, and that's meaningfully lower than we've seen for the last two years. It's coming from a couple of elements that we've talked about before. We've talked about tech, risk management, and regulatory. So let me just double click on a couple of those. On the tech side, last year, we were piloting and we are now expanding to almost all of our US markets. A driver insights dashboard, and this allows drivers to see more about their driving behavior. And we're pulling data from their phone and the telemetrics on things like speeding, harsh braking, or acceleration, etcetera. And it shows drivers how they can drive more safely to improve their driving score. What we're hearing from drivers is just the ability for them to see that information, which where they were not aware of before, is improving their behavior. But to sort of encourage that improvement, we are also expanding the use of our advantage mode for drivers. And this is where you can actually get higher earnings and better route matching opportunities if you have, among other things, a better driver safety score. So yeah, encouraging giving them visibility to the score and then sort of encouraging the behavior we want through economics is gonna continue to play out through the use of our tech. On the risk management side, we've essentially finalized terms with all of our carriers on the insurance side, and market pricing is stable. So we've got a much better view as we look into 2025 of where that is, and clearly having a captive insurance company and being able to offer to self-insure when we don't get the pricing we want continues to give us great leverage in those negotiations. And then lastly, a little bit longer cycle, but it's the regulatory work that we're going on. And you probably see us out in the news and in respective markets where we are. We're creating a bit more attention on the need for insurance reform on a state-by-state basis. We are starting to get progress in areas like Georgia, California, New Jersey with more to come. Dara Khosrowshahi : And just to clarify one of my earlier comments, the growth in San Francisco, Phoenix, and LA comment that I made was for all of mobility. That mobility growth in Q4 over Q3 in those markets actually accelerated our overall mobility business, not just safety. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: K. Alright. Done. We'll go to the next question. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Michael Morton with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. Michael Morton : Hi. Thank you for the question and appreciate the new remarks on AVs. I could follow-up on a question on a comment Dara made earlier. And just general business models with AV. When you talk about securing supply from OEM, speaking about Uber Technologies, Inc. buying cars directly? And then you're thinking over the long term about potential business models with AVs, could you talk about an agency model versus a merchant model of renting AVs for the day. And then a question we get from investors is how much of your global mobility business do you see being addressable by autonomous vehicles due to different driver costs in certain markets compared to the AV cost. Thank you so much. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. Absolutely, Michael. So in terms of the business model, I think there are gonna be there's gonna be a ton of experimentation around the business models. I think early on, you know, we've got a big balance sheet and we can buy cars. I think eventually it's gonna turn into the fleet partners that we have essentially buying cars and getting financing from third parties. That you see right now with electric vehicles. A lot of our fleet partners actually are able to finance these EVs, etcetera. In the early days, you're not gonna have kind of a financing construct in place, and clarity regarding what residual values are for these cars. So I think that, you know, we'll put up some balance sheet risk. Our fleet partners will put up some balance sheet risk over a period of time. I think that most of the ownership will be a combination of fleet partners. You might see some financial players, you know, kind of infrastructure players just like there are entities, REACH, that own hotels. You will have kind of fleet entities as well. And then, hopefully, there'll be some kind of individual ownership as well of people, small businesses putting up these cars and these fleets and taking care of the car, so sort of small business fleets. But, again, we see around the world for ourselves operating an SMB fleet model as well. So there's gonna be a ton of experimentation. But early on, you know, we will take some balance sheet risk in order to get catalyzed the industry, so to speak. But, ultimately, we think all of it is gonna be financialized. In terms of AV, I think a couple of things in terms of the addressable market. First of all, I think early on, right now, the cost of AV is building that comes close to the cost of drivers. So I think the first markets that are going to be penetrated are gonna depend on regulation, first of all. And, again, the regulatory environment is pretty complicated. And second is kind of the revenue per mile in the markets. This would tend to be US markets or European markets where the revenue per mile is higher and will tend to be in the center of cities. You know, the operation domain for many of these AV deployments is very, very limited and over a period of time is going to expand. So I think in the next five years, the addressable market's gonna be probably, you know, in the order of ten to fifteen percent of the overall marketplace. And then gradually is going to expand over a period of time over the next fifteen years or so. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Great. Thank you, Michael. Sarah, we have time for one more question. Operator : Thank you. Your final question will come from the line of Nikhil Devnani with Bernstein. Your line is open. Nikhil Devnani : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Dara, last time you talked about price elasticity and today the letter talks about affordability. And the Q1 EBITDA guide suggests it's starting to moderate that profit growth. First, how much of this EBITDA guide is impacted by FX? And then bigger picture, I guess, the skeptical take would be that pricing was a tailwind for the business for several years. We're now hitting that ceiling. And as you push more on affordability, gonna be a headwind to margins going forward. So in your view, why is that not the right take? How do you eventually get a good return on these lower-cost rides and drive operating leverage in the mobility business if you're leaning into that value proposition for consumers? Thank you. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Yeah. Nikhil, why don't I just take the first part of it and let Dara take the longer part of it there. I've mentioned, I went through a little bit on the FX side. And our philosophy on FX. Clearly, the impact of foreign exchange and the profits that we collect in those foreign jurisdictions when they come back to the US are worth less. And with more than half of our business outside the US, there is an impact there. We have chosen not to pass that volatility on to investors. We find ways to manage that, whether it be good news or bad news, within the company using the levers that we have and sort of that's been the philosophy of the company. We talked about that in the prepared remarks. So it is not a zero impact. It certainly weighs on the business, but for your modeling purposes, you should think of FX as a top-line impact and leave it to the management team in both good days and bad days to do what we can to show steady margin improvement regardless of FX. Dara Khosrowshahi : Yeah. Nikhil, I would say in terms of pricing, whether it's a tailwind or a headwind, I just say that the vast majority of pricing that we have taken in the market has been in the US. And the vast majority of that price increase has been hassle on cost insurance. So it shows up in gross bookings. It shows up in cost. And that part of the price increase is ultimately economically neutral. We've always believed in kind of a model where we build out premium products. So this is our U4B product, which is a highly premium reserve product well for U4B. We introduced business block as well and using the higher margin of the premium products to fund the lower-cost products like UberX share and shuttle, etcetera. Taxi, two-wheelers, three-wheelers. I think we've been able to consistently demonstrate in the past the ability to balance top-line growth and bottom-line growth, and that's our expectation going forward. And I would tell you that today, you know, when we talked about that three-year guidance in terms of mid to high teens top line and then a bottom line of in the thirties to forty percent growth, we are more confident than ever that we can meet that guideline in almost any pricing environment but kind of the way that we run the company is to run it for both top and bottom line. And I think you'll see us continue to deliver on both of those going forward. Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah: Thanks, Nikhil. So before we wrap up here, I wanted to share some news.
