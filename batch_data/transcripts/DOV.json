Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our first quarter results were highlighted by strong revenue growth, broad-based bookings growth and building momentum as we through the quarter. Most notable, fluids delivered 26% growth and Engineered Systems grew 7%. In all, we generated 7% revenue growth and grew EPS 9%. From a geographic perspective, our U.S. markets were strong. Our European markets continued to show improvement for the third consecutive quarter. Lastly, our China markets moderated sequentially. Now, let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, we continued to benefit from improving well activity and a modestly increased rig count, especially in the U.S. We should continue to see broad-based growth as the year unfolds driven by increased well completion. Our bearings and compression markets were very solid and should remain so for the balance of the year. Overall Energy\u2019s results were in line with our expectations going into the quarter. Within our Engineered Systems segment, we saw strong growth across both platforms. In our Printing & Identification platform, solid growth in both our fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets, complimented by acquisitions resulted in strong performance. The industrial platform also saw a broad-based revenue growth led by outstanding results and our waste handling and vehicle service markets. Our fluids segment outperformed, where our recent acquisitions plus healthy market conditions were both pumps and fluid transfer resulted in very solid revenue growth. Our pumps businesses are benefiting from strong demand in the plastics and petrochemical verticals. And first quarter results were boosted by strong project shipments into these markets. Our refrigeration and food equipment segment results were solid, though slightly below last year and our expectations, is the timing of customer projects impacted the quarter. Our bookings were very strong, giving us confidence in this segment\u2019s growth plan for the full year. Across the segment our customers continue to seek our productivity, energy efficiency and merchandizing solutions that enable them to better compete in their markets. In all, we were pleased with the start of the year. Business activity was strong and we executed well in our strategy. We continue to focus on growth through international expansion and acquisitions. The most notable initiatives were adding resources for artificial lift in Australia and the Middle East and the acquisition of companies in the digital print space. Regarding near-term business activity, we expect ongoing solid performance in Energy, driven by the continuing increase in well activity, continued growth in Engineered Systems driven by improved U.S. industrial trends and expanded global sales and service resources in Printing & Identification. Strong results in our fluid markets are the benefits of our recent acquisitions and generally helping global end markets. And greatly improve sequential results in our refrigeration and food equipment markets. Beyond these near-term trends, macro-trends such as improving U.S. industrial activity and the continuing recovery in Europe will also help drive growth given our geographic business mix. In addition to an improving macro-environment, we have ample opportunity to improve margin. We are working to drive synergies on our recent acquisitions and are increasing lean and productivity projects. As a result, we do expect stronger margin in the back half of the year as we continue to execute on these plans. Our pipeline remains active and we are working on several small to medium sized deals. In summary, I\u2019m very pleased with our results. The combination of a strong first quarter, growing bookings and backlog and our positioning with customers, give me great confidence that we will have an outstanding year. With that, let me turn it over to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Bob, good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start on slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today we reported first quarter revenue of $1.9 billion, an increase of 7%. Organic revenue grew 4% and growth from acquisitions was 3%. Adjusted EPS was $1.1, an increase of 9. Segment margin for the quarter was 16.7%, a 40-basis point decrease from last year. This result reflects solid execution in our core business and was in line with our expectations. Margin was impacted by recent acquisitions in three of our four segments and in all, had a 70-basis point impact in the quarter. Bookings increased 5% over the prior year period to $2 billion. This result represents 20% growth in fluids, and 11% growth in Engineered Systems. Bookings increased 2% in refrigeration and food equipment. Energy bookings decreased 7% primarily driven by tough comps on a large international artificial lift project. Adjusting for this project, Energy bookings increased 5%. Overall, book to bill finished at 1.98, which is in line with seasonal trends. Backlog increased 7% to $1.5 billion. Now turning to slide 4. Fluids grew 14% organically driven by strong markets and project related activities in plastics and petrochemical. Energy grew 4% on the strength of drilling activity. Engineered Systems also grew 4% with broad-based growth across both platforms. Refrigeration and food equipment declined 3% largely the result of project timing with our customers. Overall organic revenue growth was 4%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 3%, comprised of 11% in fluids, 3% Engineered Systems, and 1% in Energy. Now turning to slide 5 on our sequential results. Revenue was essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter where strong sequential growth of 5% in energy was largely offset by a 4% decrease in refrigeration and food equipment. Sequential bookings grew 8% largely in line with our normal seasonal pattern as all segment showed growth. Engineered Systems bookings growth was 11% broad-based across both platforms. And refrigeration and food equipments increased 10% driven by normal seasonality in our refrigeration markets. Energy bookings increased 9%, with growth in all end markets. Lastly, fluids bookings were up 3%. Now on slide 6. Energy revenue of $479 million increased 4% in earnings of $119 million were unchanged. Energy produced another solid quarter with revenue growth in both our drilling and production in bearings and compression end markets. Within drilling and production, growth was driven by improving well activity, especially Shale related, though partially offset by weak winch markets. Operating margin of 24.8% was down 90 basis points from last year, in line with our expectations. Bookings were $478 million, a 7% decrease from the prior year. Solid growth in bearings and compression was offset by tough comps in drilling and production, principally reflecting lumpy orders related to a large international artificial lift project. As reported, book to bill was one. Adjusting for this project, book to bill was 1.04 representing 5% growth. Now turning to slide 7. Engineered Systems had an excellent quarter, where sales increased 7% to $650 million and earnings of $92 million were up 11%. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue increased 11% to $264 million, driven by broad-based organic growth of 5% in recent acquisitions. In the industrial platform, revenue grew 5% to $386 million reflecting 4% organic growth. Our waste handling and vehicle service markets were particularly strong in this platform. Continued strong execution and cost reduction activities drove operating margin to 14.2%, up 40 basis points, reflecting solid leverage on volume. Bookings were $710 million, an increase of 11%. Our Printing & Identification bookings increased 19% to $283 million boosted by recent acquisitions and strong execution in the U.S. and China. Industrial bookings increased 5% to $428 million reflecting broad-based growth. Book to bill for Printing & Identification was 1.07, while industrials was a strong 1.11. Overall, segment book to bill was 1.09. Now on slide 8. Fluids posted an excellent quarter, where sales increased 26% to $345 million and earnings of $58 million were up 22%. Revenue was driven by strong organic growth of 14% across the segment with particular strength in our oil and gas and plastics and petrochemical end-markets. Our five recent acquisitions, contributed 11% growth. Segment margin was 16.8%, a decrease of 60 basis points from the prior year. Recent acquisitions aside, our core business performed extremely well in the quarter and achieved 20% margin on strong volume leverage. We expect overall segment margin to improve in the coming quarters, as we progress on the integration of these recently acquired companies. Bookings were $363 million, an increase of 20% driven by continued solid demand across most end markets and recent acquisitions. Book to bill was a solid 1.05. Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 9. Refrigeration and food equipment generated revenue of $411 million down 3% from the prior year and earnings of $45 million, a decrease of 14%. Revenue was impacted by the timing of orders in both refrigeration and food equipment markets especially early in the quarter. As the quarter progressed, refrigeration shipments began to accelerate. We expect that momentum to continue into the seasonally strong second quarter. Operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 10.9%. This result reflects good execution on lower volume and $5 million of one-time items in the prior year. Bookings were $494 million, an increase of 2%. Book to bill ended at a seasonally strong 1.20. Now going to the overview slide on page 10. First quarter net interest expense was $33 million, up $2 million from last year and in line with expectations. Corporate expense decreased $3 million to $31 million, largely reflecting reduced pension expense. Our first quarter tax rate was 30.7% excluding discrete tax benefits, in line with our prior forecast. Capital expenditures were $33 million in the quarter. Lastly, we repurchased 3.6 million shares for approximately $293 million in the quarter, completing our $1 billion program. Moving to slide 11. Our guidance remains unchanged. We continue to expect 2014 organic revenue growth to be broad-based at 3% to 4% with all segments prior forecast on track for the year. Completed acquisitions will add 3%. In total, we expect full year revenue growth of 6% to 7% and segment margin to be about 18%. Corporate expense will be about $123 million, interest expense remained $133 million. Our full year tax rate is anticipated to be around 31%. CapEx should be about 2.5% of revenue and we expect our free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue. Now, turning to the bridge on slide 12. The bridge is largely consistent with our last forecast. We\u2019ve increased acquisition slightly to reflect our recent activity. We have also made minor adjustments in a few other categories, now that we have a quarter of accruals (ph) behind us. In total, we expect 2014 EPS to be $4.60 to $4.80. This represents 9% growth at the midpoint. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob, for some final thoughts. Bob Livingston : Thanks, Brad. 2014 is off to an excellent start. We delivered solid revenue and earnings growth, and also saw strong quarter activity. Overall, I like our positioning and our serve to markets, and we continue to execute on our growth initiatives. Some of which are within our Energy segment, you\u2019ll see the continuing push to grow outside the U.S. especially in artificial lift. We also have ample opportunity to grow our core business by expanding our presence in faster growing basins, and increasing our application coverage in bearings and compression. In Engineered Systems, we plan on expanding our verticals served in Printing & Identification beyond our core fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets. Our strategy in the industrial platform is all about delivering customer productivity solutions. The focus is on reducing labor, improving safety and ultimately allowing our customers to compete more effectively. Fluids, has a large opportunity to expand into international markets and is targeting significant growth in markets outside North America and Europe. In addition, fluids intends to push their station in a box, retail fueling solution, expand our hygienic pump presence and pursue cross-selling opportunities into the North American plastics and oil and gas markets. In refrigeration and food equipment, we are pursuing a growth strategy that targets our customers\u2019 needs for productivity, energy efficiency and enhanced merchandizing systems to drive performance. As an example, we launched a reengineered refrigeration door package, which will provide an even faster payback to our customers on close the case projects. In addition, several of our businesses are releasing new products, especially in food equipment, which will enable us to expand on our already strong positions. In all, I am more confident than ever about our positioning and long-term prospects. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. With that Paul, let\u2019s take some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks, Bob. (Operator Instructions). And Jackie, if we can have the first question? Operator : Our first question comes from the lines of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi, good morning. Bob Livingston : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Good morning. I just had a question on refrigeration and food equipment. You had margins down a fair amount in Q1. But at the same time, you talked about sales trends improving in recent months. So, I just wondered how comfortable you were with the outlook for a sort of a flattish margin for the full year in that segment. Bob Livingston : Actually, the order activity in refrigeration and food equipment was quite healthy in the first quarter. And Julian, as we look at the second quarter, second quarter starts this, I call it the middle of the year, a seasonal ramp especially for Hill Phoenix. And I would tell you that we are very, very well loaded at Hill Phoenix for the second quarter. And I feel pretty confident on their plan, both on revenue and margins for the year. Your specific question about margins in the first quarter, if you were to back out and Brad commented on this in his script, if you were to back out of the first quarter of last year, I think it\u2019s the $5 million of one-time net gains. The first quarter margins are pretty similar to last year. And we feel very good about our plan here in the segment for the year. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Got it, thanks. And then within, just my follow-up is on the Energy business. You talked on the last call about some weakness in the sucker rods in parts of the U.S. I just wanted to check if that weakness is all kind abated now? And how you\u2019re feeling about your sort of forecast for the year on energy in terms of the rig count? Bob Livingston : Okay. So, you\u2019ve got two questions here, rig count and sucker rod activity. Sucker activity here in the U.S. recovered nicely. And I don\u2019t know what the growth rate is year-over-year or sequentially that\u2019s going to get into some detail here. But we were quite pleased with the artificial lift activity in the U.S. especially around sucker rods in the first quarter. Rig count, we came into the year looking at a rig count average for the U.S. of I think it was 1,760 some units, essentially flat with the average for 2013. It\u2019s been up a bit and I call it the second half of the first quarter, and coming into April, up above our expectations for that period. We\u2019ve actually raised our average now for the year to almost 1,800 units, about 2% increase. And we\u2019re feeling pretty positive about the energy outlook for the balance of the year. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Paul Goldberg : Hi, Joe. Bob Livingston : Good morning. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Hi, well, my first question is on fluids. If I heard you correctly I think the organic growth for the quarter was 14% and it was driven predominantly by petrochem and plastics growth. But then your guidance for the year is 4% to 5% organic growth. And so it clearly implies a pretty significant step down. And so, just help me understand that a little bit? Bob Livingston : I think you just summarized it very well Joe. We had a great first quarter. The organic growth rate as you said was 14%, don\u2019t expect that from us in the second, third and fourth quarters. I think that the balance of the year is going to be a little bit closer to our guidance for the year. I would tell you that their performance in their first quarter on revenue and supported by the booking activity in the first quarter would perhaps want to see us increase our forecast for the year. And I\u2019m reluctant to do that at this point in time. I\u2019d like to see how the order rates develop here through the first half or at least April and May here in the second quarter. But obviously with that first quarter performance, we feel quite bullish on fluids for the year. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : All right, that\u2019s helpful there. And just a follow-up on bookings, you had a good quarter, I think the book to bill was 1.09. Was there any impact for that book to bill from the acquisitions that came through this quarter or is that an organic book to bill? Bob Livingston : No, that includes the acquisition that includes the acquisition activity from 2013. I actually hear right now Joe, I do not know what the organic book to bill was. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay. I can follow-up with Paul on that one. Bob Livingston : Yes. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : And I guess, one last question. Really I guess on free cash flow, it seems like Q1 tends to be seasonally pretty well quarter, it seems fairly weak this quarter. You guys did not change the guidance. I\u2019m just kind of thinking about your free cash flow generation now as a standalone entity and how I should think of that moving forward, it\u2019s just a 11% of sales, the right way to think of free cash flow over the long term for you guys or perhaps some color there would be very helpful? Bob Livingston : Yes, well, we agree with you the first quarter was little bit lower than I think we would have expected going into the year. But that doesn\u2019t change our views about the cash generation of the portfolio in the company. We do see sometimes impacts as revenue ramps up, ramps down, you\u2019ll see that through into the second quarter for normal seasonality. But we feel very confident with the 11% for the year. If you look at our profile, our profile is a company that generates most of the cash from the tail end of the year, that\u2019s just way the second and third quarter is usually setup and the fourth quarter being lower than those. And a high collection type of period for us. In the long run we feel confident on that 11% number. Joe Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, great. I\u2019ll get back in queue. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thanks, good morning. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Yes. So, just going back to the book to bill ratio, if 1.2 for refrigeration very strong. I mean, obviously it\u2019s here with about 1 in 1Q but just in terms of some loan refrigeration on the new basis, 1.2. Would you say that\u2019s normal or would we say that\u2019s actually better than what you normally see? Bob Livingston : Maybe a bit better than the average. But let me share something else with you, Nigel. And I don\u2019t have this on all of the businesses, but I tend to watch this one pretty closely here in the first quarter. Book to bill for Hill Phoenix, all in, all of it for Hill Phoenix was a very healthy 1.3 in the first quarter. And that, I share that data point with you and others because my comment and my script was at least, we feel very, very confident about our upcoming \u2013 we\u2019re into it now. Our seasonal ramp here with Hill Phoenix in the second and third quarters. We see some nice things happening at this business. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : So, does that mean that some of these retail projects that have been pushed, that were pushed in the second half of the year, are coming through. And what does that \u2013 is there a read here for the board of U.S. economy in your view? Bob Livingston : Well, I would, if you wanted a read on the U.S. economy across the Dover business profile, I would probably point more to our industrial businesses rather than the retail grocery activity. Your comment, your question here about some of the project referrals, Nigel, these were fairly modest, I\u2019m talking $7 million, $8 million or $9 million of business activity that we would have expected in the first quarter has been shifted to either second or third quarter, it\u2019s actually a rather modest number. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay, okay. And then just wanted to come back to the comment on fluids margins of 20% plus acquisitions, I believe that 1Q seems to be your lowest margin quarter from your perspective 1Q and 4Q, the 2Q, 3Q better. So, I\u2019m actually wondering? Bob Livingston : I could work with that. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Yeah. Once we get beyond this M&A dilution, can you think the 20% plus is a good run rate for maybe 3Q, 4Q? Bob Livingston : Well, I think I\u2019ve even commented on this in the January call Nigel, when we gave our initial guidance. We still have, we still have a target for the year of about 18% margins. The second half is going to be stronger than the first half, the first half is truly taking some of the, I call it the headwind from the early days and the integration cost of some of our recent acquisitions. But it\u2019s also carrying some of the weight of a couple or three large I call them productivity projects that we\u2019ve launched in the second half of last year. And are really in, I call it the execution mode here in the first half. And that\u2019s around Energy being one and refrigeration and food equipment being the second one. But we remain quite confident with our second half outlook on an up-tick in margins. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with Nomura. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura: Good morning, guys. Bob Livingston : Hi, Shannon. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura: Hi, maybe just one quick follow-up on that I mean, on this acquisition impact, I mean, how much of that in the fluid margins is sort of permanent acquisition cost that\u2019s going to just remain in terms of amortization or otherwise, in terms of those GAAP to the 20%? Bob Livingston : Oh my goodness, you\u2019re good again to the detail here. I\u2019m going to have to defer to Brad. Brad shared with you in his comments that absent to the acquisition activity in fluids, operating margins were 20%. I wouldn\u2019t label, I would not label 20% as non-sustainable or unsustainable with respect to the core business. Now, the acquisitions we\u2019ve made out, what is it, four or five in this segment, just in the last nine or actually in the last six months. Each one of them is a little bit different. The profile of each is different and the timeline of moving those recent acquisitions to the point where they are either neutral or perhaps even accretive to second margins, it\u2019s a little bit different. But we did increase obviously. Brad Cerepak : Yeah, so maybe another way to answer because I don\u2019t have that data with me is that, the acquisitions in the first quarter specific to the total company and in fluids was dilutive to our EPS. And as we\u2019ve stepped through the year, it becomes accretive. And you saw on our bridge that we expect to have $0.05 to $0.07 of performance out of those acquisitions. The key point is that, the integration is going to take some time. And I would think in the fluids business, we won\u2019t see the margins come up to more our level or our standard until \u201815. Bob Livingston : Until \u201815, yes. Brad Cerepak : So there will be a drag on those margins through the whole year. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura: Okay. In Printing & ID, I mean, do you have the organic revenue and order numbers for Printing & ID and just also maybe a little color on how you think you\u2019re doing after you\u2019ve kind of reinvested in some of the product portfolio there? Bob Livingston : Okay. Organic for Printing & ID for quarter one was 4%. Actually I would share with you to me the real success story in Printing & ID in the first quarter was Mark Mommage (ph). And now that I share with you that organic growth at Mark Mommage (ph) in the first quarter was quite healthy, 6%. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura: Okay. Bob Livingston : And we were quite pleased to see where it came from. We had some nice road at Mark Mommage (ph) in the first quarter in the U.S. market and the China market as well as South America. We continue to see the strength in Europe that we have seen over the past couple of quarters at Mark Mommage (ph). But the results in the first quarter were really led by China and the U.S. Paul Goldberg : Yes, Shannon, just to be clear. In Printing & ID, the organic growth was 5% in the industrial platform the organic growth was 4%. There was a little bit of lack in there too but that was the pure organic growth numbers. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura: And then, Paul, do you happen to have any order organic number? Paul Goldberg : I don\u2019t have that right now but I\u2019ll have it when we talk later. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura: Okay. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Bob Livingston : Hi Jeff. Brad Cerepak : Hi Jeff. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Bob, I wonder if you could just address kind of managerial bandwidth now on the M&A front. For example, if I think about what\u2019s going on in fluid? Are those guys kind of full up on what they can handle for a year or two or are you still comfortable doing deals in there or should we expect kind of your activity would be oriented somewhere else in the portfolio? Bob Livingston : Well, our pipeline is fairly well spread among the segments. But Jeff, included in our pipeline, we\u2019ve got some deals that we are pursuing in the fluids segment. The acquisition activity were smaller ones, but the acquisition activity in fluids over the last six months or so, have actually been fairly well split between our pumps businesses and our fluid transfer businesses. It\u2019s not all with one management team. And we do have more bandwidth for acquisitions. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : All right. And we should expect you to kind of modulate between share repurchase in deals this year depending on the case at which deals materialize. Is that a fair statement? Bob Livingston : That\u2019s a fair statement. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : And then I guess, finally from me, could you just interest pricing in Hill Phoenix if you said anything I missed it. But with this piece of order activity, is there actually some positive price in the business and to what extent? Bob Livingston : My comment wouldn\u2019t even just be restricted to Hill Phoenix, Jeff. I would tell you that sort of across the board for Dover, I would label pricing as pretty gone neutral. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Okay, neutral overall. Bob Livingston : Neutral overall. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Okay, thank you. Bob Livingston : Including with Hill Phoenix, but if I say if that would be a fairly standard comment that we would use with all four segments. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Okay, thank you, Bob. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Bob Livingston : Hi, John. Brad Cerepak : Good morning, John. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : And by the way, just as a follow-up on the pricing point. Would that apply to the backlog as well, was there any discernible price notation in the backlog within any of the segments or any? Brad Cerepak : No concern on pricing, John. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. Probably mentioned Mark Mommage (ph) in China was good. What moderated in China, because it seems that what\u2019s happening in China, it\u2019s less about macro and it\u2019s more company specific, some better, some are worse. Could you provide a little more color on what you see there? Bob Livingston : I don\u2019t remember this I don\u2019t remember our organic growth rate in China. I know that our all-in growth rate in China was I think 6% for the quarter. Well, still pretty healthy, but for us it\u2019s a bit of moderation. And I would tell you that when we define it as a bit of a moderation we\u2019re going to describe some project shipments on food equipment, especially around some of our can making equipment that was absent in the first quarter. And we saw some nice activity in that business area in 2013. If you look at the other businesses that are quite active for us in China, be it Mark Mommage (ph), be it some of our fluid businesses, activity was pretty solid. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : That makes sense. Bob, I think you were at a conference recently, you mentioned that Energy and refrigeration could outperform your organic growth targets. The Energy makes sense but what about refrigeration, I realize you made earlier comments this call, that you see a better sort of line of sight to improvement as the year progresses. But we are down sort of, we have a pretty low start for the year. Can you just maybe add to why \u2013 what\u2019s your confidence there? Bob Livingston : Okay. Well, don\u2019t \u2013 I would caution you to not overreact to a negative revenue comp number for the first quarter for this segment, we\u2019ve seen that before. And that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not unusual. The \u2013 I look at energy and I see the rig count and drilling activity, especially in the U.S. being a little bit healthier and stronger than we had embedded in our forecast and our guidance in the beginning of the year. And that gives me a little bit of confidence that maybe there is a tailwind against behind our forecast for the year there than we had believed was there at the beginning of the year. And our refrigeration and food equipment segment, I\u2019m going to tell you just, let\u2019s see how the second quarter unfolds here. We are watching pretty closely our order rates. And I\u2019ll repeat myself, I feel very bullish on their opportunities for 2014. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Yes, that\u2019s fair. One final one from me, the drivers of energy, globally seemed pretty good artificial lift, Middle East, the well count that you described. I think actually there is a perception that your Energy margins, admittedly are sure very robust and very healthy but they\u2019re not, they just don\u2019t have a ton of upside. Why again is that the case, if you\u2019ve got really solid organic growth coming through, is it \u2013 just remind us as next is it reinvestment back into the business, because I know you\u2019re restructuring it nor as to get some cost benefit? Why just big picture, Bob or Brad, your Energy margins is not going higher over it\u2019s not? Bob Livingston : Brad could probably give you a more detailed response that I\u2019m prepared to give you. But I think we\u2019ve been sharing this message around margins with the Energy business for goodness, at least 18 months now that we\u2019ve got plenty of opportunity and we pursue these opportunities to increase our operating margins within the segment at the individual businesses. We will see some noise from quarter to quarter or from period to period based upon product mix. But we continue to have opportunities to increase the margins. We are flowing a significant part of that margin improvement back into, I call it people investment and geographic growth initiatives within Energy. And John, you\u2019ll see us continue to do that for the next couple of years. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. Thanks very much guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel: Good morning, Bob, Brad, Paul. Bob Livingston : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Hi Nathan. Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel: If we could go back to I think Bob in your prepared remarks you talked about new product releases in food equipment. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us some more color on what they are \u2013 what the timing of that\u2019s likely to be and when you think will have a positive impact on results? Bob Livingston : Within unified brands, again this is it, the food equipment space, not in the refrigeration space, within unified brands, we\u2019ve got two that I \u2013 two different product launches I can think of sitting here that roll out this year that are both for the fast food restaurant activity. And on I would tell you, one of them we\u2019ve actually \u2013 we actually believe we\u2019d want a $12 million order placement, it won\u2019t flow through this year but will see the beginning of this order flow here in the second half. And it\u2019s a pretty positive impact on unified brands. Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel: Great. And just on the productive projects that you talked about in Energy and food equipment, is there any quantification you can give us for that? And is this something that would be unusually large endeavor or is this just something that it\u2019s part of their regular cause of doing business actually? Bob Livingston : Well, I wouldn\u2019t label the benefit of the projects to be unusually large for us. The projects themselves were probably a little bit larger in scope than what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. But I think I\u2019ve shared this at least on one or two other calls, here in recent quarters. And one of the big projects was a new facility construction in the Houston area for our energy segment that will be the primary location for one of the businesses in Energy. But it will also, it will also house the Houston operations of three or four other Dover businesses. And the project, by the time we finish it, we end up reducing roof count in the area I think by four or five roof counts. We\u2019ve done a similar project with in refrigeration especially around Hill Phoenix. And again a large building project in the Atlantic area. It\u2019s complete we\u2019re starting to occupy the facility now. And when the project is complete it will be the primary location for the systems business of Hill Phoenix, the East Coast operations for Anthony and the assured Roman headquarters for one of the other businesses in that segment. Again the project scope on both of them is a little bit larger than we typically see within Dover, the benefits I don\u2019t remember the exact benefits on both of them. But we\u2019re looking at I think in the range of $2 million to $3 million, $4 million of annual benefits on each of the projects. Nathan Jones \u2013 Stifel: Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets. Bob Livingston : Good morning. Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Good morning, thanks. Just on Energy, maybe you can just talk about, you talked about the large order last year in 1Q. Are there other orders that we should think about that happened in 2013 as we looked at the comps? And Bob, I think you talked about the potential for some large orders in Australia, I mean, at some point this year, maybe your confidence there as well? Bob Livingston : This question is specific to the energy segment? Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Correct. Bob Livingston : Okay. So, Brad commented on the large order we had for Australia that we booked in the first quarter of last year. And Brad, you\u2019re going to have to help me. I think that order in the first quarter of last year was $60 million. But there was a second order last year for the Australian lift project that I think occurred like July, third quarter activity. I have to confess, I really don\u2019t remember the size of that order but I think it was about $40 million. And if you look at the activity for 2014, specific to this \u2013 for this Australian project, the next large order award is anticipated to be made in the latter part of this year. We think it\u2019s going to be in the fourth quarter. And we were \u2013 we think our performance is well and some of the people investments we\u2019ve made here in the first quarter have continued to position us quite well to continue to serve that customer. Brad Cerepak : Yes. I would just add to that, just an observation that the orders are lumpy but the sales are very steady. Bob Livingston : That\u2019s true. Brad Cerepak : For sure, yes. Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Thanks. And then, maybe just a follow-on with capital allocation, I think you mentioned that there could be some balance between buyback and M&A. Is that going to be more opportunistic or should we expect kind of an ongoing program with buyback? Bob Livingston : Yes, okay. Look, I think we\u2019d probably give you a little bit more definitive guidance here on share repurchase activity as we get through the second quarter, understand how the pipeline or acquisition pipeline will develop and execute this year. But don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that we do have an open and outstanding share repurchase authorization as we sit here today. We did complete the $1 billion program in the first quarter. But our open authorization as we sit here today is just a shade under 4 million shares. You\u2019ll see us use that during the year to keep the existing share count flat if not tweak it down a bit. But that\u2019s how we normally manage that. Anything beyond that activity, I think you\u2019ve got to wait for us to see how the acquisition pipeline develops over the next three or four months. Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Thanks. And that\u2019s not \u2013 you\u2019re not assuming future buybacks on the guidance correct? Bob Livingston : Correct. We are not assuming future buybacks. We do know how the weighted average will flow through the year. We\u2019ll naturally take down the share count throughout the year, having completed the $1 billion buyback in the first quarter. That\u2019s just simple averaging. Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady with BMO Capital Markets. Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Hi, good morning guys. Bob Livingston : Hi, Charlie. Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : I don\u2019t know if I missed or not, but on the Energy side, did you give the bookings broken out by the drilling production and the bearings business? Bob Livingston : No, we did not give that. And my goodness, don\u2019t ask me for that, I don\u2019t have. Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay, fair enough. It\u2019s some on the fluids business, I mean, in your prepared remarks you talked about some of the growth opportunities and expansion that was going on. It sounded as though that was a fairly significant focus, I mean, maybe more than it\u2019s been previously to my recollection. Is that \u2013 are you focusing on organic there or is that going to be primarily done by M&A or is it split fairly even? Bob Livingston : No, the comment that I had in my closing remarks about the focus on growing fluids significant growth outside of Europe and North America, that comment is based upon our existing product portfolios, within that segment today. Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Bob Livingston : And keep in mind that the five acquisitions we did in that space are all international deals that we did and we completed that. Brad Cerepak : And a key part of this. Bob Livingston : And a key part of our drive for more international growth. Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay. And then just, one more on your comment on M&A. Can you just remind us when you would find small, medium sized deals kind of what range you\u2019re looking at within those buckets? Brad Cerepak : Well, let\u2019s just put it this way. I would define the top end of a medium sized deal could be $250 million or $300 million. Charlie Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Great. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi. Deane Dray \u2013 Citi: Thank you, good morning everyone. Bob Livingston : Hi Deane. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Deane Dray \u2013 Citi: In the following the no-spin, can you comment on any stranded cost and then what are you thinking about in terms of any other portfolio cleanups that might be next in priority? Brad Cerepak : Okay. Let me take the first one. Bob Livingston : Brad can handle stranded cost. Brad Cerepak : Well, we\u2019ve commented on this in the past. And I would say, we estimated overhead or to stranded cost to be in the range of somewhere between $20 million and $25 million. We have ongoing efforts to take out cost. But what we\u2019ve said was that some of those costs relate to the very sizable resources we have internationally that we intend to retail even though the Knowles was broadly international, we will continue to keep those resources in places we want to grow into more into international and grow into the overhead. So the way we think about it is, our goal is to take out about $10 million of those stranded cost. And I think we\u2019re well on our way of doing that. Deane Dray \u2013 Citi: And then for other portfolio cleanups? Bob Livingston : Look, we\u2019re looking to get the closing here by the end of this quarter or during the second quarter on the sale of our deck business in the U.K. Beyond that we have no processes on divestiture underway. But Deane, it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s an ongoing discussion with \u2013 here with the management team as well as with the board over the next couple or three years, I think it would be normal and expected to see us continue to narrow the scope of Dover. But don\u2019t expect me, but we have nothing underway at this moment. Deane Dray \u2013 Citi: Great. And just last one from me is, if you go back to the Energy side, I don\u2019t mean to pile on. But just to comment about the increase in rig count expectations. And that just brings up this mist that still persists at Dover that you\u2019re so tied to rig count. And it seems as though the industry has changed to where you should be publishing more on wells per rig. But Bob, maybe you just address that? Bob Livingston : Yes, the wells per rig, is \u2013 well completion is actually the better statistic and metric especially around artificial lift Deane. For the drilling activity, rig count is still a good number to look at for drilling activity. But for artificial lift and production it is more around well completion. The well is completed per rig. We are going to see some variation on that depending upon the basins that you\u2019re looking at here in North America. But it still to us is an indicator of the activity that\u2019s going on in the North American Energy space. Deane Dray \u2013 Citi: Great. Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Walter Liptak with Global Hunter. Bob Livingston : Good morning. Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter : Hi, thanks and good morning guys. I wonder listening to the call, everything sounds pretty positive across the board, Printing, fluids, refrigeration and Energy. And I just wanted to get a little bit more color on your view for guidance and why you didn\u2019t at least take up the low end of guidance or what could go wrong in 2014 that you\u2019re concerned about? Bob Livingston : You\u2019re asking me why I didn\u2019t take guidance up? Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter : Yes. Bob Livingston : I\u2019d actually like to get through the bulk of the second quarter before we actually have a real serious discussion internally about it. I\u2019d like to see what the order rates are for April and May. I will tell you that we look at a range of $460 million to $480 million. Folks, I\u2019ll tell you what, we\u2019re focused on, we\u2019re focused on the top-end of that range, not the mid-part of that range. The bottom end of our range, yeah, we could, I\u2019ll plead guilty to that that we could have \u2013 we could have had a very serious discussion about increasing the bottom end of the range. But again, I\u2019m going to say, let us get through and see at least what order activity is for April and May, we\u2019ll have another discussion on that at the end of the quarter or on the July 12. Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter : Okay, good. That\u2019s very good to hear. Bob Livingston : But I\u2019ll tell you, I\u2019ll tell you again, what we\u2019re focused on. That\u2019s the top end of our range. Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter : Okay. If I can just do a follow-up on the Energy, I didn\u2019t hear you talk about how it trended through the quarter, January, February, March. Usually when this market picks up, I think it can pick up a little bit quicker. I wonder if you could just comment on that? Bob Livingston : I don\u2019t have that data here in front of me. But my recall is that it was fairly consistent through the quarter for Energy. Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter : Okay. And maybe just a last one, the winch market being down a little bit, is there anything wrong with that market or is it just timing and orders? Bob Livingston : It\u2019s \u2013 look, it\u2019s timing of orders. And what I call the oil field patch. But we also continue to deal with a headwind. You go back two years ago and my goodness, 30% or 40% of this business was supplying winches into the \u2013 for the military. And we continue to see that part of the business activity decline we\u2019re going to see another significant decline end of this year. But it will decline to the point in 2014 where, if it declines any further in \u201815 is not a comment. I mean, that\u2019s all I can tell you. Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter : Okay. Bob Livingston : It\u2019s getting down to some nits and gnash in the military business on that business. Walter Liptak \u2013 Global Hunter : Okay, good. All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : Thanks Jackie. Once again, we thank you for joining us on our conference call. And we look forward to speaking to you with our second quarter results. Have a good day and a good weekend. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s first quarter 2014 Dover Corporation earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. I was pleased with our second quarter results, which were highlighted by solid revenue and strong bookings growth, reflecting the continued momentum across the majority of our businesses. Most notably, Fluids delivered 12% growth and Engineered Systems grew 9%. In all, we generated 6% revenue growth and grew EPS 14%. From a geographic perspective, U.S., Europe and Asia all showed solid organic growth year-over-year. Conversely, Latin America and Brazil activity was softer over that same period. Now, let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, we continued to benefit from improving well activity and an increased rig count, primarily in our core production and drilling markets. Our bearings and compression revenue was impacted by lower OEM build rates. However, bookings were quite strong, setting us up well for the balance of the year. Within Engineered Systems, we saw strong growth across both platforms. In Printing and Identification growth in both our fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets complemented by acquisitions, resulted in strong performance. The industrial platform also saw broad-based revenue growth led by outstanding results in both environmental solutions and vehicle services.  Our fluid segment performed well, where generally healthy market conditions for both pumps and fluid transfer products complemented by recent acquisitions, resulted in solid revenue growth. Our pumps businesses are benefitting from strong demand and the specialty chemicals vertical while fluid transfer is seeing continued strength driven by increased regulatory activity.  Our refrigeration and food equipment results were generally solid in the second quarter led by strong growth in food equipment. Our quarter two refrigeration results were modestly impacted by the timing of shipments as we completed the transition to our new Atlanta manufacturing center. We expect revenue to accelerate in the third quarter driven by strong bookings and backlog in refrigeration.  In all, we were pleased with the first half and are positioned well to deliver solid full year results. Business activity in our largest markets continues to be strong as evidence by our bookings and backlog. We also continued to execute on our core productivity and growth strategies in the quarter. Notably, we\u2019ve completed the move to our new consolidated manufacturing facilities in Houston and Atlanta. These facilities not only improve manufacturing efficiency, but we also believe our customer service capabilities will be enhanced.  Our acquisition pipeline developed nicely in the quarter. I feel confident we will be able to close several deals that expand our product offerings in served markets, especially within fluids and energy. Regarding our near term business activity, we expect ongoing strong performance in energy, driven by the increased North America well activity, continued growth in Engineered Systems driven by solid U.S industrial trends and global growth in Printing and Identification, strong results in our fluid market on the benefits of our recent acquisitions, and generally healthy end markets and improved sequential results in our refrigeration business. In summary, the combination of a strong first half, robust bookings and a growing backlog and our positioning with customers gives me confidence to raise our full year EPS guidance.  With that, let me turn it over to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today we reported second quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 6%. Organic revenue grew 3% and growth from acquisitions was also 3%. Adjusted EPS was $1.29, an increase of 14%. Segment margin for the quarter was 18.3%, essentially flat with last year. In the quarter we saw margin improvement of 40 basis points in both our energy and refrigeration and food equipment segments. Of note, our overall margin would have been up 40 basis points, adjusting for the impact of acquisitions. Bookings increased 11% over the prior year to $2.1 billion. This result represents broad-based growth across the company highlighted by 26% growth in fluids and 15% growth in energy.  Engineered Systems and refrigeration of food equipment both posted bookings growth of 5%. Overall, book to bill finished at a strong 1.02, which sets us up well for the back half of the year. Our backlog increased significantly in the quarter, up 12% to $1.6 billion.  Free cash flow $154 million for the quarter or 8% of revenue. Free cash flow reflected higher working capital in anticipation of a strong third quarter. For the full year we continue to forecast free cash flow of approximately 11% of revenue.  Now turning to Slide 4, all segments showed organic growth in the quarter. Engineered Systems grew 5% with broad-based growth across both platforms. Energy grew 3% on the continued strength of drilling activity. Fluids & Refrigeration and in food equipment grew 2% and 1% respectively, resulting in overall organic revenue growth of 3%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 3% comprised of 9% in fluids, 4% Engineered Systems and 1% in energy.  Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 9% from the first quarter, where normal seasonal growth of 27% in refrigeration and food equipment was complemented by 8% growth in Engineered Systems. Fluids and energy were both largely unchanged sequentially. Sequential bookings grew 2%, demonstrating continued momentum coming off a strong first quarter. This result was led by 10% growth in refrigeration and food equipment. Fluids grew by 3% and energy was essentially unchanged, whereas Engineered Systems decreased 3%. Overall, the bookings activity was quite positive and positions as well as we begin the second half of the year.  Now on slide 6. Energy revenue of $481 million increased 3% and earnings of $115 million were up 5% over last year. Energy produced another good quarter with solid revenue growth in our drilling and production markets, offsetting softness in our bearings end markets related to OEM build rates. Within drilling and production, growth was driven by improving well activity and the continued strong performance of our drilling businesses. Notably, our core U.S artificial lift business grew sharply and more than offset tough comps related to our largest drilling contract, which is winding down. We believe we\u2019re well positioned for a follow on contract, which is expected to be awarded later this year.  Operating margin of 23.9% improved 40 basis points from last year and was in line with our expectations. Bookings were $477 million, a 15% increase over the prior year reflecting broad-based growth across those segments, driven by generally healthy end markets. Book to bill was 0.99. Now turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems had a strong quarter, with sales of $699 million in earnings of $112 million, each increased 9%. Our Printing & Identification platform increased 15% to $287 million, driven by broad-based organic growth of 6% and recent acquisitions. In the Industrial platform, revenue grew 6% to $412 million, reflecting 5% organic growth. Our environmental solutions and vehicle service activity remains particularly strong in this platform. Margin remained steady at 16.1% with the benefits of ongoing productivity initiatives largely offset product mix and acquisition related costs. Bookings were $692 million, an increase of 5%. Our Printing & Identification bookings increased 9% to $282 million, boosted by recent acquisitions and strong activity in the U.S and in Europe. Industrial bookings increased 3% to $410 million, largely driven by strong orders in our environmental solutions business. Book to bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98 while Industrials was 1. Overall book to bill was 0.99.  Now on Slide 8. Fluids posted another solid quarter where sales increased 12% to $346 million and earnings of $63 million were up 7%. Revenue was driven by organic growth of 2% and acquisition growth of 9%. As previously discussed, our organic growth rate moderated to 2% in the quarter, and now stands at 7% for the first half. This result is tracking well against our full year target. Segment margin was 18.2%, a decrease of 70 basis points from the prior year. Adjusting for recent acquisitions, our core business continues to perform extremely well, with margin of about 20%. We expect overall segment margin to remain in the high teens for the balance of the year, continuing to reflect the impact of recent acquisitions. Bookings were $375 million, an increase of 26% driven by strong project related order activity in the plastics and petrochemical markets, some of which will ship in 2015. Book to bill was 1.08.  Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration and food equipment generated revenue of $522 million, up 1% over the prior year and earning increased 3% to $85 million. Strong revenue performance in food equipment was partially offset by softer Latin American refrigeration markets and the impact related to the completion of the transition to our new Atlanta manufacturing center. We entered the second half with a strong refrigeration backlog, up 16% over the prior year and expect strong shipments in the third quarter. Operating margin increased 40 basis points to 16.3%. This result primarily reflects productivity gains and a favorable product mix. Bookings were strong at $543 million, an increase of 5%, principally reflecting strong demand for refrigeration products. Book to bill was 1.04.  Now moving to the overview on Slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $32 million, up $2 million from last year and in line with expectations. Corporate expense decreased $6 million to $29 million as expected and generally consistent with Q1. Our second quarter tax rate was 30.8%. Capital expenditures were $44 million in the quarter. Lastly, we repurchased 290,000 shares for $25 million in the quarter. Now moving to Slide 11 which shows our full year guidance. We expect 2014 organic revenue growth to be around 4% at the high end of our previous range. We expect energy to be roughly 5%, the high end of the prior range driven by strong North American market dynamics. Engineered Systems organic revenue was forecast to be up one point to 4% to 5% based on their strong Printing and Identification business and improved U.S Industrial activity. Refrigeration and food equipment is anticipated to have approximately 1% to 2% organic growth, reflecting a one point reduction from our prior forecast, primarily driven by a weaker Latin America. Our fluids organic revenue forecast remains unchanged. Completed acquisitions will add 3%.  In total we expect full year revenue growth to be near the high end of our 6% to 7% range. Segment margin is still expected to be around 18%. Corporate expense is forecasted at $125 million. Interest expense remains at $133 million. Our full year tax rate is estimated to be about 31%. CapEx should be approximately 2.5% of revenue and we expect our 2014 free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue. Now turning to the bridge on Slide 12. We have raised the bottom and top end of our EPS range to reflect our current view. We now see volume pricing mix contributing $0.26 to $0.33. Productivity will add $0.17 to $0.21 while investment and compensation will have an $0.18 to $0.22 impact. All other categories are either unchanged or reflect minor revisions. In total we now expect 2014 EPS to be $4.75 to $4.85. This represents 11% growth at the mid-point. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts. Bob Livingston : Thanks Brad. Overall, I am pleased with our first half performance. We delivered solid revenue and earnings growth and also saw strong order activity. We are executing well and are well positioned for continued success driven by strong dynamics in each segment. Within energy we expect a strong growth in North American well activity to continue. This growth, combined with our global initiatives, including the potential for additional Australian project business, positions us very well into the second half of the year and beyond. In Engineered Systems, growing global applications for our printing and identification technology, including the emerging textile market provides higher growth opportunities. Within our industrial markets, our customers\u2019 desire for productivity solutions, offer significant growth prospects. Within Fluids, increasing regulations regarding vapor recovery and the safe transport of chemicals and fuels affords a strong business climate for our fluid transfer businesses. Additionally our pumps business is benefiting from strong plastics and petrol chemical markets.  Finally, in refrigeration and food equipment, we continue to focus on the ongoing needs of our customers for productivity and energy efficient solutions. In addition, we\u2019re continually working to help them drive same store sales growth through our innovative merchandising systems. We expect to outperform market again, driven by market leading products and solutions. In all, the future remains extremely bright for Dover and I am very confident about our positioning and long-term growth prospects. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results.  With that Paul, let\u2019s take a few questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks. Before we put on the first question Laurie, I just want to remind everyone if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow up, we\u2019ll be better able to serve all the analysts out there. So Laurie, what is our first question? Operator : (Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Banc of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch : Sure. So question on the quarter. As I think about margin expansion opportunities for the year, energy bookings were nice. Fluids were really nice. You actually showed margin expansion in energy, and if you exclude M&A, fluids were very strong. So, what's the opportunity, and why are we still being conservative? What's the big headwind that we should worry about in the second half? Bob Livingston : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Obin \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch : Morning. Bob Livingston : Your specific question is what should we be concerned about with respect to productivity and margins in the second half or was it \u2026? Andrew Obin \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. I guess the question is, if I look at the strong book-to-bill, if I look at the fact that (inaudible) -- for the second half of the year on margin. Bob Livingston : I think the guidance or the comment that Brad shared with you that margins for the year we still look to them to be about 18%, I actually feel pretty darn comfortable with that about 18% number. That doesn\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not going to sit here and give you a specific guidance that it\u2019s 17.9% or 18.1%, but right now we feel pretty darn comfortable with the 18% number. The growth rate in the second half, organic growth rate for Dover overall should be up a bit versus the first half. We are seeing some pretty positive dynamics across the board in all four segments. Goodness, we could revisit each one of the segments and talk about it, but I think we sit here and look at the second half and feel like it\u2019s strongly within our grasp to just execute. Brad Cerepak : I guess what I would add, Andrew, is that our first half margin performance into the second half sequentially is going to improve for sure. As we talked about first quarter, we go back to the first quarter, acquisitions impact is about 70 basis points. This quarter it\u2019s about 40 basis points. That starts to diminish as we continue to integrate and bring them on board through the second half where the full year impact is around 30 to 40 basis points. You will see that margin rate first half to second half sequentially improve for us. Andrew Obin \u2013 Banc of America Merrill Lynch : And just a follow up question on acquisition pipeline development, you started out the year talking about $500 million to $1 billion. Then you dialed it down. Now you guys are talking about M&A opportunities as well, but what\u2019s the reasonable outcome for the year right now and I guess any color beyond that? Thank you. Bob Livingston : Yeah, you\u2019re right. I opened the year with a little bit of guidance saying $500 million to $1billion in acquisition spend. I think it was -- by the time we got into April and May, I was sharing with you that that number could be closer to $500 million than a $1billion. Without sounding too positive, I would tell you today on an update that it's probably closer to the midpoint. Yeah, it's always difficult to predict an acquisition until we actually close on it. The profile hasn\u2019t changed any from what I've shared with the analysts and investors earlier. There\u2019s nothing that I would label as large in our pipeline. Anything from as small as $10 million to $400 million, that\u2019s there we are. Operator : Your next question comes in the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Just wanted to get a little granularity on Printing and ID. That was a business that was a bit of a soft spot for you a while and now you've bounced back the last couple quarters. It looks like you gained a fair amount of share this quarter based on at least what your competitor -- main competitor is putting out there. How is -- give us a little sense of the sustainability of this. When I think about it, you're in a share loss position. You came back with some new product. You gained share back. Is this a one-time step-up where you're kind of back in the game, if you will, and then that more normalizes with industry growth or is this something bigger than that? Bob Livingston : Scott, let me correct a couple of statements first. Davis \u2013 Barclays: Please do. Bob Livingston : I actually think we\u2019ve been back on the game to quote your phrase, for more than just a couple of quarters. I think you can go back over, perhaps the last \u2013 at least the last four or five quarters and see the building momentum within that business. They\u2019ve had -- Markem Imaje had another great second quarter. Actually I think they had a great first half. I think they\u2019ve had a very, very strong last four quarters. Organic growth for MI in the second quarter, Brad was 8%? Brad Cerepak : 8% Bob Livingston : Okay. It was fairly broad-based. I would point and I think Brad commented on this with respect to refrigeration and I commented on it in my opening comments. All of Latin and South America has been rather soft here in the second quarter across the board for Dover. That didn\u2019t escape MI, Markem Imaje as well. But when you look at our activity in the U.S, our activity in Europe and in Asia, the team is doing quite well. I think it's sustainable. We\u2019re showing very strong positive organic growth for the second half of the year. We\u2019ve got new products being launched in the second half of the year as well. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. Fair enough. So, this is a little bit of a -- my follow-up is a little bit of a political hot cake. When I think about companies that, like yours, that have relatively high tax rates it's not crazy, but 30% plus is higher than the average in the group. Bob Livingston : Yeah. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Would you consider an inversion? Has there been any thought of doing something internationally? Because there are some potential targets out there, of course, that could potentially make sense for you guys also and the added benefit of tax would certainly make it more attractive. Bob Livingston : I don\u2019t want to say never ever but it clearly isn\u2019t in our planning or thinking as we sit here today. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you. Brad Cerepak : Scott, back to the tax rate, we\u2019ve said that we look at our taxes because of our geo mix. As we become more global, we do see a path to below 30%. And that\u2019s where we currently still believe we can get to. We\u2019ll continue to see the benefits of for instance the Markem Imaje growth is very global and it has a lower tax rate associated with it. So I do think we\u2019ll get below 30%. I think we said that by 2016. Bob Livingston : And a fair amount of our acquisition spend over the last 18 months has been outside of the U.S. I think seven of our last 10 or 11 acquisitions have been outside of the US. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : : Bob Livingston : Technically, no. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. That\u2019s all I was really asking. So, thank you guys. Good luck. Congrats on a good quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : I was wondering if we could just talk about energy margins a little bit more. They were up year over year, but last year was depressed. I actually would have thought with a surge in drilling and production in the U.S that would be very mix positive and your margins are actually down sequentially on flat slightly up revenues sequentially. So is there something with mixer investment or something else going on in there? Bob Livingston : I don\u2019t think there is anything different going on. We continue and I think I\u2019ve commented on this at least once this year -- we continue to make our investments for supporting our geo mix, growth especially in the Middle East and in Southeast Asia and in Australia. We are at a low point rate now in our Australia activity with respect to energy Low point in sales ... Brad Cerepak : Low point in sales and high -- and the cost that\u2019s still there for the next ... Bob Livingston : Yeah, the cost is there. So, that has a little bit of weight on the margins. But Jeff, I would tell you that we ended last year and energy with margins of 24.8%. And I think my comment a couple of times last year is I happened to like that number and I believe that\u2019s about where we are going to end 2014, is about 24.8%. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Would that imply Bob, that there actually is upside in that number and you\u2019re spending it away because at this margin level you\u2019d obviously prefer growth over margin? Or do you think you are at some natural ceiling in that business? Bob Livingston : We are -- I would tell you that -- again I\u2019m going to repeat myself with respect to the investment that we are making and our geo mix initiatives as well as the near term carrying cost of what we are doing in Australia, has some pressure on the margins. Some of it also has to do with some of the recent acquisitions Jeff. Every acquisition we make in energy doesn\u2019t come out of the gate with 25% operating margins. Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Right, and then just finally move on. Someone else this morning indicated a broad-based \u201cfade\u201d in activity in Europe in June. Did you guys see anything like that? Bob Livingston : Broad-based what? Fade ... Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Fade. Bob Livingston : Fade of bookings or activity. Bob Livingston : No. I would say our activity in Europe was again pretty solid across the board for Dover businesses. Generally speaking June was the best month for us in the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Bob and Brad, so I guess Domino called out -- I know you sort of indirectly referenced this, but, they did call out difficult product ID in Asia. What do you -- what's your sense of market conditions in Dover's performance and product ID in Asia? And, maybe you could talk a little bit about what your -- are you looking to do M&A there, or build the presence? Bob Livingston : Specific to product ID? John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Yes, please. Bob Livingston : Was that the question? We continue to see growth in Asia both organic as well as what we are reporting as acquisition activity, John. The recent acquisition we made earlier in the year of MS Printing does -- they do ship a fair amount of their systems into Asia. That said I will tell that the growth rate, the activity for Markem Imaje, specific to Markem Imaje, the activity in China specifically was not as strong in the second quarter as perhaps what we\u2019ve seen over the last two or three quarters. But I think I have signaled that a couple of times here in the last two or three months. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : No, I think you have. Any of your other businesses, Bob, inflected in China, either more positively of more negatively that you saw in the quarter? Bob Livingston : Well, when you look at the number for Dover for China, to get a real sense of that, you\u2019ve sort of got to pull out the lumpiness that we do experience in our food equipment business specific to Belvac and their project shipments into China. But I think all in for China, what was our growth rate? It was mid-teens in China for the second quarter. Brad Cerepak : Which included a large Belvac. Bob Livingston : But it did include a Belvac shipment. Brad Cerepak : So I think adjusting for that John \u2026 Bob Livingston : I\u2019m not -- let me give you a highlight. I\u2019m not concerned about our activity in China. I know there\u2019s been a little bit of a slowdown that we\u2019ve all been experiencing in China over the past couple or three quarters. I don\u2019t label it as a problem. It has been a little bit -- for the core activities, it\u2019s been a little bit slower in the second quarter than perhaps it was a year ago. But our businesses are doing quite well in China. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Yeah. And then my follow up, Bob, it really is to the energy business you\u2019re putting investment spending into international artificial lift market. Middle East is a source of growth. My question is this turmoil that we\u2019ve seen in the Middle East, has that in any way impacted sort of what your customers have said with respect to project disbursements and spending? I realize your business is not centered in Iraq or Syria or any of those places. But I\u2019m just wondering about the implications of what you\u2019re hearing and does it cause you perhaps to sort of think about modifying your pace of investment spending, either more forcefully or less forcefully in the region for the energy businesses? Bob Livingston : Okay, so let me respond to activity. Your first part was activity in the Middle East. Our activity there continues to expand. Perhaps, I don\u2019t have this exact comparison, but my sense is John that our activity in the Middle East is probably at pace or a bit ahead of pace of our investment rate of change in the Middle East. The second part of your question was with respect to customers. It\u2019s interesting that when you\u2019ve read the headlines over the last three or four months with respect to some of the larger oil and gas customers pulling back from either the Middle East or maybe some larger projects around the world and a little bit more focus per se on the opportunities in North America, I think we\u2019ve seen that. On one data point we\u2019d seen that with respect to the increased rig count and well activity here this year. But that whole backing CapEx, I will tell you I happen to think it\u2019s a little bit of the phenomenon behind the slowness or the deferrals we\u2019ve seen in our bearings and compression business activity. Operator : The next question comes to the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : So just wanted to \u2013 Brad I think you called out that obviously you have pretty good strength in the fluids backlog, but some of that backlog converts in \u201815. So I\u2019m just wondering are we seeing a change in mix between maybe some large projects coming through there and perhaps you can give some color on that, Brad? Bob Livingston : I know -- this is Bob and I know that part of our backlog in fluids is dated into \u201815 and it\u2019s really related to a couple of our more recent acquisitions, the MOG acquisition that was completed about two years ago and then the Finder acquisition that was completed last fall, which are more systems type of businesses rather than distributed product. Is there a change in our profile? Other than that I\u2019m going to say no. The fluid for the segment organic growth in the second quarter was obviously less than it was in the first quarter and I think when we reported first quarter results we clearly indicated that we had some projects that were shipped in the first quarter, that as we opened the year we actually had them planed for shipment in early second quarter and at customer request we pulled them forward. Organic growth for fluids in the first half was 7%, I think we are going to be real close to that organic growth rate, maybe a little bit less in the second half. We will always see a little bit of the lumpiness due to the project nature of the business model we have at MOG and at Finder. Both businesses are doing well with the customers and both businesses are growing. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Great. And then, just turning back to the M&A backlog, you started the year with that range, and then you sort of went below that range and now you're moving back to the midpoint. I'm just wondering, what's happened in the last two months? Are we starting to see more willing sellers coming through, or am I just overthinking this? Bob Livingston : I think you may be overthinking it, Nigel. We can define a pipeline and Brad and I, internally we review this weekly what our status is and status changes. I would tell you that we are moving forward on an acquisition opportunity today that three months ago I would have told you it\u2019s probably not going to happen until 2015. It\u2019s not a new target. It\u2019s not something that represents a change in our attitude or our pricing discipline. The position with the target changed a bit. So just don\u2019t over think that. I still feel comfortable with the range that I opened the year with, the $500 million to $1 billion. And as I said earlier in the call, maybe today we are closer to that midpoint in that range. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. That's very helpful, Bob. And, just quickly, just to clarify a certain point. Any ambition to move outside of your defined growth areas? So obviously, fluids and NG, refrigeration, PID have been sort of your sort of growth avenues, but any desire to maybe add one or two other growth avenues going forward, maybe Greenfield? Bob Livingston : I don\u2019t think you are going to see us do that in the next year or two, Nigel. I think what you do see and we\u2019ve been -- I think we\u2019ve been illustrating this for the past couple of years now and these primary growth spaces that we\u2019ve focused on we continue to push into new adjacencies and to grow our market space and to grow and increase the size of the available market that we can play in. And we think we can have plenty of opportunity to continue to do that for the next couple of years. Operator : (Operator Instruction) Your next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: First question is how much of the bookings number is acquired bookings from acquisitions of the 11%? Bob Livingston : Yeah. I don\u2019t have dollar number. I can give you a data point here though. On the second quarter bookings organic growth, the total growth of 11% of that organic was 7.5%. Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Okay, great. And, on the guidance, as I sort of look at what you changed and walked through, it seems like you're looking at something like 33% incremental on the additional volume growth. And then, it looks like investment and compensation improved by $0.01, and productivity tightened up a little bit as well. Am I reading that correctly in terms of how you're thinking about it? And then, on the investment comp side, what was improving and on the productivity side, what changed? Bob Livingston : There\u2019s a lot in that question. Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: I'm only allowed two. Bob Livingston : The second quarter conversion rate ex acquisition was very, very positive, no doubt about it coming off of first quarter which was reasonably good as well. We are still thinking that the full year conversion on all the volume is in that range of 27% to 28%. So yeah, the incremental is a little bit -- the mix gives you a little bit of stronger conversion. As it relates to changes in the bridge, again I think we\u2019re just typing up a little bit on the volume and the mix. As far as productivity we continue to put considerable focus in this area in order to continue to drive performance and be able to make the investments we\u2019re looking to make. I\u2019d say sitting here today we feel very good about the progress we\u2019ve made on productivity. We\u2019ve got a lot of projects underway that will drive incremental gross productivity for us that\u2019s slightly better than we anticipated early in the year. As far as compensation, I\u2019d say that\u2019s just normal activity or true ups of where we think we\u2019ll be for the year in the compensation. Brad Cerepak : Nothing unusual? Bob Livingston : Nothing unusual. Steve Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Okay, great. One follow-up on the productivity side, though. The refrigeration plant move, did you run those plants in parallel? Or, did you do a hard turnover that drove the revenue decline? Bob Livingston : There was a little overlap and the revenue declined. As we said the decline is just a deferral to the third quarter. We didn\u2019t lose any customer orders or anything in our bookings or backlog. It\u2019s in the backlog in essence. It\u2019s about $10 million or so of sales that will move into the third quarter. We had a little overlap of cost both in Houston and both in Atlanta and I\u2019d say that overlap of cost would cost us about a penny in the quarter in total for both of those facilities. But that will diminish now or go to zero in the third quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan of RBC Capital. Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe just one on the industrial business. You've had some decent organic growth there the last couple of quarters. Maybe you could just talk about where you're seeing the strength in ESG, VSG and maybe how you see the sustainability of those end markets? Bob Livingston : Okay. You\u2019re right. As we commented in the earlier part of the call in the industrial platform, we saw some outstanding activity. We\u2019ve seen it for the year. Actually I would say that this is not new. We\u2019ve been \u2013 these two business areas have been performing quite well over the last I would say at least 12 months, if not 18 months. And we see it continuing in the second half and these two businesses are very well positioned in their marketplace and with their customers. We see that being quite sustainable. Jamie Sullivan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay, thanks. And then, just a follow-up on the free cash flow targets, your confidence there given where you are in the first half, should we just look at it as a normal seasonal pattern, or is there an additional weighting this year toward the second half versus normal? Bob Livingston : I\u2019d say it\u2019s mostly the same sessional pattern. But if I look at the second quarter the performance was okay, maybe a little bit lower than what we were looking for. But as I said earlier, June was our best month in the quarter and the teams have really \u2013 we\u2019re setup nicely now in going into the third quarter so there\u2019s a little bit of carry of working capital. So, on the edges maybe the second half is a little bit higher than we would have expected to going into the year. Brad Cerepak : But we still feel very comfortable with the 11% target. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: On the refrigeration business, even with the deferral, can you just maybe talk about -- or if you ex out the deferral, could you just talk about what you're seeing from just maybe segment the customers from the Big-Box guys to the more local customers on that front? Bob Livingston : Okay. This question -- my answer is going to be more specific and I think you question is to Hill Phoenix. First of all on the big customers, without sharing information on an individual customer, I\u2019ll say the big two that we\u2019ve talked about over the last couple of years, Wal-Mart and Target, we\u2019ve got a little bit of headwind that we\u2019re dealing with this year. Most of that has actually occurred in the first half. When you look beyond the big two and look at the regional retailers, that activity has been up for us. We\u2019ve seen it in all parts of the business, be it the cases, be it the doors as well as our refrigeration systems. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Got you. And then, just a follow-up --. Bob Livingston : Steve, I could give you another color point on that. If we have any concern right now relative to where we were coming into the year, I'm going to bring you back to my comments earlier about the softness we\u2019ve seen in Latin America and South America. I don\u2019t know the exact number, but I want to say it was probably somewhere in the $11 million $15 million range for the first half. Revenue expectations in Latin America and South America were that much softer than we anticipated. And sitting here today, I will tell you that we aren\u2019t planning for a recovery or a rebound in Latin America or South America in 2014. That recovery is not in our numbers. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: And that's core Hill Phoenix as opposed to Anthony? Bob Livingston : That one is probably \u2013 That\u2019s Hill Phoenix and Anthony and our after-market services all together. Brad Cerepak : But it's not entirely just that business sponsor Bob is referring. That\u2019s the total company, but I would say Hill Phoenix is probably a bigger part of that softness that we\u2019re talking about. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Right. And then, just a quick update, so your business is down a little bit in the first half. I guess the margin is down a tad there as well for the whole segment. What is -- how is Anthony doing? And, what's the -- just remind me of the revenue base Anthony will represent in 2014? Bob Livingston : Oh my goodness. Let\u2019s see. We track Anthony now as the business unit on doors only. All of the after-market activity of Hill Phoenix and Anthony has been combined into a separate business unit that is now reported under Hill Phoenix. So on doors only, what's the revenue base? $250 million just on doors and \u2013 I call it glass and door frames. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay, and that compares to what in 2013? Bob Livingston : It's up mid-single digits. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay. Bob Livingston : Maybe a little higher than that, yeah. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: And the margins flattish for the segment? Bob Livingston : Okay, that\u2019s something \u2013 you\u2019re going to get some detail now that we don\u2019t release, but we\u2019re happy with the margins. Operator : Our next question comes in the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on refrigeration again because I guess you took down the organic growth guide a little bit for the year, but you had had a very good book-to-bill in Hill Phoenix in Q1. I think you said it was 1.3. And, the plant deferral stuff you'll get back. So, is it really just Latin America suddenly got very bad in the last couple of months in that business? Because you did have a very -- as you said, you did have a very good book-to-bill in three months ago. Bob Livingston : The book-to-bill for Hill Phoenix and for \u2013 especially for Hill Phoenix was very strong in the first quarter as well as it was in the second quarter. It's interesting. Again for Hill Phoenix, because of the way -- I call it the seasonal period builds and runs. That seasonal period being the second and the third quarter combined. Actually you get a better picture when you look at the period rather than the quarters because projects can move from quarter to quarter. If you were to look at the 2014 seasonal period, second and third quarter, versus last year\u2019s seasonal period, I think Hill Phoenix will be up two to three points organically. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Got it. And then, just on -- Bob Livingston : We are expressing some caution around Latin America and South America. And I think that\u2019s what you really see reflected in a little bit of the down take on the organic growth rate for the second. Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse : Thank you. And then, I think just on capital allocation. The last earnings call you talked about maybe giving a buyback update during Q2. I think in the quarter you spent about $25 million on the buyback. Is that a sort of a run rate we should expect, given you sound pretty positive about the M&A pipeline? Bob Livingston : I think you could expect to see that run rate continue in the second half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dean Dray of Citi Research. Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup: I might have missed it, but did you give a specific percentage amount you thought the North American rig count could be trending up for the year? We have been tracking -- it was interesting. In the beginning of the year, it was flattish and then last update, maybe 2%. It sounds like you're a bit more encouraged here. So, do you have a number for that? Bob Livingston : Yeah. We look at -- based upon the first actuals and the second half forecast we see the rig count in the US being up about 6% over 2013. Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup: That's quite a jump. Are you expecting thy share gains in that higher volume or just holding steady there? Bob Livingston : I\u2019m not going to speak to share gains; I would tell you that -- to get a really good feel I probably need to separate some business activity for you, Dean. I\u2019ve commented about our project business in Australia. If you were to separate just \u2013 I\u2019m going to give you some data just on artificial lift, not the segment, but just on artificial lift. If you were to pull out the Australia project business and look at artificial lift without it, the revenue growth in the second quarter was about 8%. Bookings were up about 16%. If you were to look at \u2013 again doing it for the full year that\u2019s embedded in our revised guidance, you would see artificial lift up 15% or 16%. And bookings up \u2013 I\u2019m sorry that would be the bookings about 15% or 16% increase in bookings and low double digit growth in revenue in artificial lift. Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup: That's for the full year? Bob Livingston : That\u2019s for the full year. Activity in North America is pretty strong, Dean taking Australia out. Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup: Yeah. That certainly is reflected there. Then, just a last quick one for me, and it's a blast from the past, but for Brad, are there any stranded costs that will be addressed in Knowles, or is that chapter completely closed? Brad Cerepak : I think that chapter has been pretty well complete. We continued to work on some smaller areas. But as we said in the first quarter I think we brought our corporate cost down quite nicely. We continue to keep the cost associated with the regional centers in the sense of where we\u2019re going to try to grow globally or we are growing globally. I think that chapter is really closed at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charley Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Charley Brady \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Just a quick one on refrigeration. You had touched on a few points of it, but I guess as I look to the -- you answered the question of the revenue outlook for the second half given some moving parts here. But, if I look to the margin, we don't have a headwind from Target and Wal-Mart. We certainly have a great reduction in that. We've got a catch-up from the shipments from 2Q into 3Q. I guess I look out to the margin expectation in the second half, and I guess particularly into Q3, it sounds as though that ought to get a decent tick-up in some of the margin there. But, I guess what I'm really trying to square that up is, how much of a margin headwind does Latin America really give you to offset these other moving parts that otherwise would indicate pretty good margin performance in 2H? Bob Livingston : Okay. So look, there\u2019s more to the segment than just refrigeration. We\u2019ve got a sector we call food equipment. And it\u2019s interesting in the first half of 2014, I think organic growth for food equipment was slightly positive, like two points, even with the headwind we had it in Latin America and here is a point where our position, where we actually see a little bit of a headwind in Eastern Europe and in Russia, but it\u2019s minor. But for this sector, for this little group it\u2019s measurable. The second half of the year we see organic growth in our refrigeration business two or three points, but because of the project activity that I mentioned earlier around Belvac, the second half in food equipment could actually be negative organic growth slightly. And here now is the point on your margins. The food equipment group has higher margins that the refrigeration group does. So what you see in the second half is some increased volume, but you don\u2019t see the margin increments flowing through and it\u2019s all due to product mix between the two sectors. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : We just want to thank everybody again for joining our conference call today and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter to discuss third quarter results. Have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s second quarter 2014 Dover Corporation earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and `have a wonderful day.",

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. I was pleased with our strong finish to the third quarter. As we shared with you a few weeks ago, we did have some pockets of unexpected softness in July and August. However, September business activity was quite strong and exceeded expectations. The overall result was revenue and bookings growth at each segment. Most notably, Fluids delivered 17% growth, while Energy and Engineered Systems each grew 8%. In all, we generated 8% revenue growth and grew EPS 8%. Our 10% bookings growth, coupled with a strong September, sets us up well for the fourth quarter. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., Europe and Asia all had solid organic growth, whereas Canada and Brazil declined year-over-year. Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, we continue to benefit from strong U.S. well activity and an increased rig count, especially in our core production and drilling markets namely the Permian, Eagle Ford and Bakken basins. This activity along with double-digit Middle East growth, more than offset weakness in bearings and winches.  In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid growth across both platforms. Within Printing and Identification we saw growth in both our fast moving consumer goods and industrial markets, especially in the U.S. Also, our recent MS acquisition, which specializes in digital printing for textiles is off to a great start with Dover and contributed 9% growth to the platform. The industrial platform also achieved strong growth, led by outstanding results in our auto-related businesses. Our Fluids segment performed well, where robust market conditions for fluid transfer products, complemented by recent acquisitions, resulted in strong revenue growth. This growth is primarily tied to positive global retail fuming activity, along with tailwinds from emerging fluid transfer safety regulations. Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment revenue was generally solid in the third quarter, but overall results were below our expectations. Refrigeration revenue, while positive, was impacted by the timing of shipments to a major retailer, specifically in Mexico and small store formats in the U.S. We expect to deliver the bulk of these push-outs in the fourth quarter. We have made great strides in strengthening our company in 2014. We have completed a number of productivity initiatives across the organization and have enhanced several of our businesses via acquisition, including our recently completed Accelerated transaction. Accelerated brings ESP technology, one of the fastest growing product categories in North America Artificial Lift. In total, we have invested roughly $800 million on acquisitions year to date. As a result, we\u2019ve expanded our global footprint in Fluid Transfer, opened new markets for our Printing and Identification business and we have significantly broadened our product offerings in Artificial Lift. Our acquisition pipeline is rebuilding and our near-term focus is on smaller, bolt-on targets. Regarding the fourth quarter, we expect solid organic growth in Energy driven by North American well activity, especially in Texas and the Rockies and improved conditions in compression, continued organic growth in Engineered Systems driven by strong dynamics in our Industrial platform and global growth in our Printing and Identification, strong results in our Fluids markets primarily driven by regulatory tailwinds in Fluid Transfer, a positive retail fueling environment and continuing solid global markets for our pump businesses and a slightly stronger seasonal pattern in Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, reflecting shipments of a very strong Q3 ending backlog. With that, let me turn it over to Brad. Brad M. Cerepak: Thanks Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today we reported third quarter revenue of $2.1 billion, an increase of 8%. Organic revenue grew 4% and growth from acquisitions was also 4%. Adjusted EPS was $1.35, an increase of 8%. Segment margin for the quarter was 18.5%, 110 basis points below last year. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions, our overall margin was 19%. This acquisition impact was most prevalent in our Energy and Fluid segments.  Bookings increased 10% over the prior year to $2 billion. This result represents growth across all segments led by 14% growth in Fluids and 11% growth in Engineered Systems. Energy grew 9% while Refrigeration & Food Equipment posted bookings growth of 6%. Overall, book-to-bill finished at a seasonally normal 0.96. Our backlog increased significantly in the quarter, up 14% to $1.4 billion. Free cash flow was $259 million for the quarter or 12% of revenue. For the full year, we expect free cash flow to be approximately 11% of revenue. Now turning to Slide 4. All segments showed organic growth in the quarter. Fluids grew 6% benefiting from solid Fluid Transfer and Pump markets. Energy driven by strong core U.S. drilling and production markets grew 5%. Engineered Systems grew 4% with broad-based growth across both platforms. Refrigeration & Food Equipment was up 1%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 4% comprised of 11% Fluids, 4% in Engineered Systems and 3% in Energy. Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results. Revenue increased 2% from the second quarter. Results were led by 5% growth in Energy and 4% in Fluids. Refrigeration & Food Equipment grew 1% sequentially, while Engineered Systems was essentially flat.  Sequential bookings decreased 4%, representing normal seasonality. Energy driven by phase 2 of Queensland Gas Project grew 10%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 15% as shipments in Refrigeration normally slowed down in Q4. Fluids was down 6% as several large projects were booked in the previous quarter. Engineered Systems declined 4% on normal seasonality. Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $507 million increased 8% and earnings of $123 million were up 3% over last year. Energy produced a solid quarter with strong revenue growth in our Drilling & Production and compression markets. This strong performance more than offset continued softness in our bearings end markets and construction related winch markets. Within Drilling & Production growth was driven by strong U.S. well activity. The continued impressive performance of our drilling businesses and our sharply growing U.S. artificial lift business more than offset expected tough comps in Australia and a decline in Canada. The improved compression markets also helped drive solid growth. Overall, this segment continues perform at a high level and the addition of Accelerated will only serve to broaden our market opportunities in key North American basins. Operating margin was 24.2% and included 100 basis point impact related to recent acquisitions, primarily those completed in Q2 and Q3. Bookings were $526 million, a 9% increase over the prior year reflecting broad-based growth across the segment. Book-to-bill was 1.04. Adjusting for Queensland gas, book-to-bill was at 1.0, up 3% over an adjusted prior year. Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems had another solid quarter were revenue of $695 million was up 8% and earnings of a $119 million increased 7%. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue increased 13% to $291 million, driven by organic growth of 4% and recent acquisitions, primarily MS Printing. Of note, U.S. results for Markem-Imaje were extremely strong, up double-digits. In the industrial platform, revenue grew 5% to $405 million, all of which was organic. Our auto related businesses were particularly strong in this platform. Margin was solid at 17.2% as the benefits of productivity mostly offset the effective business mix. Bookings were $667 million, an increase of 11%, our Printing & Identification bookings increased 10% to $281 million boosted by recent acquisition and continued solid activity in our core fast moving consumer goods markets, especially in the U.S. Industrial bookings increased 12% to $386 million reflecting broad-based growth. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.97, while industrial was 0.95. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.96. Now, moving to Slide 8. Fluids posted a strong quarter were revenue increased 17% to $362 million and earnings of $68 million were up 7%. Revenue was driven by organic growth of 6% and acquisition growth of 11%. Our Fluid Transfer businesses benefited from strong demand in the global retail fueling markets, increasing safety regulations in Fluid Transfer and share gains. Pumps was driven by strong North American growth and new product introductions. Segment margin was 18.7%, a decrease of 170 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions. Bookings were $351 million, an increase of 14% driven by Fluid Transfer; book-to-bill was 0.97. Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment generated revenue of $529 million, up 1% over the prior year. Earnings of $78 million decreased 10%. Solid growth in refrigeration was partially offset by declines in food equipment; particularly at Belvac where project shipments can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Refrigeration growth of 3% was dampened by push outs from a major customer. Overall, refrigeration is well-positioned to finish the year strong. backlog is up $52 million, or 16% over the prior year, and September was the largest revenue month ever for Hill Phoenix. Operating margin was 14.8%, a 180 basis point decline from last year. this result largely reflects unanticipated supply chain costs, inefficiencies connected with customer push outs and customer mix. Bookings were solid at $459 million, an increase of 6% principally reflecting solid demand for refrigeration products. Book-to-bill was at a seasonally strong 0.87. Going to the overview on the Slide 10. third quarter net interest expense was $31 million, up $1 million from last year and in line with our forecasts. Corporate expense was $28 million, a decrease of $5 million and generally consistent with expectations. Our third quarter tax rate was 30.8%, excluding $0.03 of discrete benefits. Capital expenditures were $35 million in the quarter. we expect Q4 to be higher as we continue to execute on several projects. Lastly, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $100 million since the end of the second quarter. 856,000 of these were settled in Q3. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 5.1 million shares for $418 million. Moving to Slide 11, which shows our full-year guidance. We expect organic revenue growth to be approximately 4%. our forecast for energy is 4% to 5% growth; likewise, we also expect Engineered Systems revenue to grow 4% to 5%. Fluids organic revenue growth is forecast at 5% to 6%, while refrigeration and food equipment is expected to have approximately 1% organic growth. Completed acquisitions will now add 4%, up one point from our prior expectations, reflecting recent acquisitions, including Accelerated. In total, we expect full-year revenue growth to be approximately 8%. Segment margin is expected to be between 17.5% and 18%, including roughly a 70 basis point impact from completed acquisitions. Corporate expense will now be approximately $120 million, $5 million below our prior forecast representing cost management activities. Interest expense should be about $130 million, $3 million below our prior expectations. Our full year tax rate is estimated to be near 31%. CapEx should be about 2.3% of revenue, slightly below our prior forecast, and free cash flow is expected to be approximately 11% of revenue. Turning to the bridge on Slide 12. We now see volume, price, and mix contributing $0.26 to $0.29. Productivity will have $0.16 to $0.18, while investment and compensation will have $0.16 to $0.18 impact. Acquisitions in aggregate will now be essentially neutral for the year. This includes the current year dilutive impact of deals already closed in the third and fourth quarters. Corporate provides a $0.04 benefit at the high-end of our prior forecast, while interest shares and taxes contribute $0.13 to $0.14, $0.04 above our prior expectations. In total, we now expect 2014 EPS to be $4.75 to $4.80, reflecting a $0.05 reduction to the high-end of our prior guidance largely driven by the impact of recent acquisitions. This represents 10% growth at the mid-point. With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Bob for some final thoughts. Robert A. Livingston: Thanks Brad. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with our performance especially our strong September. We delivered solid revenue and earnings growth and also saw strong quarter activity. Looking forward, I believe we\u2019re well positioned for continued success based on our products, technologies, and competitive positions. Within energy, we expect our U.S. activity to remain solid given the basins we participate in and expect our global growth initiatives to continue to yield opportunities. We are enthusiastic about our recent accelerated deal. The technology accelerated brings to our portfolio, combined with our existing rod lift products allows us to offer customers artificial lift solutions earlier and for the complete life of their wells. All of these factors positioned us very well with our customers. In Engineered Systems, growing global applications for our Printing & Identification technology including the emerging digital textile market and the increasing awareness around food safety provides ample opportunities for expansion. Within our industrial markets, our customers\u2019 desire for productivity solutions along with a strong market or our auto-related businesses offer significant growth prospects. Within Fluids, increasing regulations regarding vapor recovery and the safe transport of chemicals and fuels provides a strong business climate for our Fluid Transfer businesses. Additionally, our Pumps business is benefiting from generally solid markets, particularly in North America and the Middle East, as well as the introduction of new products. And finally, in Refrigeration & Food Equipment we continue to focus on the ongoing needs of our customers for productivity and sustainable solutions. In addition, the regulatory environment is providing tailwinds with regard to energy efficiency standards, which plays to the strength of our product portfolio. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results.  With that, Paul, let\u2019s take some questions. Paul E. Goldberg: Thanks Bob. At this point, I\u2019d just like to remind everyone if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, we would greatly appreciate it. And with that, Paula, if we can have the first question. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners :  Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Robert A. Livingston: Hi, Jeff. Good morning. Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Hi. How are you doing? Robert A. Livingston: Great. Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Just on Energy, Bob. There is a little bit of commentary in the queue about margin pressure around cost. It was not clear to me if that was really just kind of some cost plus inflation or there\u2019s a negative comment embedded around price as part of that? Could you just kind of give us a little color on what\u2019s going on with price and cost in Energy? Robert A. Livingston:  Yes. I would say it\u2019s a little of both, Jeff, and within Energy, it would be specific to Artificial Lift. Our steel costs were up. I think the incremental cost in the third quarter versus a year ago, steel costs were up about $5 million. That\u2019s it, but it was still up. With respect to pricing, I think we\u2019ve commented on this a couple of times this year. The Canadian market has been soft and we have seen price pressure especially on rods. In fact, I would probably say exclusive to rods, both in Canada and maybe a little bit even in the Bakken basin, but it is restricted to that. Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners :  And then, just thinking about the pre-announcement, Bob. You guided an $0.08 miss, right. That\u2019s very precise, it wasn\u2019t $0.05 to $0.10, it was \u2013 that was $0.08. What really happened at the end of the quarter? And maybe a little color at how September ended and what you\u2019re seeing here on the early part of October, if you have any other color? Robert A. Livingston: Okay. So Brad, the $0.08 miss I think was split between I would call it three buckets. We anticipated a $0.03 miss in refrigeration. We were anticipating a $0.03 short fall in energy, and the balance of the $0.02 was really around increased deal cost in the third quarter that had not been anticipated as we open the quarter. Jeff, we had the $0.02 deal cost for sure and the $0.03 anticipated miss at refrigeration, my friend, we delivered that miss. The $0.03 anticipated miss on energy. I will stand up and give kudos to all of the units in the leadership teams within energy that gap was closed and I did it remarkably so in the final three weeks of the quarter. And I think based upon what we were looking at in mid-month. I think energy performed a bit better like $0.02 in September than we had anticipated. Any other color left Brad? Brad M. Cerepak: I guess the other $0.01 which is missing in that reconciliation is a little bit better corporate based on our cost controls Jeff. Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : And then just a quick one and I will move on. Brad, can you give us the organic bookings in general and energy specifically? Brad M. Cerepak: Oh, boy, I don\u2019t think I had that data in hand right now. I will ask Paul to follow-up with you on that. Paul E. Goldberg: Yes, give it to the entire group Jeffrey T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : All right, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Winoker of Bernstein Research. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Thanks and good morning all. Robert A. Livingston: Good morning. Brad M. Cerepak: Good morning. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: I would be help to continue get a little more color on the energy business but just in light of the overall macro concerns that are out there and your particular exposure at the basin level, what you\u2019re hearing from customers, I mean are typically allow these customers or folks who spend what they make. And just how you\u2019re looking at that business over the short to medium-term? Robert A. Livingston: Well, my comments Steve would be restricted to what we\u2019re seeing right now and our anticipation for the fourth quarter. There is enough noise that I am certainly right now and that I think I would reserve any comments to the beginning of the year of 2015 to perhaps our Dover Day Conference. If you want to know where are the \u2013 where our primary activity is in the basins, Permian by far is the largest basin for us, the second largest basin would be Eagle Ford, and the third would be the Bakken. And I would say that in a relationship comparison, Permian may be five times the activity versus what we see in the Bakken. With respect to what we\u2019re hearing for customers, the guys are talking to them weekly, the last \u2013 over the last couple of weeks, I would tell you they\u2019re talking to them almost every day. Their customers are really engaged in looking at their capital budgeting and planning for 2015, we\u2019re not hearing any input from them right now, other than they are looking at it. With respect to the fourth quarter here in 2014, we have been watching our order rates everyday for the past, I would say, three weeks, if not four weeks. If we were to see a bit of a pullback, or an early sign, it would be in our drilling businesses. we haven\u2019t seen it all. In fact the order rates, the average daily order rates in the first couple of weeks in October were at or absolutely above the third quarter average daily rate. We see no cancellations, no deferrals and we feel pretty confident sitting here today about our expectations for the fourth quarter in energy. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: And in that team, the energy team that was able to close the gap in the last few weeks that you commended. Was that gap closing just on it, was it on operating expense, I mean, how do they actually do it? Robert A. Livingston: No, I would say it was primarily driven by revenue and volume, and it was one business that was across the board. We had a little bit better volume as order rates picked up in the last couple of weeks of the month. We had a little bit better volume in our drilling business, and we continued to see strong activity in the U.S. market for artificial lift. artificial lift in the U.S. finished stronger in September than we had anticipated even at the middle of the month. Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.: Okay. thanks, I\u2019ll pass it on. appreciate it. Robert A. Livingston: Thanks. Brad M. Cerepak: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. good morning, guys. Robert A. Livingston: Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: : Robert A. Livingston: There are two different responses. In refrigeration, Nigel, to be quite direct about it, the problem in refrigeration, number one, I will tell you the number was about $8 million in refrigeration and I would label it primarily \u2013 well, I\u2019ll take the blame for this, it was primarily self-inflicted, it was around some unanticipated hiccups and cost we have with some supply chain changes we were making as we exited the second quarter. Within energy, there was as we were looking at booking rates and especially in August, there was a growing concern that that month of September would not have the growth and the U.S. artificial lift activity that we ended up same. Let me tell you what the growth was for the third quarter. I mean, we had a fairly healthy expectation for artificial lift in the third quarter, but I think artificial lift in the third quarter year-over-year I think we were up 16%. We came into September and felt that that growth rate was probably going to fall a couple of points shy of that, as it turns out, the gap was closed pretty quickly. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Well, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then the pace of buybacks has picked up in the early 4Q and I am just wondering Bob and Brad how you know the kind of the dynamic and math between buybacks that $72 as opposed to $90 compared to M&A right now? Robert A. Livingston: Okay, well, I would rather buyback at $72 than $93. I\u2019m not sure that \u2013 okay, Nigel we completed the $1 billion share buyback program as we exited and completed the first quarter. I think in the second quarter and the third quarter, it was a total of about $100 million of share repurchase activity with a bulk of that in the quarter three. We had as we sat and discussed, looked at share repurchase activity in July for the second half of the year. We knew we had some M&A activity that we were very hopeful on closing on in the second half and we did. I would also tell you we walked away from a couple of deals here recently were the pricing sort of gap beyond our comfort range. I sit here today at $72. It sure deserves another topic, round of discussion with Brad and myself. I would also tell you that the balance of the fourth quarter and I would even say our visibility into the first quarter of 2015 \u2013 M&A activity is going to be very, very light. If we do anything there\u2019s going to be rather small deals. And the cash flow that we\u2019ll generate here in the fourth quarter coupled with our existing share price, this is going to get some serious discussion with Brad and myself over the next couple of weeks. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Okay. So it sounds like you\u2019ve pretty much done on the M&A for the rest this year? Robert A. Livingston: I would say if we do anything it will be too small to even announce. Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC:  Okay. Well, thanks, Bob. Robert A. Livingston: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from John Inch at Deutsche Bank. John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Good morning, everyone. Robert A. Livingston: Hi, John. Brad M. Cerepak: Good morning, John. John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Bob, you\u2019ve been through these energy downturns or swings before and I think your performances really, I mean, it really stands out. What I\u2019m trying to understand is sort of connecting the dots between low price of oil, well appears to be pretty meaningful rising competition in North America, perhaps for some of your own businesses. What\u2019s the playbook here in terms of the steps you would take in anticipating and then reacting to perhaps a meaningful scale back from your customers who, I understand are already sort of planning CapEx for next year now. So they\u2019re sort of doing that against the backdrop of pretty low oil prices. And just any color you could have based on your experience would be helpful and how you\u2019re thinking about those. Robert A. Livingston: Well, we\u2019ll refer back. As you mentioned, we\u2019ve been through this before. It seems like a long time ago, but it was in the first half of 2009 and the business leaders, the segment leadership team has the ability to take cost out just about as quickly as we did in the first part of 2009, especially in our Artificial Lift business as well as in our drilling businesses. I would enable it, from a cost takeout point, we an attractive relationship between variable cost and fixed cost and we can pull the trigger pretty quickly in that area. John, for you and for the others, let me sort of put this in perspective for you. So the Energy segment, rough number. It\u2019s a $2 billion revenue segment. We\u2019ve got about $500 million in revenue and what I would label as our bearings and compression part of the business, not directly connected to rig count, or the drilling activity per se. Within drilling, or which is, and we\u2019ve recognized this. Our drilling activity is highly correlated to rig count. I would say, it\u2019s $450 million to $500 million in revenue. And then that would leave our artificial lift business activity, which is roughly $1 billion. And of that $1 billion, about 20% of it is non-North American activity, but 20% of it is \u2013 we will label it as automation. And it has much less to do with drilling activity and much more around offering productivity solutions and tool sets for our customers to optimize the cash flow and the profitability of individual wells and fields. So that needs about 60%, or about $600 million, of this $1 billion artificial lift business, around what I\u2019d call pure artificial lift tools equipment. In that 60%, rough number, rough split about 50% of it is after-market. More so on pumps than it is on rides, but about a 50% split to after-market and about 50% to new installations. So if we were to continue to see a precipitous decline in the price of oil, I think what we\u2019re going to see it first, we\u2019re going to be watching rig counts. And we see a decline in rig counts. We\u2019re going to see it very quickly in our drilling business. And I\u2019m talking global numbers here. We\u2019re going to watch it pretty closely. We have not seen that yet, John. With respect to new installation and artificial lift, yes, a decrease in deployed rig counts will eventually show up in artificial lift numbers. We are still depending and we\u2019ve seen this in the past, in 2009 that, that decline would start to be measured and felt, five, six, eight months after you see the beginning decline in rig counts. And I hope that gives you a little bit of detail and how we\u2019re looking at it. John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.:  That\u2019s actually really helpful, and Bob, you mentioned that 20% automation, maybe given the constructive declining oil price is clearly one of the ways you keep these wells flowing is to make them more productive. Does this perhaps advance your own... Robert A. Livingston: Yes, John that has been the clear strategic decision we\u2019ve made over the last five years, since the last downturn is to recognize that the automation capability that we could offer and we have grown that offering both organically as well as M&A over the last three or four years that that automation as well as our decision to expand and grow outside of North America, we think mitigates against the short decline that we saw in 2009 in this segment. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Yes, now I just wondering if maybe you could even make a bigger splash through software control automation M&A other than in the U.S., Canada or overseas and just in responding to the environment perhaps? Robert A. Livingston:  Okay, and I would tell you that there is nothing upsize that we have in our near-term pipeline, but the two or three that we have some interest in that we would look at and hope to close maybe in the next few months or in that area, John. John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank :  Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital :  Hi, good morning guys. Robert A. Livingston:  Hi, Scott. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : This accelerated deal, I mean, it\u2019s just a great asset people would know in the industry speak very highly of it. But is there any risk that you guys top tick this thing I mean that if indeed we do see a major breakdown in oil prices and artificial lift comes out of favor for a bit. Is there any sort of MAC clause in this that would allow you guys to adjust price down or at least protect yourselves if things do get ugly out there? Robert A. Livingston:  Even if things get ugly I don\u2019t think it would qualify as a MAC clause, Scott. But the real answer is we now own it and there is no price adjustment. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay, okay fair enough. And then I was a little bit surprised\u2026 Brad M. Cerepak: And by the way Scott, I was actually happy and pleased with the price we were able to deliver to Dover and to our shareholders\u2026 Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : No, it\u2019s not expensive. I\u2019m just \u2013 it\u2019s expensive if EBITDA gets cut in half, but it\u2019s not expensive on current numbers. So my follow on is that it\u2019s a little bit surprised to hear you say Bob that you\u2019re more focused on smaller deals. And I only really raise that just because when you do see I think many companies like yours have been waiting for a pullback like this to shake assets free and get sellers of the sidelines and such. I mean is in this the exact type of opportunity where companies like Dover really can step in and provide liquidity into a market that starts to need it? Robert A. Livingston: No, you\u2019re exactly right, but don\u2019t overlook the comment I shared earlier, I said near-term. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. Robert A. Livingston: when you look at what\u2019s in our pipeline that we could conceivably close on here in the fourth quarter, or in the first quarter of next year on labeling those deals that we have touched points on today is being small bolt-ons. The comment you make Scott is very, very appropriate and it\u2019s something that we talk about a lot even here in, especially here in the last two or three weeks is we see a correction like this that we believe this does give us an opportunity, but Scott for privately-owned businesses, I would tell you that there probably is at least a six-month lag on valuation set points and expectations of privately-owned businesses relative to a turning point in the public market. Brad M. Cerepak: I think that it gets back to the Bob\u2019s point that we walked away from; in the third quarter, two what I would characterize is mid-sized deals. Robert A. Livingston: Similar to the size of accelerated do specifically to valuations. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Right. and were those assets of Bob or somebody else or were they \u2013 they tabled? Robert A. Livingston: No, I think one specifically that was the size of, or if not a bit larger than accelerated. we believe that there was an agreement signed, but we don\u2019t know. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. Robert A. Livingston: We don\u2019t have any other detail. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Yes. I would just imagine there is\u2026 Robert A. Livingston: It truly hasn\u2019t closed yet. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Yes. as we said, there might be some private buyers, they thought that they could get financing three weeks ago may have a little bit of a tougher time now, so\u2026 Robert A. Livingston: Yes. Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital : Okay. Well that\u2019s great color. thanks, guys. good luck. Robert A. Livingston: Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Hi, thanks. Robert A. Livingston: Hi, Julian. Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Hi. Robert A. Livingston: Good morning Julian. Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  Good morning. Just on the fluids business within pumps, we had just under 3% organic sales growth, and one or two other companies have been out there. even today, talking about weak pump bookings, so just wondered how you\u2019re seeing that market right now? Robert A. Livingston: Okay. it\u2019s interesting, first off, I would \u2013 with specific response to your question on bookings, we have not seen a slowdown in order rates, and what I would label the core business, which we look at every \u2013 sort of look at weekly and track it pretty tightly. For us, the noise and I\u2019d call it in our up and down activity around order rates, as well as revenue has been more around the project business that we have seen here with the mag acquisition we made a couple of years ago and the Fender acquisition that we closed on about this time last year. but if you look at our core business, what I\u2019d call the core pumps, the Pump Solutions Group business, it\u2019s actually been pretty steady, and even if you back out fender and mag for this year, the growth has been much more consistent than we would have shown on the top line for our Pumps Solutions Group business in total. The North America business has continued to be quite solid, in fact our \u2013 I think our sales through distributors and North America has been up double digits this year. we have seen that continuing in the second half. We think we\u2019re in a very good product and competitive position here. Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC :  Thanks. and then within refrigeration & food equipment, you\u2019re going to split out the three different factors behind the 180 basis point margin decline in Q3. how do you see those three factors kind of changing into Q4, and how quickly should we think that margin can come back? Robert A. Livingston:  Well, if I had the same revenue level in Q4 as we had in Q3, you\u2019d see the margin come back. the biggest, I would call it almost an embarrassment that we dealt with in refrigeration in the third quarter were the issues around supply chain and logistics, and as I commented earlier actually, I sort of do a mea culpa here and that was sort of self-inflected, I would also tell you that issue was behind us, it was, as we went through the month of September, we feel like that problem was corrected. and by the way, it was corrected well enough that we had a record revenue month at Hill Phoenix in the month of September. A part of the issue, as I commented earlier was some push outs, I would just call it noise around scheduling that was itself inflected that we were having to deal with and that created quite a bit of labor inefficiency and scheduling inefficiencies in July and August particularly July and August. We\u2019ve got a very strong, I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a record backlog or not, it very well may be, but we\u2019ve had a very strong backlog at Hill Phoenix as we exit quarter three and the bulk of \u2013 a significant amount of our activity for Hill Phoenix for the fourth quarter is actually being delivered and earned in October. And as we sit here a little past mid month, the push outs from October to the early part of November have been minimal. Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Good, great. Robert A. Livingston: Let me just add a thought here as you\u2019re asking about margins and bringing into Q4. One thing I do want to point out as we mentioned before is that our energy, I know we\u2019re talking refrigeration right now, but our energy margins in Q4 will be impacted quite significantly by the accelerated deal. And so while you see very solid margins in Q3 that core margin expectation remains, what we will see as an impact of almost let\u2019s say 450 basis points to 500 basis points impact to energy in the fourth quarter due to purchase accounting and the rollover in essence of the inventory through the P&L. Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusav of J.P. Morgan Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Hey good morning. Robert A. Livingston: Hi, Steve. Brad M. Cerepak: Good morning. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Can you maybe just talk about the price cost dynamics that you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years in energy, I mean, what\u2019s kind of the annual pricing that you\u2019re getting in that business or that you\u2019ve gotten historically in that business in the last several years? Robert A. Livingston: Brad, help me on this one\u2026 Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: I mean the material or is it \u2013 I mean is it\u2026 Robert A. Livingston: I would say it was more material in 2010 and in 2011 Steve than it was in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Now, we\u2019ve had a little bit. We see this not just an energy we see this across the board and over. We do always look for opportunities to be a little bit more smart or strategic in our pricing. I would say that the pricing contribution for Dover in total has been close to but perhaps a bit less in 2014 than it was in 2012 and 2013, but it has still been positive. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: So kind of like below like \u2013 around flat but up a little bit 10, 20 bps something like that? Brad M. Cerepak: I would say 20 bps\u2026 Robert A. Livingston: I would use 10 bps to 20 bps, but you started off by asking about energy and I\u2019m going to repeat myself if you don\u2019t mind. We have been dealing with this now for almost a year. It has been something I think I\u2019ve pointed out in the April call. I know I did in the July call and I did again today that in Canada and to a lesser degree in the Bakken basin, we have dealt with price pressure, especially around rods. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: And what kind is that double-digit or is it not much that? Robert A. Livingston: No. I would say low-to-mid single digit. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay. And then just on refrigeration, the fourth quarter is pretty self-explanatory I guess Wal-Mart was out at their Investor Day talking about shifting their priorities to spend more on e-commerce and kind of limit the spending on their stores. I mean is there \u2013 how does the business look beyond kind of this catch up in the fourth quarter? How are you guys feeling about just the trends in refrigeration spend into 2015? Robert A. Livingston: We saw the announcement, in fact I would tell you that it was news to us. We\u2019ve seen that in some of the discussions we\u2019ve had with Wal-Mart in the last 30 to 60 days. I think their comments that they shared, Steve, with respect to store activity, number one, was new store construction, and number two, it was new store construction in the U.S.  We fully expect Wal-Mart to continue with a pretty healthy remodel program in 2015 and based upon everything we are seeing and hearing, seeing we\u2019ve actually got some orders on the books and we\u2019ve been told there are more coming that their new store construction and remodel activity outside of the U.S. continues to be pretty healthy next year. Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Robert A. Livingston: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, yes, good morning. Robert A. Livingston: Good morning, Andrew. Brad M. Cerepak: Good morning. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just couple of questions. Can you clarify the weakness in bearings, because given your comments on the strength of the Energy cycle so far, it\u2019s just a little bit surprising to reconcile it? Robert A. Livingston: Yes. It\u2019s all around compression activity. And I would \u2013 I have to start with a little bit of a revisit perhaps even into the some data we shared and some announcements we saw from some of our customers, as well as some CapEx announcements that were made earlier in the year by some of the larger E&P operators that with and I guess we started to see this late in the first quarter and going into the second quarter, where there was much more of a focus by the big guys in the oil patch to improve their cash flow. And there was some deferment and perhaps even some cancellation of projects. Not that we saw the cancellation. We actually saw some customer cancelling projects in areas outside of North America. And for us, it\u2019s around \u2013 that bearing activity is around the gas turbine for pipeline and transmission activity. We do believe that we\u2019ve passed the bottom on that. We\u2019ll see how this one unfolds over the next quarter or two. But we saw in all three, maybe even four of the OEMs that we support with our bearing business, especially GE and Siemens. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And can you also comment on Printing & ID, because one of your competitors has also made positive comments about it. I\u2019m just surprised by the organic growth given all the headlines. Robert A. Livingston:  Organic growth where? Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Printing & ID, Markem-Imaje, specifically North America. Particularly you\u2019ve highlighted consumer strength in the U.S. Could you just comment where that is coming from? Robert A. Livingston:  Well, you\u2019re right. We did have pretty strong growth in the U.S. in the third quarter, but I would also point out that it probably stood alone in the third quarter with respect to regional growth rates at MI. But the growth \u2013 we\u2019ve actually been experiencing good growth in the U.S. market for \u2013 gosh, Brad, 18 months now? Brad M. Cerepak: Yes. Robert A. Livingston: At least 18 months. We commented on that here in our script because it sort of stood alone. Europe was fairly solid, but not like we saw here in the U.S. China, I sort of labeled as okay, but again, not like we saw here in the U.S. It was fairly broad-based in the U.S., both consumables as well as equipment. And I would also say we were pleased with capturing a couple of new customers in the third quarter. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Would you attribute most of the strong performance to Dover specific events or do you think it\u2019s just broader markets? They\u2019re just chugging along quite nicely? Robert A. Livingston: Well, I think the market is performing quite nicely. But I\u2019d like to think we over performed the market. Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Nathan Hardie Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company:  Good morning, Bob, Brad, Paul Robert A. Livingston: Good morning. Paul E. Goldberg: Good morning. Nathan Hardie Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company: Just want to follow up on a couple things Julian was asking about earlier on. You talked about within the pump business some noise, I think, you called it, on project activity at Mag and Fender. Can you may be give some more color on that, what you\u2019re seeing out there in the market at the moment and what demand trends look like for you? Robert A. Livingston: Okay well, I think, two different businesses in two different applications and I call it verticals. Mag is mostly, most of their play is in the chemical and plastics vertical and Fender is mostly in the oil and gas vertical, and even there, I would tell you that most of \u2013 almost all of the Fender\u2019s activity is outside of the U.S. market. That still remains an opportunity for us. I don\u2019t have the detail by quarter on how each of those two businesses have shown on their booking trajectory. Just because of the nature of the business and it\u2019s probably little bit more lumpy at Fender than it is at Maag. But nature of their business does include a fair amount of project activity and a project award. And second quarter may result in organic bookings growth, or bookings growth of 20% over booked over the previous year. And the lack of that project award in the third quarter may result in negative bookings growth when you compare it year-over-year. When you look at it over longer periods of time, the growth at Fender, my goodness, has been \u2013 is the business up 50% since we acquired the business two years ago. I mean that may be the magnitude of the growth we\u2019ve seen at Maag. What I call the two and half years that we\u2019ve owned the business. And Fender, we\u2019ve owned for a little less than a year and this year has been a year of consolidation and on-boarding of Fender. I think you\u2019ll some growth in Fender next year. Nathan Hardie Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company: But in term of\u2026 Robert A. Livingston: It is a ramped project activity. Nathan Hardie Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company: Yes, in terms of maybe RFPs or something like that, you haven\u2019t seen any meaningful change in activity. Robert A. Livingston: Well I\u2019m not sure I can even answer that with respect to Fender, it is one of the smaller businesses within PSG. And quite frankly I probably don\u2019t pay as much attention to those order rates as I should. I do pay much more attention to Maag just because of its size. And the RFP activity, like I was just speaking last week to the gentleman who runs the business and that customer activity, the RFP activity, is quite strong. Nathan Hardie Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company: Great. Thanks. And you also mentioned that Brazil was pretty weak in the quarter, any color you can give on that? Robert A. Livingston: Yeah, Brazil was ugly. Nathan Hardie Jones \u2013 Stifel, Nicolaus & Company: Any outlook for when that might change? Robert A. Livingston: No, it\u2019s ugly and\u2026 Brad M. Cerepak: It\u2019s very smaller for us. Robert A. Livingston: It\u2019s small. Brad M. Cerepak: I am not even sure what our revenue base. Robert A. Livingston: It\u2019s less than $100 million for Dover, but I know sitting here today it\u2019s going to be difficult for us to anticipate or project any growth in Brazil for next year or at least I don\u2019t want to, but in the third quarter our decline in revenue in the third quarter I think was well over 14% in Brazil. Brad M. Cerepak: And again, I will use the word ugly and I think Paul is about right to chock me and tell me we are out of time. Paul E. Goldberg: All right. Thanks a lot for your time. Brad M. Cerepak: Thank you. Robert A. Livingston: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Paul E. Goldberg: Thank you, Paula. This concludes our conference call. We thank you as always for your continued interest in Dover and we look forward to speaking to you in January to go over the full year results. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s third quarter 2014 conference call.",

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. We finish the year with a very strong fourth quarter, achieving solid revenue growth and earnings growth that exceeded expectations. We saw robust topline growth at each segment, led by Energy and Fluids, results again overall growth of 11%, including organic growth of 6%. We also achieved solid volume leverage as three of our four segments improved margin excluding restructuring cost. From a geographic perspective, we saw solid growth in the U.S., Europe and Asia, whereas Latin America continued to be weak. Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, revenue growth was strong as U.S. drilling and production customer activity was as expected. Our recent acquisition accelerated, exceeded our expectations, and the automation and bearings and compression markets were solid. In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid growth across both platforms. Within Printing & Identification, our recent MS acquisition continued to perform well and more than offset European softness in our core printing and coating markets. The Industrial platform achieved strong broad-based growth led by outstanding results in our auto related and waste handling businesses. Our Fluid segment once again performed well. We are continuing robust market conditions for Fluid Transfer products and improved pump markets resulted in organic growth of 9%. Refrigeration and Food Equipment generated very strong revenue growth of 8%, were strong refrigeration performance was supported by shipments of quarter three push-outs. Since the end of the third quarter, we have taken actions to strengthen and position our company for 2015 with a focus on our portfolio and cost reduction. We made a decision to divest Datamax O'Neil and Sargent, which now have been reported as discontinued operations. While both are strong companies, these actions increased our focus on our core growth markets. Also as indicated at our Investor Day in early December, we took decisive actions to adjust our cost and streamline our businesses. We executed well on our restructuring initiatives and completed our planned actions in the fourth quarter. Specific to energy, though U.S. drilling and production revenue and customer activity has been as strong as expected, we have been proactively reducing cost in anticipation of lower customer activity in 2015. Our acquisition pipeline continues to rebuild though no significant deals are eminent. We repurchased 2.7 million shares in the fourth quarter and recently put a new standing authorization in place. Now let me provide our revenue outlook for 2015, which is unchanged from our Investor Day for Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration and Food Equipment, their markets have remained healthy and we expect them to have solid growth in 2015. As you would expect, the big change to our forecast is in Energy, where the rapid decline in oil prices is significantly impacting energy CapEx spending and U.S. rig counts. As a result, within Energy, we expect lower revenue in our U.S. based drilling and production businesses; however, we continue to expect our international oil and gas activity and our bearings and compression businesses to grow. In Engineered Systems, we anticipate continued growth driven by strong dynamics in our industrial platform and global growth in printing and identification. Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for our pumps and fluid transfer businesses, supported by increased safety and environmental regulations, a positive retail fueling environment and new product introductions. And lastly, Refrigeration and Food Equipment is expected to grow, driven by our focus on customer service and best-in-class products. We expect to grow our position with many customers in 2015, driven by innovative products like CO2 systems and heat exchangers to name just a few. With that let me turn it over to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks Bob. Good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 11%. Organic revenue grew 6% and growth from acquisitions was 7% offset by 2% of FX. Adjusted EPS was $1.01, excluding this free tax benefits. This result includes $0.17 of restructuring and other costs. Segment margin for the quarter was 14.8%, 210 basis points below last year. Adjusting for restructuring and normal acquisition purchase accounting cost, our overall margin was 17.3%. Bookings increased 4% over the prior year to $1.9 billion, led by Energy and Engineered Systems. Overall book-to-bill finished at 0.95. Our backlog was essentially flat at $1.2 billion. Free cash flow was $390 million for the quarter. For the full year, we generated free cash flow of $787 million, 10% of revenue or a 100% conversion of net income. Now turning to Slide 4. All segments grew organically in the quarter. Fluids grew 9% benefiting from solid fluid transfer and pump markets. Refrigeration and Food Equipment driven in part by shipments of Q3 push-outs grew 8%. Engineered Systems grew 5%, with strong growth in the industrial platform. Energy was up 1%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 7% comprised of 20% in Energy, whereas Engineered Systems grew 4% and Fluids increased 3%. Turning to Slide 5 in our sequential results. Revenue decreased 2% from the third quarter primarily reflecting normal seasonality. Overall Energy grew 8%, while Fluids increased 4%. Engineered Systems was down 3%, while Refrigeration and Food Equipment declined 13%. Sequential bookings decreased 3%, principally reflecting anticipated lower orders in refrigeration and the timing of orders in food equipment. In all, Engineered Systems grew 5% and Energy increased 2% on the strength of acquisitions. Fluids declined 2% and Refrigeration and Food Equipment declined 20%. Now on Slide 6. Energy revenue of $550 million increased 20% and earnings of $105 million decreased 6% from last year. Excluding the combined $90 million impact of Q4 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, earnings increased 11%. Overall as we expected Energy produced a very good quarter. Strong revenue growth in our drilling and production markets was largely driven by acquisitions, the completion of U.S. shale projects and solid Middle East activity. Our Bearings and Compression and automation markets remained modestly positive. We took restructuring actions in the fourth quarter as well as additional actions to align our cost to anticipated market conditions. We remain proactive and now expect to incur restructuring cost in Energy of $13 million to $15 million in the first quarter. When the first quarter actions are complete, we will have reduced our energy headcount by approximately 900 or 14% in total. Excluding the Q4 restructuring and purchase accounting costs, our adjusted operating margin was 22.5%, slightly exceeding our expectations. Bookings were $535 million, a 21% increase over the prior year largely reflecting acquisitions. Organic bookings grew 2%. Book-to-bill was 0.97. Turning to Slide 7. Engineered Systems had another solid quarter, where revenue of $592 million was up 6% and earnings of $93 million increased 7%. Excluding restructuring, earnings improved 11% to $97 million. Our Printing and Identification platform revenue increased 4% to $248 million, primarily driven by strong digital printing results. Organic revenue grew 1% where solid equipment sales were partially offset by a softer Europe. FX was a 6% headwind in this platform in the fourth quarter. In the Industrial platform, revenue grew 8% to $345 million all of which was organic. Revenue growth was broad based with particularly strong performance in our auto related and waste handling businesses. Adjusted margin was up 70 basis points to 16.4% on volume leverage excluding restructuring. Bookings were $623 million, an increase of 11%. Our Printing & Identification bookings increased 6% to $248 million driven by acquisitions earlier in the year and generally solid market conditions. Industrial bookings increased 15% to $374 million reflecting strong broad-based growth. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.00, while industrial was 1.09. Overall, book-to-bill was 1.05. Now on Slide 8. Fluids posted a strong quarter where revenue increased 10% to $377 million and earnings of $63 million were up 14%. Excluding restructuring, earnings improved 20% to $66 million. Revenue was driven by organic growth of 9% and acquisition growth of 3%. Our Fluid Transfer businesses benefited from strong demand in global retail fueling markets, increased safety environmental regulations and share gains. Pumps, was driven by healthy chemical markets and new product introductions. Excluding restructuring, adjusted margin was 17.4% an increase of a 140 basis points resulting from strong leverage on volume. Bookings were $346 million, a decrease of 2%, primarily reflecting the timing of project-related orders within pumps. Book-to-bill was 0.92. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment generated revenue of $459 million, up 8% over the prior year. Excluding restructuring of $25 million, earnings improved 19% to $56 million. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong refrigeration shipment supported by Q3 push-outs. Excluding restructuring, adjusted operating margin was 12.2%, a 130 basis point improvement from last year. This result largely reflects improved performance in volume leverage. Bookings were $368 million, a decrease of 18%, principally reflecting an anticipated reduction in orders in refrigeration and the timing of orders and food equipment. Book-to-bill was 0.80. Now going to the overview Slide number 10. Fourth quarter net interest expense was $31 million, up $1 million from last year and in-line with our forecast. Corporate expense was $30 consistent with expectations and included a $3.6 million pension settlement charge. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 27.3%, excluding $0.02 of discrete benefits. This rate was lower than in previous forecast and principally impacted by the R&D tax credit and tax benefits related to restructuring actions. Capital Expenditures were $57 million in the quarter. For the full year we invested $166 million or 2.1% of revenue. Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 2.7 million shares for $208 million. For the full year, we repurchased 7.5 million shares for $601 million. Now on Slide 11, which is an update on Energy? As Bob said, a lot has changed in Energy since our Investor Day. As a result, we expect our U.S. drilling and new well production businesses to be significantly impacted by lower commodity cost. We expect this impact to be less but still present in our businesses within U.S. recurring production and automation exposure. Finally, we expect our Bearings & Compression in international oil and gas activity to remain very solid. We now expect full year revenue for Energy to decline 6% to 9%, a reduction of about 15 points from our prior forecast, or about $300 million in revenue with organic revenue declining 11% to 14%, the biggest changes in our Drilling and Production markets, primarily driven by the anticipated reduction in U.S. shale activity. Our automation forecast has changed slightly where as Bearings & Compression remains unchanged from our prior forecast. Now moving to Slide 12 which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be positive 1% to negative 2% principally reflecting our current forecast for Energy, as our other three segments remain unchanged. Completed acquisition will now add 2% down one point from our prior expectations. We now expect the total impact of FX to be a 2% headwind, a point higher than our prior forecast. In summary, we expect total year-over-year revenue to be 1% positive to 2% negative. Segment margin is expected to be between 17.6% and 17.9% excluding restructuring charges. Corporate expense will be approximately $125 million and interest expense should around a $130 million. We expect the full year normalized tax rate to be approximately 30%. CapEx should be about 2.3% of revenue and our full year free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue. Now turning to the bridge on Slide 13. Note that in the appendix is information that provides the basis of our 2015 guide. In 2015 we expect net restructuring essentially the non-repeat of Q4 cost netted against Q1 expected cost and other one-time items to add $0.09 to $0.10. Performance which includes volume and price, productivity, compensation investment and restructuring benefits, will be in the range of a $0.10 benefit to a $0.06 decline, largely depending on volume. The impact of acquisitions already completed will be $0.01 to $0.03. Shares will provide $0.27 to $0.29 based on an estimate of $600 million in repurchases in 2015 and carry over benefit of our 2014 repurchases. Our share repurchases activity will more than offset at $0.18 dilutive impact of discontinued operations. Interest, corporate and tax rate will have a combined $0.07 to $0.11 impact. In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $4.70 to $4.95, reflecting a $0.35 reduction to our prior guidance. One last note, as we move sequentially into 2015 our first quarter EPS will be impacted by approximately $17 million to $20 million in Q1 restructuring charges, as well as remaining purchase accounting cost. Combined, these items will impact Q1 EPS by $0.13 to $0.14. With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts. Robert Livingston : Thanks Brad. Overall, I am pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance. We grew revenue 8% and delivered 10% EPS growth. We focused on lean and productivity initiatives across the organization and in the fourth quarter, restructured many of our businesses to be better positioned for continued growth and margin expansion. In 2015, we will continue to execute a strategy that has served us well. This includes investing in geographic expansion, product innovation and providing solutions that increase our customer\u2019s cash flow and reduce their cost through productivity. Across all four segments our business leaders are focused on executing these initiatives and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll deliver a solid 2015. We remain focused on growth. With that, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focused on serving our customers and driving results. Now Paul, let\u2019s take some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks Bob. At this point, I would like to remind all the callers that we have a lot of people in queue. So if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, we\u2019ll be able take a lot more questions. And with that Maria if we can have the first question. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning guys. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Robert Livingston : Good morning Scott. Scott Davis : Can you give us a sense of how much you\u2019ve stress tested this new forecast in drilling and production negative 17 and negative 19 core growth? And just give us a sense of how you came to that number, was that based on bookings or bottoms up from your customers? Just a little bit more granularity there will be helpful. Brad Cerepak : Okay, gosh Scott I can\u2019t tell you how many different models we\u2019ve run with respect to the drilling and production activity for 2015. So how was this number - how do we provide this number, what are the underlying assumptions and the work we\u2019ve done? Yes it does reflect a lot of conversations with our customers over the last few weeks. I would tell you that one of the data points that everyone does look at and continue to track is rig count deployment. And this range we provide for 2015 assumes a rig count decrease year-over-year average of 25% to 30%. Scott Davis : Okay. That seems fair. Brad Cerepak : I will also tell you that we will - we do expect to see a little bit of the anticipated decline show up in their first quarter, but Scott this is going to be a modest impact in their quarter. We do expect the second and third quarters to bear the brunt of this downturn. We do expect the rig count declined to be rather steep and reflective of what we\u2019re seeing here in the last few weeks. Scott Davis : Yes makes sense. And you gave a number of $300 million revenue hit, I mean, I know this is hard to do, but given all the restructuring and the cost out, do you plan to do - I mean, what kind of a drop through to profits, do you see that? Brad Cerepak : Well okay let\u2019s say - what are - repeat that question. Robert Livingston : So if you take that $300 million\u2026 Scott Davis : So if you take $300 million\u2026 Robert Livingston : What\u2019s the decremental margin? Scott Davis : Yes. Brad Cerepak : Well, I mean if I just look at, okay so the way we\u2019re thinking about that and the way we forecasted is that 300 net of. The benefits we see in 2015 of restructuring offset by some costs, as we talked about, would drop to at about 30%. Scott Davis : Okay. Brad Cerepak : So that\u2019s basically what we\u2019re assuming, Scott. ScottDavis: Okay, fair enough. And just last and I\u2019ll past it on. Can you just update us on close-the-case, it didn\u2019t seem all that encouraging the comments you made on Refrigeration and Food Equipment with the book-to-bill that. Is close-the-case something that still is a legitimate or is it getting pushed out? Robert Livingston : No, close-the-case is continuing to perform quite well. You\u2019re referring to the bookings number in the fourth quarter. ScottDavis: Yes, down 8%. Robert Livingston : Yeah. First of, I would tell you that I think Brad commented on this in his prepared remarks, part of that loop is the timing of orders in our Food Equipment platform. We\u2019ve got one business and the food equipment group that does have very choppy order rates. It\u2019s very much of a project business that\u2019s Belvac. And I think that almost half of that 20% or 18% year-over-year decline is just associated to the timing of orders at Belvac. And there is nothing wrong with the Belvac business. It will continue to perform quite well with just timing of orders. With respect to Hill Phoenix; Scott, I would tell you that we had another record year in revenue at Hill Phoenix. I think they had a 2% or 3% organic growth in 2014. We had a year where book-to-bill again was 1.0% for Hill Phoenix like it was in 2013, but you see between the two years, a very, very different waterfall of quarterly order rates at Hill Phoenix. And part of what you see in the fourth quarter is an anticipated product mix change. I call it a slight product mix change as we go into 2015. And we will expect in 2015 a little bit higher waiting in our business mix towards doors, doors with - our cases with doors and a little bit of a reduced waiting on systems. And part of that is showing up in the fourth quarter order rates. System orders tend to show up anywhere from one to three months before orders per cases do and where the fourth quarter order rates reflect that and it was anticipated. ScottDavis: Okay. That\u2019s for that granularity guys. Good presentation. Thank you and good luck. Robert Livingston : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. DeaneDray: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Robert Livingston : Hi, Deane. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Deane Dray : I don\u2019t want to sound like Monday morning quarter backing, but I recall in the December\u2026 Robert Livingston : Excuse me. Deane Dray : I know [Multiple Speakers]. But if we go back to the December outlook meeting when you announced the restructuring, I think most people, my self included, were surprised that you weren\u2019t doing more restructuring on the Energy piece, which everyone knew was in the middle of this downturn and actually early stages, most of the restructuring was in Refrigeration. So now, we\u2019re seeing restructuring actions. Are you behind the curve in this? And the decrementals of 30% kind of means would suggest that you\u2019re right on pace with where you should be. So maybe you just reconcile expectations on the pace of restructuring for starters. Robert Livingston : Okay, I would - everything being equal, maybe we could have done a little bit more in the fourth quarter. And yes, I would even label that as a little bit of Monday morning quarter backing with respect to my comment. Don\u2019t lose side effect that as went through the fourth quarter, Scott, we were - Deane, we were still in a growth mode within this Energy segment. And a lot of the costs we\u2019re taking out are variable cost related to being able to serve the customer with respect to shipments. It was a bit difficult to take more cost, especially variable cost out in the fourth quarter when we were still expanding our U.S. production rates here to satisfy customers. We are responding, I think, fairly aggressively here in the early part of the first quarter. I think between the actions that we took in the fourth quarter and the actions that we\u2019re pulling the trigger on here in the first quarter, those actions will generate annualized benefits for our Energy segment in the range of $55 million to $60 million, is that the right number, Brad? Brad Cerepak : That\u2019s right. Robert Livingston : And I think we\u2019ll end up picking up about $45 million to $50 million of that in 2015 or might a bit high on that. Brad Cerepak : That\u2019s what the forecast shows. Robert Livingston : And Deane all I can tell you is that we have - we continue to model and look at different scenarios as we have opportunities or as we think the market activity would dictate. We\u2019re going to take cost out, especially related to U.S. production and drilling activity. But I would also point out, these guys have - are also dealing with an initiative from need [ph] on growth. We are continuing to expand our activity outside of the U.S. We\u2019re continuing to spend a fair amount of money on product development and product innovation. And you\u2019ll see us continue to work the growth initiatives within automation and within Bearings & Compression. And I think those initiatives may even provide a little bit of upside to this segment in 2015. DeaneDray: So just as my follow-up let\u2019s just stay right there, but if we could, may be just expand on your expectations for the growth in the international oil and gas and in the compression business, this degree of confidence, earnings visibility, length of contracts and so forth? Robert Livingston : Well it\u2019s probably the one that\u2019s most fun to talk about, perhaps the easiest to talk about Deane, is the activity that we have been pushing, pursuing and growing over the last three years around our geographic expansion, especially around our artificial lift activity. We\u2019ve been fairly successful with that over the last three years or four years, we continue to see an increasing number of tenders that we can participate in with each quarter as we go through this activity outside of the U.S. Upside activity or upside opportunities in 2015, you know will tell you that we have nothing in our revenue plan for 2015 on non-U.S. tender activity other than what\u2019s in our backlog. And we do know that we\u2019ve got opportunities in front of us on tender orders that will be awarded here in the first quarter and the second quarter and in the Middle East, notably Oman. And some activity and I call it broader Asia and there we\u2019re looking at some interesting activity in India. But those tenders if we are successful and whatever impact they have on 2015 will be an upside for the segment. DeaneDray: Great, thank you. Robert Livingston : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Charlie Brady : Hi thanks good morning guys. Robert Livingston : Hi, Charlie. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Charlie Brady : Its just on the Refrigeration business, are you guys seeing - you\u2019ve seen targets kind of pulling out of Canada, obviously the Walmart kind of roll out issues still going on, any change kind of in the target Walmart, Dollar Store kind of segmented as far as what they are doing on cap spending and how that\u2019s impacting that segment? Robert Livingston : You\u2019re asking me to look back or look forward? Charlie Brady : Look forward. Robert Livingston : Look forward, fine. Well first of, I would tell you that, if we use 2015 as a - or 2014 as a reference point, our revenue activity with target my goodness in the second half of the year, Charlie, was probably less than $10 million. So even with the continued activity that\u2019s going on at Target to - for them to sort of reposition their business that\u2019s - even if it went to zero that\u2019s not going to have much of an impact on our business and in 2015. Year-over-year and 2014 Wal-Mart and Target together, we probably saw a decline of approaching $30 million year-over-year 2014 over 2013. We do include in our forecast for 2015 another year-over-year decline on the combination of Wal-Mart and Target. I actually don\u2019t remember the exact number, but I think it maybe even a little bit higher than the $30 million we had in 2014, but it\u2019s not three times that size, but I think we do expect a decline. Where we are seeing the growth in this business is all of the other customers outside of these two. I think we ended up with 5% or 6% or 7% growth and all of the other customers within this refrigeration business in 2014 and we\u2019re expecting something like that number again in 2015. Charlie Brady : Okay. So simply sounds like when the larger sized retailers, almost a non-event and being well more than offset by companies outside that - those guys. Robert Livingston : Correct. Charlie Brady : Okay. Just one more follow-up just on the Energy business, the outlook, the revised outlook from acquisition growth which I guess this is all accelerated. It looks as though you\u2019re forecasted that has accelerated down about 35% relative to what I guess their 2014 revenue is estimated to be on your bottom, is that about right? Robert Livingston : Okay, I'm not sure I can do the quick math on the percent. I think maybe when we provided our initial outlook at Dover Day in early December; Brad, you\u2019re going to have to help me here, but I think the revenue outlook for Accelerated may have been in the 240 to 250 range in my close. Brad Cerepak : Yes, that\u2019s correct. Robert Livingston : Okay. And for 2015 revised outlook, we\u2019ve got it slightly below 200. Correct me if I'm wrong. Brad Cerepak : It\u2019s a little bit lower than that, but that\u2019s directionally right. Robert Livingston : Okay. Brad Cerepak : And Charlie, I would tell you, I would love to sit here a year from now and tell you I was really conservative with that outlook. I will tell you that the Accelerated team outperformed in the fourth quarter. Goodness I think their revenue in the fourth quarter was about 15% higher than what we had modeled. I know, they are holding a quite well here in January, I was actually down to see the guys, I guess about a week ago or two weeks ago. And it just absolutely amazes me how many different opportunities they are finding to satisfy customers, to help customers with productivity and cash flow projects that we just don\u2019t account for when in forecast when we put together our acquisition model. It is possible but this is one of our business units in 2015 that even if we\u2019re right on nailing the rig count declined of 25% to 30% even with that, here is one business within our official book that get actually outperform our expectations. Charlie Brady : That\u2019s great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks to the color on that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thank you, good morning everyone. Robert Livingston : Hi, Joe. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Hi, so my first question, just going back to Energy for a minute. Clearly things have changed since early December when we met. But I\u2019m just wondering, did you guys see significant deceleration in your order trends in December and then to start January, because right now, it looks like we\u2019ve got orders are up 21%, but it was really based on the accelerated acquisition. So I\u2019m just trying to really get a sense for the trends in your organic orders for the Energy business. Robert Livingston : Hi, Brad may have details on some of the order trends, but are you asking - was the question sequentially from third quarter to fourth quarter? Brad Cerepak : And then into January, yes. Robert Livingston : Organically and the fourth quarter - I don\u2019t have the detail, I can\u2019t even remember what the difference was in order rates between October and December. So I\u2019m seeing here a little bit on comfortable trying to take a guess a direction. But there weren\u2019t any surprises Joe and the order rates in the fourth quarter. As we move from the fourth quarter, as we move from December into January, one of the things that sort of seems to incur every single year though it\u2019s always difficult to predict when we\u2019ll deal with it, is a little bit of restocking with some customers especially around our drilling customers, drill bit customers and sometimes with our sucker rod customers. It is not unusual for us to see that little bit of, I call it, two to three week of inventory management period occur in the fourth quarter. It didn\u2019t occur this year. What we did see was it occurring in the first two weeks of January. There was some choppiness in the order rates, both with our drill-bit customers in the first couple of weeks of January as well as with our sucker rod customers. We get beyond those first two weeks, what we call the restocking management activity and order rates have returned to the levels that we have expected here for the first quarter. Joe Ritchie : So it sounds like that changed your organic growth guidance for the drilling and production business is really driven by customer conversations on what you expect to come as opposed to what you\u2019re actually seeing in your business today, is that a fair comment? Robert Livingston : That\u2019s a fair comment that I would like to strongly support. It\u2019s the guide down from Dover Day on our Energy business is what we anticipate to see here in the second, third and fourth quarters that guide down is not reflective of the activity we\u2019re seeing here in the early part of the first quarter. Joe Ritchie : Okay, it\u2019s fair. And I guess the follow-on to that is really relating to the restructuring spend on the energy side of the business. It seems like you took that up by about $0.05 in the first quarter versus your initial expectations in the early part of December. I guess the question is how confident do you feel that you ring fence the issue or if you do start to see the order trends decline significantly as you anticipate as we progressed through the year. Can we presume that there is going to be more restructuring in Energy? I'm just trying to get my head around that. Robert Livingston : Okay, so, I actually think that business teams and business leaders have been quite responsive. I would even say contrary or even though I may say here Monday morning quarter back as in earlier call or used the phrase, the guys have actually been quite proactive in taking cost out ahead of cost from a reduction in their activity. Is there more we can do if customer activity slips even deeper or even further from what we\u2019ve planned? The answer is yes. And even we\u2019ve got a fairly aggressive cost plan take out for their first quarter, if by the time we get into the March and April timeframe, if we believe then that the customer activity either being driven by even lower rig count deployment in 2015 beyond the 25% to 30% decline or for whatever reason we are fully prepared to take additional cost out and the trigger points have been identified. BradCerepak: Yes, I guess so, we\u2019d only add to that reiterate what you said earlier Bob is that, while we\u2019re taking a lot of cost out and we\u2019re proactively I believe ahead of the curve of the downturn from rig counts and the commodity impact. One thing we\u2019re - here\u2019s what we\u2019re not doing, we\u2019re not backing off our investment or growth initiatives within Energy and I think Bob said that earlier, we continue to invest in innovation, in new product development, geo reach\u2026 RobertLivingston: Across the board. BradCerepak: Across the board. And so that that\u2019s what our forecast reflects. Joe Ritchie : Okay, thanks guys. I get back in queue. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan of UBS. ShannonO\u2019Callaghan: Good morning, guys. Robert Livingston : Well, Shannon, welcome back. ShannonO\u2019Callaghan: Thanks, Bob. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. ShannonO\u2019Callaghan: I appreciate it. I missed all the fun. So in terms of the drilling and production decline of 17% and 19%, can you give us a split of the drilling versus the production piece and also within production what pieces that you expect to kind of hold that better than others. Robert Livingston : Well, I left that book in my office, I wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with that kind of detail. ShannonO\u2019Callaghan: Take your shot. Robert Livingston : Okay, so I would tell you that you\u2019ll see a little bit of a steeper decline in revenue at our drilling business. And that shouldn\u2019t be a surprise to anyone it was not a surprise us, we sort of solved that in the last downturn in 0.08 and 0.09. And they solved the sharpest decline, but also the quickest recovery, once we hit the turf. To a lesser degree, we say it in U.S., we used a phrase production, but I\u2019m going to be more specific here in U.S. artificial lift applications, it will start later with artificial lift, then we\u2019ll see with drilling activity. And it will not be uniform across our artificial lift product portfolio. I think you will see - I think we anticipate more of a decline in our rod business than we do our pump business. Simple, because a much, much higher percentage of our pump activity is after market and repair and service as apposed to new well completion. But I this session will give you actual percentages Shannon, I\u2019d be guessing and then Paul would spend the rest of the day correcting my guesses. ShannonO\u2019Callaghan: No, no, the - I just the dynamics. Robert Livingston : Yeah. ShannonO\u2019Callaghan: That\u2019s helpful in terms of the different product lines. And then as you think about restructuring and sort of trying to defend margins in this downturn, you did it very successfully in the last downturn, is there anything different about the nature of the business now or nature of the downturn, or is it pretty much the same playbook, you feel like you have to execute? Robert Livingston : Well, I would say we start with the same playbook. The business is little bit larger today, than it was in 2008 and 2009. And we\u2019re a bit more geographic, we\u2019re bit more geographic, than we were in 2008 and 2009. That said, I would say that the playbook in our drilling business is essentially the same today, as it was in 2009. Where you\u2019ll see some differences will be in our artificial lift business and product portfolio, simply because, in 2008 the bulk of it was sucker rods and today it is probably 60% pumps and service activity and 40% sucker rods and I\u2019m probably still being heavy on the rod business. But the playbook is very much the same, the guys know how to execute this, we know how to take care of our customer as we go through this downturn, we know how to time to take out a variable cost and we know how to time to take out of overhead and when it\u2019s appropriate and we are trying to hold margins, that is one of the objectives. But don\u2019t get hung up on that, thinking that that\u2019s our primary objective, the primary objective it\u2019s actually to take care of the customers. And to continue with our product development and innovation activity, the result of all of this is we do believe we\u2019ll end up with margins within the Energy segment of about 20%. ShannonO\u2019Callaghan: Okay, very helpful. Thanks Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Hi, thanks. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning, hi. Just firstly on the Energy, just talk a little bit about what price degradation you assume in the business this year. And also on automation you made very, very small adjustments organic growth a very large adjustment to the assumption for drilling and production. So why do you feel confident in the automation can hold up at around flat? Robert Livingston : Okay, there is part of the automation product portfolio that actually deals with drilling and with some down-hole monitoring. We do anticipate a decline in that part of the automation portfolio, when you move beyond that specific product area in our automation portfolio, we actually don\u2019t anticipate much of a decline in automation. In fact there is a lot of work going on internally right now within this segment and within that business to figure out how we actually grow automation beyond what we have in our guidance in 2015. And we think we\u2019ve get some opportunities to do so, but to be quite transparent, there is part of that automation portfolio, I\u2019m repeating myself, that is, that does have some down-hole applications. And our Bearings & Compression activity that we\u2019ve got fairly aggressive growth plans as well as cost containment activity within both of those business as we grow it in 2015. And we don\u2019t see those businesses being directly impacted by the drop in rig count in 2015. Price, we do have some modest price declines in our plan for 2015. When I say modest - but some of these discussions are still underway, so I would give the nod to the customer let us finish these discussions before I get too specific and responding to an open question like that. But I would tell you for planning purposes, we have low to mid single-digit price declines planned for some of the products and for some of the products nothing, no price declines. And I would say that the activity we\u2019ve encountered here over the last few weeks with our customers gives us some confident that we\u2019ve pegged that number correctly. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then just quickly on the Fluids, it\u2019s hard from the outside to get a sense of the different end-markets in that. Any thing you\u2019re seeing that sort of changed or is interesting versus what you said at Dover Day? Robert Livingston : No, in fact I think I commented, made that comment as I had my prepared remarks within Fluids, within Engineered Systems and within Refrigeration. We\u2019ve made no changes and need to make no changes to our growth plans for 2015 beyond what we shared with you at Dover Day. Fluids it\u2019s an amazing year they had in 2015 with 8% organic growth for the entire segment. And it wasn\u2019t an unbalanced year for that segment, both fluid transfer, as well as our pump businesses did quite well in 2014. And we\u2019re expecting both of them to continue with growth initiatives and growth results in 2015. Julian Mitchell : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Steve Winoker : Thanks, good morning all. Robert Livingston : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Steve Winoker : Just a question on the flip side here so you are taking headcount down 14% in Energy it sounded like, what happens if and when oil prices go backed up and if that were to happen in the six months or nine months how long does it take you to cycle through this between you\u2019ve got your \u2013 the impact which you haven\u2019t even said you mentioned that you\u2019re just starting to see barely now, you are anticipating that. And this could be a little shorter lived than people think. So how are you dealing that with your scenario planning how it is compared to what you did last time? Your ability to - on the positive side of this is probably a nice thing to think about what would happen in the other end, your ability to make your commitments? Robert Livingston : So I take it by the tone of your question that you are long on oil and you are very short. Steve Winoker : Yeah, no, it\u2019s not. Let\u2019s not look at presumption in scenario planning here. Robert Livingston : Look it\u2026 Steve Winoker : So it\u2019s a bottom for everything right? Robert Livingston : Well I know it. It\u2019s interesting that you asked the question that way because and how honest that we talk about that quite a bit when we go through our planning scenarios. I would just remind you that someone, one of their earlier questions was, are we using the same playbook from the 2008, 2009 time frame and in many instances we are, that\u2019s where we are sort of where we start. And we had a pretty quick bounce in 2009 both on the oil price after it hit its bottom and then a pretty rapid increase in rig count deployment as we went through 2009 and 2010. And I would tell you that we were able to bring employees back, quick enough we were able to bring on new employees, quick enough and to get them trained that our customer service activity, which is always the thing we want to pay attention to, our customer service activity levels were quite high and we did not disappoint customers. And that the other day that\u2019s sort of what guides our decision. Steve Winoker : And Bob you guys take advantage of M&A in these kind of environments, usually this is your prime time just sort of have a longer view of the cycle I guess in that same way. You still, its hard to get comfortable right now, right? But how are you starting to think about that trade off and buybacks versus M&A, you probably just lifted your buyback may be give us some color. Robert Livingston : Okay, so we - let me deal first with the M&A question and then you tied into share repurchases. M&A in Energy, gosh! I would tell you that I\u2019m not speaking for anyone other than Brad and I. M&A activity in the Energy sector in the next three or four months, I\u2019m going to use your phrase, could be a bit uncomfortable. Simply because of the uncertainty as the timing, the uncertainty as the debt and then even after the price of oil does recover and start to find a new normal that\u2019s higher than where it is today, is what\u2019s going to happen with investment activity in the U.S. shale fields and I think that\u2019s to me, that\u2019s the more larger question. But I think as we get through perhaps not the first quarter, the first quarter is probably not going to give us enough information. I think as we get through the second quarter or into and through the second quarter, I guess that not only us, but others in this sector may have a comfort level that\u2019s being developed, that would allow us to make a decision or two on M&A. And if the opportunity is right for us, I\u2019m going to tell you, we\u2019re going to look at it. But the comfort level is pretty high for the next three months to four months. On share repurchase activity, don\u2019t think that our share repurchase activity in 2015 is a diminishment of our ability to execute on M&A. And Brad can give you a lot more detail on this than I will or I could. But in real simplistic way to look at this our share repurchase activity in 2015 is going to be funded by divestures. Said and done. We\u2019re not increasing any debt on our balance sheet to fund share repurchase activity, we\u2019re not using operating cash flow to fund share repurchase activity. I closed my prepared comments with our plan is to grow, well that\u2019s part of our growth agenda. And as opportunities come forward we will execute. Steve Winoker : Okay, thanks guys. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Robert Livingston : Hi Steve. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Just a question on the \u2013 what degree of pricing you said low-to-mid in some of your business flat in other part in energy. What\u2019s kind of the total is it, does that all mix in the kind of 50 bips of the price pressure they you\u2019re assuming? Brad Cerepak : Well again I\u2019m going to repeat myself on two points. One, we\u2019re still in discussions with customers so I\u2019m going to treat some of this as confidential discussions with customers right now until we complete some of these dialogues. I\u2019m saying that in our plan where we do anticipate price reduction discussions with customers that the low-to-mid, I\u2019m talking to 2% to 5%. Brad Cerepak : Part of the portfolio. Robert Livingston : One of the portfolio is included in our guidance. Steve Tusa : Okay, what\u2019s the\u2026 Robert Livingston : And I would also tell you Steve, there is just as much activity going on by us to offset that with input cost. Steve Tusa : Sure, in the gross margin of Energy\u2026 Robert Livingston : I have a suggestion for everyone that\u2019s listening, I don\u2019t think this is going to be a big item in 2015. Steve Tusa : What\u2019s going to be the pricing? Robert Livingston : The pricing is not going to be a significant item for Dover in 2015. Steve Tusa : What does that does 2016? Brad Cerepak : You should not give any guidance of 2016. Robert Livingston : I\u2019m not giving guidance of 2016. Steve Tusa : Okay. Is the gross margin at Energy I would assume it\u2019s above the company average. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Yes, that\u2019s true. Robert Livingston : Yes. Steve Tusa : And is it meaningfully above the company average. Brad Cerepak : 300 basis points, 250 basis points. Steve Tusa : Okay. So basically, we should think about it as you are going to convert there kind of less than gross margin given the cost take out with kind of pricing TBD around that? What do you think is going to be kind of flat, I guess this year? Robert Livingston : Well, I don\u2019t know its TBD, but I would say your first assumption is correct that we will convert and I said earlier I think 30% decrementals is the way we think about it. So therefore, we are converting on the downside at less than the gross margin because the cost takeout, that\u2019s the thing. Steve Tusa : Right, okay, that makes some sense. Robert Livingston : That\u2019s all in there Steve. Steve Tusa : But what are the - so you guys - one more question just on the cash flow stuff. Robert Livingston : Yes. Steve Tusa : You announced on Datamax O\u2019Neil I think it\u2019s a $180 - $190 million cash inflow, is there any tax impact on that, so what\u2019s the after tax? And then what are the - are there any other divestitures that you\u2019re planning on bringing cash in for, just on the entire, I guess $600 million in buyback. Brad Cerepak : No. No, no, no others. I would just say generally on both of those that it\u2019s not a lot of tax leakage let\u2019s just say that. Steve Tusa : Okay. So in total those are going to bring in $600 million? Brad Cerepak : Pretty close to that, yes Steve. That\u2019s what our expectation at this point. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closings remarks. Paul E. Goldberg. Thanks Maria. This concludes our conference call. With that, we thank you for your continued interest in Dover. And we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Have a good day. Thanks. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our businesses continue to perform well against the backdrop of significant headwinds in our Energy-related markets, as well as the increasing FX impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar and slower than expected activity in our core retail Refrigeration markets. These headwinds caused our first quarter results to be below our expectations. We continued to take aggressive restructuring actions to better align our costs to anticipated demand, just as we did in the fourth quarter. From a geographic perspective, our non-Energy related U.S. markets moderated, while Europe and Asia were solid. Excluding U.S. Energy markets all regions grew in a quarter. Now let me share some specific comments on the quarter. In Energy, our drilling and production businesses were significantly impacted by a sharper than anticipated decline in the North American oil and gas markets, resulting in customer destocking and lower order activity. In response, we took restructuring actions during the quarter to better align our cost base and we will continue to pursue appropriate cost reductions going forward. In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid organic growth across both platforms. Within printing and identification, our businesses performed very well globally. The industrial platform achieved broad based organic growth lead by continued solid results in our waste handling and auto-related businesses. Our Fluids segment once again performed well. We are continuing strong market conditions for fluid transfer products were primary driver. The majority of our pump markets remained solid. Though, year-over-year comps were impacted by strong project shipments in the first quarter of last year. The Refrigeration & Food Equipment market has remained stable. We expected a slow start to the year based on reduced activity from a key retail Refrigeration customer and volume from other customers has been slower to develop than anticipated. We expect overall customer activity to pick up in the back half of the year. Additionally, our glass door business has remained strong. Our acquisition pipeline rebuilt nicely in the first quarter and is now quite robust. And I am optimistic that we will close on several acquisitions in the back half of the year. In addition, we completed the sale of the business in the first quarter for $185 million and also announced the agreement to sell another for $500 million. We will use the deal proceeds to complete our previously announced $600 million of share repurchases in 2015. Now let me address our revised outlook for the year, which is largely unchanged for Engineered Systems and Fluids except for FX. Their markets have remained healthy and we expect them to have solid growth in 2015. As you would expect, North American Energy fundamentals are having the biggest impact on our forecast. As a result, we expect significantly lower revenue in our drilling and production businesses. Several of our other businesses in our Energy segment are less expose to upstream oil and gas activity, and thus have been less impacted than our drilling and production businesses. Overall, we expect the second quarter to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year for Energy. In Engineered Systems we anticipate continued growth in our industrial platform and strong results in printing and identification driven by new product introductions and positive market dynamics, largely offset by increased FX headwinds. Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for fluid transfer and most of our pumped businesses. Our expectations are supported by ongoing safety and environmental regulations, a positive retail and fueling environment and new pumped product introductions partially offset by the impact of FX. And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we now expect a tougher year driven by lower order activity for our cases and systems. We do expect our glass door, heat exchanger and commercial food equipment businesses to perform well and help mitigate the previously mentioned softness. With that, let met turn it over to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on slide three of our presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 6%, growth from acquisitions of 5%, and an FX headwind of 4%. EPS was $0.72, including $0.10 of restructuring. Segment margin for the quarter was 13.5%, 340 basis points below last year. Adjusting for restructuring and normal acquisition purchase accounting cost, our overall margin was 15.5%. Bookings decreased 11% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, reflecting weak energy macros, softer orders rates in refrigeration and FX impacts. Overall book-to-bill finished at 1.02. Our backlog decreased 13% to $1.2 billion. Free cash flow was strong at $103 million for the quarter or 6% of revenue. For the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 11% of revenue. Now let\u2019s turn to slide four. Engineered Systems grew organic revenue 6% with broad-based growth in both platforms. Fluids grew 2% benefiting from solid fluid transfer markets, partially offset by tough comps connected to a larger order shipped last year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment\u2019s organic revenue declined 7% on tough comps in retail refrigeration and can shaping equipment. As discussed on previous calls, the can shaping business can\u2019t be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but the market remains solid overall. Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 24%. Acquisition growth in the quarter was 5%, comprised of 15% in Energy, 2% in Fluids, and 1% in Engineered Systems. FX impacted to total company by 4% as seen on the chart. Turning to slide five in our sequential results. Revenue decreased 13% from the fourth quarter primarily reflecting weak drilling and production markets, softer retail refrigeration activity, impact of FX, and the timing of pump shipments. Overall Energy decreased 22%, Refrigeration & Food Equipment decreased 19% coming off a strong fourth quarter, Fluids was down 10%, and Engineered Systems declined 3%. Sequential bookings decreased 7%. Of note, Energy declined 22% on weak market fundamentals. Engineered Systems was down 8%, principally driven by tough comps in waste handling. Refrigeration & Food Equipment seasonally increased 14%, although less than anticipated. Now moving on to slide six. Energy revenue of $430 million decreased 10% and earnings of $52 million decreased 56% from last year. Excluding the combined $29 million impact of Q1 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, earnings decreased 32%. Energy\u2019s results were significantly impacted by a steeper and broader deterioration of the North American oil and gas markets than previously forecasted. The result was reduced E&P CapEx spending and significant customer destocking, most notably in our North American drilling and production markets. Solid activity in compression winches ESPs and international markets helped to partially offset challenges in our business. We took additional restructuring actions in the first quarter to better align our cost. Over the last two quarters we have incurred approximately $25 million in charges in our Energy segment. These actions will provide $45 million in benefits this year. In addition, we have taken other cost reduction actions, which should provide an incremental $30 million in savings. Excluding the Q1 restructuring and purchase accounting cost, our adjusted operating margin was 18.8%, reflecting lower volume and modest price declines, offset by the benefits of productivity and prior period restructuring. Bookings were $417 million, a decrease of 13% from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.97. Turning to slide seven. Engineered Systems had another solid quarter, where total revenue of $573 million was up 1% overall, earnings of $88 million increased 6%. Our Printing and Identification platform revenue of $230 million decreased 1% overall. Of note, organic revenue grew 8% but was offset by significant FX headwinds. These results were driven by continued strong digital printing activity and solid global markets in our core printing and coding business. In the Industrial platform, revenue grew 2% to $343 million including organic growth of 4% offset by FX headwinds. Revenue growth continued to be particularly strong in our waste handling business. Margin was up 70 basis points to 15.4% on volume leverage and productivity. A one-time insurance recovery of $4 million largely offset incremental restructuring charges in the quarter. Bookings were $573 million, a decrease of 8% reflecting an organic bookings decline of 3% and 6% impact from FX. Our Printing & Identification bookings deceased 6% to $236 million. However, adjusting for FX, organic bookings were up 3%.Industrial bookings decreased 9% to $337 million, largely reflecting impact of order timing and waste handing and softer markets in a hydraulic cylinder business. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.02, while Industrials was 0.98. Overall, book-to-bill was 1. Now moving to slide eight. Within Fluids revenue decreased 1% to $340 million and earnings of $55 million declined 6%. Revenue performance was driven by organic growth of 2% and acquisition growth of 2% offset by FX headwinds. Our Fluid Transfer businesses continue to benefit from strong demand in global retail fueling markets and ongoing safety and environmental regulations. Pumps results were primarily impacted by the timing of large shipments to customers in the plastic and polymers markets. Segment margin was 16.1%, a decrease of 70 basis points largely reflecting product mix. Bookings were $339 million, a decrease of 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of project-related orders within pumps, partially offset by solid fluid transfer markets. Book-to-bill was 1. Now let\u2019s turn to slide nine. Refrigeration & Food Equipment\u2019s revenue of $372 million declined 10% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 19% to $36 million. Revenue performance in the quarter was essentially as expected. Our results were largely driven by reduced order activity for refrigeration systems and cases by a key retail customer, which offset solid heat exchanger in commercial Food Equipment activity. Operating margin was 9.7%, a 120 basis point decrease from last year. This result largely reflects reduced volume and product mix. Bookings were $420 million, a decrease of 15%, principally reflecting slower and anticipated order activity from our core Refrigeration customers. Book-to-bill was 1.13. Going to the overview slide number 10. First quarter net interest expense was $32 million, in line with our forecast. Corporate expense was $35 million, up $4 million from last year and consistent with expectations. Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 29%, essentially in line with our revised full year forecast. Capital expenditures were $28 million in the quarter. Lastly in the quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares for $200 million. As previously communicated, we will repurchase a total of $600 million in shares this year. Now onto slide 11, which is an update on Energy. We now expect full year revenue for Energy to decline 16% to 18%, a reduction of about 10 points from our prior forecast or about $200 million in revenue with organic revenue declining 24% to 26%. The biggest changes in our Drilling & Production in automation markets and although less exposed, our Bearings and Compression forecast has also been revised to reflect general energy market conditions. Moving onto slide 12, which shows our full year guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be down 4% to 6%. Our expected organic revenue will decrease 2% to 4%. Completed acquisitions will add approximately 2%. We now expect the total impact of FX to be approximately a 4% headwind. Segment margin is estimated to be between 16.8% and 17.3%, excluding restructuring costs. Corporate expense remains at approximately $125 million and interest expense should be around $127 million. We now expect full year normalized tax rate to be approximately 29%. CapEx should be about 2.3% of revenue and our full year free cash flow will be approximately 11% of revenue. From a segment perspective, Energy\u2019s full year organic revenue forecast has been reduced to a negative 24% to 26%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment\u2019s organic revenue forecast is now expected to be negative 1% to 3%. Energy Systems, Engineered Systems and Fluid organic forecasts are essentially unchanged. Turning to 2015 bridge on slide 13. In 2015, we now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring costs to be a $0.01 impact to a $0.02 benefit. Performance largely driven by volume but also including items such as price, productivity and restructuring benefits will reduce earnings $0.47 to $0.58. Within this estimate, our restructuring benefits of $0.31 to $0.33. The benefit of acquisitions already completed will be core to success. Shares will provide $0.23 to $0.24 based on an estimate of $600 million and repurchases in 2015 and the carryover impact of our 2014 repurchases. Interest, corporate, and the tax rate will be in the range of a $0.02 impact to a $0.01 benefit. In total, we now expect EPS to be $4.20 to $4.40, inclusive of $0.15 to $0.18 of restructuring costs. Incremental $0.05 to $0.08 of restructuring costs will mostly impact the second quarter. Regarding the second quarter, we expect revenue to be up 7% to 9% sequentially, largely driven by a seasonal increase in Refrigeration & Food Equipment and a sequential decline in Energy. With that, I will turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments. Bob Livingston : Thanks Brad. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the way our company\u2019s performed in the first quarter in the phase of tough markets. We continue to focus on lean and productivity initiatives across the organization. Through all of our actions, we have better positioned over for both our current demand environment and for margin enhancement over the longer term. With our strong free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet, we have significant capacity to strengthen and build our position within our growth spaces. We remain focused on growth investment, as well as investment and productivity initiatives, including supply chain optimization and shared infrastructure. As I look beyond the current environment in Energy, I\u2019m excited about Dover\u2019s position. We have structurally improved our cost base while at the same time, continued to invest in product development and innovation. These internal initiatives when combined with value-creating acquisitions give me confidence that we will not only leverage volume improvements but also deliver very strong performance. With that, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. And Paul, let\u2019s take some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks Bob. At this point, I would like to remind all our listeners to limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, so we can get more people in the queue. And with that, Angie, if we can have our first question. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning and thanks for detail around the energy markets. Bob Livingston : Good morning to you, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Good morning. So, Brad, you provided some color on 2Q sales, which is helpful but any interesting to call out in terms of the margin and particularly with -- in terms of Energy and also the impact of restructuring payback primarily? Brad Cerepak : Okay. So, you were asking about -- okay. So Q2 margins -- we really not going to get into a discussion on it. But as far as the year is concerned on Energy, we would see the margins continue improve throughout the year as those restructuring benefits begin to take hold. As we said, Q2 will be impacted by further Energy restructuring costs. By the time we exit, we would expect our decrementals in energy to significantly improve. So the first quarter, the decrementals were about 39%. I would see decrementals into the second quarter slightly higher. Let\u2019s say two points higher than that about 41% on Energy. And then for the year, we would see decrementals on our Energy business slightly below 40. We had previously thought that would be somewhere between 30% and 35%, but you know, Nigel, the steepness of the curve and the downturn has been significant. So getting to cost out and holding to those lower decrementals is a challenge right now. Nigel Coe : Right, right. Exactly. So I\u2019ll leave energy that I had. I\u2019m sure other people will come back to that. In terms of refrigeration, obviously a lot of your competitors have been calling out it trends well. So I\u2019m just wondering, I understand some of the commentary around the customers but it seems like a general market pause here. So I\u2019m just wondering what is your perspective on what\u2019s causing this pause? What gives you confidence, it\u2019s going to come back and can you maybe just talk about market share as well? Do you feel you hold market share here? Bob Livingston : Nigel, hi. This is Bob. Nigel Coe : Hi Bob. Bob Livingston : I\u2019m going to add -- I'm going to take you question but I\u2019m going to add something to your earlier question on the energy margins. I will tell you that with everything we\u2019re working on with all of the cost takes out that the teams are working on with all of their product development activity that their teams are working on and the opportunities that they think they have in front of them here over the next two to three months, our objective is to exit the year with something very, very close to 20% operating margin. That\u2019s not the second half. I\u2019m saying exit the year. So I\u2019m really speaking to the fourth quarter. And I think we have a lot of confidence not just here with Brad and myself but with the business team leaders that we can do that with an energy. Refrigeration, I\u2019m -- I have been sort of restrained on talking about this over the past year. But I need to take the refrigeration story back to about this time last year, the April-May time last year. And we received notice from Wal-Mart, who has been a very, very significant and good customer for Dover and for Hill PHOENIX and for Anthony for several years that in their global bid, we were not going to participate in their next cycle for their large format stores. That is starting to show up in our first quarter, first half 2015, full year revenue and order activity. Nigel, the impact of that, it\u2019s -- first off, it\u2019s not all of the business that we enjoy and appreciate with Wal-Mart. I think last year we did about $300 million with Wal-Mart. But it does have an impact on this year\u2019s revenue load with Wal-Mart of about $100 million. We have known that since last spring. We were not sure of the timing of the cutover or the transition and we\u2019ve been working pretty feverishly within the business to back fill and to capture additional market share from other national and regional accounts and we feel good with that progress. But the impact in 2015 on a refrigeration segment is about $100 million reduction with Wal-Mart activity and we feel that we have back fill that with about $60 million to $70 million of new business that we have captured year-to-date though it\u2019s not showing up in our order rates. Nigel Coe : Well, thanks Bob. That\u2019s great color. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Good morning guys. Bob Livingston : Good morning Andrew. Brad Cerepak : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question on pumps. Just want to understand what these delays have to do. I guess, you mentioned chemicals from the guidance that seems that you guys fully expect to get it back, just would like to get more color here? Bob Livingston : Okay. First, I wouldn\u2019t use the word delays. Part of the tough comp and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re referring to in the first quarter is that we had significant project shipments in the first quarter. And if you go back and look at our notes, the notes in the script from last year, I think Brad we may have reported organic growth last year in the first quarter of 12% to 14%. And we told you then it was significantly boosted by project shipments with a couple of our businesses. It sort of -- we went back to -- I think 1% or 2% organic growth rate in the second quarter of last year. And you really have to look at the two quarters as an average to get a feel for the typical run rate for the pumps businesses. You are going to see that again in the first half of this year only it\u2019s flipped. Lower organic growth rates in the first quarter against their tough comp last year. And you\u2019ll see a much higher organic growth rate out of the fluids business and our pumps businesses in the second quarter of this year. Andrew Obin : Got you. So when you say\u2026 Bob Livingston : It\u2019s simply is just a timing of project shipments. I\u2019m sorry. Yeah. Andrew Obin : Got you. That makes perfect sense. The other question I had, a lot of companies are sort of talking about this CapEx delays, sort of, global CapEx delays this quarter. Yet if I look at your printing and ID business, it seems to be doing quite well. Can you just talk a little bit more about this dichotomy between CapEx and maybe something more consumer-driven spending that you were seeing? Brad Cerepak : Well, I think that -- I think you just summarized the difference. I wouldn\u2019t label the bulk of our product -- of our printing and identification business as CapEx. So a piece of it, especially within our digital print business is surely there. But bulk of it being Markem-Imaje, we would not label as typical CapEx spend. It really is an operating expenditure with our customers. We had very strong organic growth in the quarter in that platform 8%. It was across the board with all three businesses. In fact, I think Markem-Imaje, which is obviously our largest business within that platform was 6% organic growth for the quarter. So which -- good quarter and we expect it to continue for the year. We think that\u2019s a very solid business for us for this year. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning. Bob Livingston : Good morning. Steven Winoker : Just on energy, what rig count assumptions are baked into your revised guidance now? Brad Cerepak : Lower than they are today. Steven Winoker : Okay. Brad Cerepak : We have -- let's say as we said here, as we said here in the call, I think the latest data point I have quoting, Steve, I\u2019m quoting a U.S. number. I think as of last week, the U.S. rig count was down to 9.50 or 9.54. While a much, much sharper, steeper decline over the last four months than we anticipated three and four months ago. I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to bottom out. I don\u2019t think anybody does. We feel fairly -- we feel very comfortable with forecast we have for energy for this rig count to go a bit lower. I think I will tell you that if the rig count does pierce below the 900 level, we have additional actions that we need to take beyond what we have contemplated so far in the second quarter. And we will take them. Steven Winoker : Okay. Brad Cerepak : But our -- we feel comfortable right now with the plan we have -- with the plan we have in place and the actions we\u2019ve taken over the previous two quarters, the actions we\u2019re taking here in the second quarter, we feel pretty comfortable that our businesses are right sized to deal with the 900 level or perhaps a bit lower if it pierces that significantly, we have other actions we need to take. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then on pricing, we\u2019re hearing from a number of your peers about pricing pressures from both currency as well as of course in energy that are on the way. And how are you guys thinking about it and seeing and dealing with that? Brad Cerepak : Okay. I have to -- I confess I missed the first part of that question. Can you repeat\u2026 Steven Winoker : I\u2019m asking about pricing pressure that we\u2019re hearing from\u2026. Brad Cerepak : Pricing pressure. Steven Winoker : \u2026that we\u2019re hearing from your peers\u2026 Brad Cerepak : Yes. Steven Winoker : \u2026about and whether or not you are -- whether or not you are seeing anything yet and even if you\u2019re not, you are anticipating it, how are you dealing with it, both currency and energy driven? Bob Livingston : Yes. We are experiencing it, and yes, we continue to anticipate it. I think, everyone, all of the supply base and the -- especially here in North America in the oil and gas market has dealt with, I will use the phrase either price pressure to significant price pressure over the last three or four months from especially the important customers, our larger customers, we\u2019ve dealt with it, we deal with it on a -- in an account sometimes even a field-by-field basis. And it is -- the type of discussion we have varies significantly from product line to product line. And the -- in the first three or four months of this year we have seen more engaging discussions and you could interpret engaging as you wish, but we've been incurred more engaging discussions around our PDC inserts in our Sucker Rod products, more so than some of our other products. We do have price concessions still to be negotiated in our forecast for the year. But I think, the experience we had in the first quarter gives us some confident that we can deal with them and still exit the year at a something close to a 20% operating margin for our Energy business. To size this for you, I think, in the in the first quarter it was, Brad, somewhere around 2% for the segment and -- this is not a product commentary, this is a segment number about a 2% price impact for the segment in the first quarter. And for the entire year we are fully prepared to deal with a 3% to 5% price concession and it is in our forecast. Steven Winoker : Great. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey, Bob, you said the second quarter would be the lowest revenue of quarter for Energy, is that sort of the end of destocking or seasonality or any other reason you feel like at the bottom? Bob Livingston : Yeah. I am going to label it as the destocking impact more than the seasonality of the business, Shannon. I'm -- I would say that for both our PDC inserts, as well as our Sucker Rod business that the destocking we believe we'll see the bulk of the destocking activity occur between February and May. In fact, some of our customers are signaling now pretty strongly that the second quarter will see the end of their stocking activity. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. And then it sounds -- yeah.. Bob Livingston : It\u2019s been insignificant. And I\u2019ll give you one example, Shannon. It's probably been most prevalent within our PDC inserts business. In fact, the first quarter our revenue with our PDC inserts business was down 43%. And I think about two-thirds of that was related to reduce activity in the oil and gas markets here in North America. I think the other one-third was destocking. I think we'll see that continue during the second quarter. But I think by the time we get through the second quarter that we will see the disappearance of the destocking activity in the second half of the year. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, in terms of capital deployments, you sound pretty optimistic about some deals in the second half of the year. Any color there on sort of magnitude a focus areas of what you are looking at? Bob Livingston : Well, so you noticed my comment was in the second half of the year, not the second quarter. So, obviously, nothing is close to closing right now, so I'm going to defer any specific color and size comments perhaps until the July call. We are fairly -- we\u2019ve got a fairly active pipeline in three of our four segments, the one being absent is Energy and it's not that we would not be interested in adding to a couple of product areas, especially around automation. But the -- I would say, there\u2019s been a scarcity of attractive properties and businesses that have come to market here in the first four or five months of the year. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Wright with Nomura Securities. Jonathan Wright : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Bob Livingston : Good morning. Jonathan Wright : Can you just talk me through on restructuring size for Energy? How\u2019s this playbook evolve, can you talk through, what the first place you go to in 4Q, is it way you look to expand that through the course of the year, just closing service facilities, how do you -- where would you go as the sort of downturn evolves? Bob Livingston : Okay. So you want me to go back to the fourth quarter. Jonathan Wright : Well, just talk through the, what\u2019s the initial response than incrementally what can you add on to take cost out of the business? Bob Livingston : So let\u2019s say from the beginning of the fourth quarter through the end of the first quarter headcount reduction within Energy is slightly over a 1000 employees and I don't have the exact number. But I do know it's like 15.5% of our employee base that existed at the beginning of the fourth quarter. In the early days and I would label that as a fourth quarter most of those headcount reductions, I would say, were, well, like not all hourly, but it was really related to reducing output capacity that we were anticipating. So let\u2019s call it variable type of activity. And we\u2019ve seen a much healthier -- heavier load here in the first quarter on SG&A. The one thing we haven't touched yet and I want to emphasize this, I want to emphasize both parts of that statement. We haven\u2019t touched and then yet is product development in R&D. And we have been, I have been, we\u2019ve all been rather moved to reduce the ongoing product development and innovation work we are doing within, within these key businesses. As I mentioned earlier, if we see rig count prepares the 900 level and drops significantly below that, then I would say we start to look at some other cost decisions that up until now I have, we have been reluctant to pursue. Jonathan Wright : Okay. Great. That was perfect. On the Fluid transfer size, I think sales growth adds, still looking very strong. Is there any risk to OPW from the four O'Neil pricing, some of that railcar business, is there any change in customer behaviour within the Fluid transfer fees? Bob Livingston : Yes, a little bit, we have. I don't remember now the exact numbers but we actually have taken down our expectations in the second half of the year on our -- both our over the road as well as rail cargo activities that\u2019s related to rail transport. It's not a significant piece of our business. In fact, I would give you this data point for the entire segment, not just fluid transfer. This is for the entire segment of Fluids. About 10% of the Fluids revenue is exposed to let\u2019s see -- I guess the right phrase here is oil and gas oil & gas upstream CapEx activity. And that 10%, it\u2019s about half in North America and about half outside of North America. We have seen a little bit of that decline, especially within our pumps business in the first quarter. We think we\u2019ve had that decline appropriately sized and anticipated for the balance of the year. But even with that, we see strong growth potentials in some of our other markets and verticals. And we\u2019ve got a fairly health organic growth rate, not just for fluid transfer but for the entire segment, for the year. We feel pretty comfortable with this segment. Jonathan Wright : Thanks. Great. Thank you, Bob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Thank you. Bob Livingston : Hi Julian. Julian Mitchell : Hi. You called out mix as a margin headwind in all the segments except Engineered Systems. I guess within Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment in particular, how quickly do you think that mix headwind on margins can reverse? Bob Livingston : Well. Okay. Let\u2019s deal with it, I guess specifically within Fluids. Brad may be able to size this better than I can. I\u2019m sitting here doing just for recall. But the mix would be yes. The margins were down a bit because of mix. But we are not talking a 150 basis points or anything think like that. I think we are talking maybe 20 or 30 basis points on mix, so it was rather modest. And it will just -- it just work its way through the product line. There is nothing unique or nothing alarming in the first quarter activity. Julian Mitchell : I think it\u2019s sort of a tough comp. Bob Livingston : Yeah. It has a lot more to do with the tough comps from the first quarter of last year. But let me give you a commercial or an advertisement here for our performance in Fluids. Margins in the first quarter, I think were 16 in a fraction. Operating margins, we do have in our objective for the year, operating margin for the Fluids segment to be 20%. And we know that\u2019s a tough reach for the business teams. But we believe we will be very, very close to the 20% operating margins for the year. And you are going to see some rather market improvement in margins from the segment, especially in the second and third quarters. Julian Mitchell : Great. And then just circling back to capital allocation, just the size of what you think you can spend. I mean is it fair to say that you are looking to deploy this year the free cash flow after dividend and the sort of $100 million or so extra from divestment proceeds? So that\u2019s maybe $600 million plus you could use on deals in the second half? Bob Livingston : Okay. Look, let me just tweak that statement. You should look at the share repurchase activity for this year. And my goodness, we\u2019ve said these six times over the last two quarters that the number will be $600 million. It\u2019s primarily being funded by divestiture of the two businesses that we have announced here in the first quarter, one that\u2019s closed in the first quarter and the second one that will close here sometime in the next few weeks. So that\u2019s really funding the share repurchase activity. So after CapEx and after dividends, we still have a fairly healthy cash flow that\u2019s available for M&A allocation for the balance of the year. And Brad and I will go in a room and arm wrestle as to how much more he allows me to spend if the opportunities present themselves. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Nathan. Nathan Jones : Who usually wins the arm wrestle? Brad Cerepak : Bob does. Bob Livingston : You have to understand. I\u2019m right handed and Brad is left handed. We do arm wrestle with the right hand. Nathan Jones : Just following on to your answer to Julian\u2019s question that with the 20% targeted margins for Fluids from the year, 16 and a fraction in the first quarter, there looks to be some seasonality in the margins in 2Q and 3Q. But that\u2019s a pretty healthy target. Can you maybe give us some more color on how you get to 20% for the full year? Bob Livingston : Actually, there is a little bit of seasonality in the Fluids business. We typically see the second and the third quarters being the high revenue quarters for the entire segment and that will hold true again this year. So some of the -- some of it will come from growth and volume leverage, some of it is the increased revenue level we see in the second and third quarter. But here I\u2019ve got -- I have to give credit here to the business team and to our segment leadership team, very, very focused on productivity and cost takeouts as we grow the business. And we are making very good progress there. There is no silver bullet. It\u2019s just a lot of blocking and tackling and good execution on productivity. Nathan Jones : So you would say then it\u2019s primarily cost out and productivity improvements and that is things that are in your control? Bob Livingston : Yes. The volume, the organic growth rate for the segment for the year is 5% to 7%. That type of volume on top of our productivity initiatives is a pretty powerful combination. Nathan Jones : What\u2019s your level of confidence that actually making that? I know you said it was a bit of stretch goal at actually making that 20% for the full year. Bob Livingston : I feel fairly confident sitting here today. Nathan Jones : Okay. Fair enough. If we just look at the drilling and production business again here, can you maybe talk about the difference in the pricing pressure at US Synthetic versus the artificial lift businesses given the steep decline in US Synthetic at the moment? Bob Livingston : Well, it\u2019s easy for me to give you the example for our PVC inserts because for all intends and purposes, it\u2019s a single product business. You get into artificial lift and my goodness is that the product portfolio there is not just very broad from an application point of view, it\u2019s pretty broad from a -- it\u2019s even broader from a product point of view. I did state earlier that up until now we\u2019ve seen the bulk of the price pressure and I\u2019m not saying the bulk of the discussions but the bulk of the price pressure to be most evident around PVCs as well as sucker rods. And I would expect that statement to hold true for the second half as well. Nathan Jones : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Bob Livingston : I really don\u2019t want to talk about the pricing on specific products. Nathan Jones : Okay. And just a quick one for Brad, is there any of the step-up purchase price accounting left to get through and accelerated in the second quarter? Brad Cerepak : No. Mostly it\u2019s behind us. Again, this was the inventory turn in the fourth quarter of 2014 into the first quarter. So that\u2019s behind us at this point in time. Nathan Jones : Okay. Thanks very much, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Jeff. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Just wondering if you could touch based a little bit on the change in automation. And I guess there is a couple threads to my thought, but we\u2019re seeing these stories out of Baker Hughes and others about wells being drilled and not completed and kind of decontenting and the like. Is that what is going on with the automation business? Or is it just simply kind of the first rig count as we\u2019re just catching up with the business? Bob Livingston : Well, I think it\u2019s both of those items. I see different statistics. The latest one I saw, I think over the weekend was an estimate that perhaps as many of the -- even with the reduced activity environment that we\u2019re in that perhaps as many as 20% of the wells that were drilled in the first quarter are waiting to be completed at some future date. So obviously that has some impact not only on our artificial lift business but also on our automation business. There is a little bit of a detail here that I think is important to understand that there is one product area within our automation portfolio that I would label it as being down-hole. Everything else all over other product offerings and productivity packages and solution offerings are all top of well or field type of automation products and solutions. The one product that is down-hole has probably seen a decline similar to what I shared on the earlier question, similar to what we\u2019ve seen with our PVC inserts, it\u2019s in the 40% range, Jeff. Brad Cerepak : Clearly, I would add there, Jeff, that we thought this business would be more resilient because of the expectations around productivity at the wellhead and continued completions which \u2026 Bob Livingston : And we still believe that. Brad Cerepak : And we still believe that and we just think it\u2019s is a bit delayed. Bob Livingston : We\u2019ll see. It\u2019s with the significant inventory of uncompleted wells. The one thing I will share with you Jeff is that we are not forecasting -- we are not forecasting a sudden surge in the second half of these uncompleted wells coming online to be completed. We have not forecast that with our automation business and we have not forecast that with our artificial lift business. Jeff Sprague : So that should imply that drilling should fall further, right if people are not going to\u2026 Bob Livingston : No doubt, but I will tell you. Brad made a comment that our energy segment in the second quarter will be the low quarter of the year. And from a revenue perspective, we see a further drop in the second quarter in both drilling activity as well as our artificial lift activity. That said because of the significant amount of destocking, we actually believe we\u2019re becoming convinced that there is going to be a slight recovery. And I emphasize the word and I put it in caps, slight recovery in our drilling activity in the second half of the year. And I think it\u2019s we just look at that as this destocking activity for PDC Inserts. Jeff, I cannot emphasize how significant it has been in the last couple of months. And further destocking anticipated here in the second quarter but we do believe it comes to an end here with the second quarter. Brad Cerepak : I think it\u2019s been steeper. Bob Livingston : Yes. Brad Cerepak : And more significant than what we saw during the recession time. Bob Livingston : Correct. Brad Cerepak : And then attributable in my mind to this destocking, right. Jeff Sprague : And just a follow-up back to fluids then? Bob Livingston : Back to what? Jeff Sprague : Back to fluids. Bob Livingston : Fluids, yes. Jeff Sprague : Yeah. So in December you were guiding margins up 80 to 100 basis points and I\u2019m not sure exactly what the date is, right? There\u2019s a few things moving around but the organic growth, look it\u2019s about the same. Can you just give us a little bit more -- I mean, you always have seasonality, right. I mean, what is that would drive such a step function change in your view on margins and fluid. And is 20% in your guidance or that\u2019s an aspirational target? Brad Cerepak : I think embedded in our guidance is an execution on margins that is very, very close to the 20% number that I told you is our objective. Brad Cerepak : Yeah. its about of 80 basis point from give or take, 50 to 80 basis points from where we were in the last guide is really driven by -- like Bob said, execution and productivity initiatives. And we did take some restructuring in this segment and have been working on our cost for the last two quarters \u2026 Bob Livingston : Even longer. Brad Cerepak : \u2026.little bit longer and I think that\u2019s going to show. Jeff Sprague : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I know we covered a lot of ground here. Just looking back, Bob, at your comments, I\u2019d be interested in hearing any additional color regarding that last business with Wal-Mart. I know what happened a while ago but you gave us some insight there but maybe just reflect on why did you miss that business? Were there any lessons? And then the new business you\u2019ve got, the $60 million to $70 million with those new customers. And just any kind of color there would be helpful? Thanks. Bob Livingston : So to put it pretty bluntly, Deane, when we went through -- when our teams went through that global bid exercise and let say that would have been --and oh gosh, second half of \u201813 even though we were not informed of the customer decision until the spring of \u201814. We made a decision we did not want to chase the price down as low as the price was going. It was really that simple. It was not a product decision. It was not a feature decision. It was not a capacity decision and it was not a technology decision. It really was a pricing decision. I want to put this in a broader context here. I\u2019ve shared with you what our objective is as we exit the year on margins for energy and I told you what our objective is for the year on margins for fluids. We continue to make very, very good progress within the businesses and the segment within engineered systems on margin improvement and this has been a significant discussion with the leadership teams within refrigeration and fluid equipment to improve the margins. And you\u2019ll see a little bit of an improvement in margins with refrigeration and fluid equipment this year, I think we have more to do. And I would like to think as we go through. As we go through 2015 and \u201816, you will see us execute on that objective on margin improvements within refrigeration. And at the pricing level that was being offered or I would, maybe more appropriate put it at the pricing level that this order activity, this award was led at, we just found it unattractive. Deane Dray : That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ve already spent a lot of time for questions and answers. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : Thanks, Angie. This concludes our conference call for the first quarter. And with that as always we want to thank you for your continued interest in Dover. And we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Have a good afternoon. Thanks. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s first quarter 2015 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Let me begin by saying that the Energy markets have been more challenging than we anticipated, and the impact on our results have been quite significant. I do believe we are taking the right actions to address the current environment. And I am confident we will improve our performance in the coming quarters. Now, let me share some comments on the quarter. We face tough markets in the second quarter which included diminished demand and significant inventory reductions in our North American Energy markets. We also saw reduced activity tied to customer capital spending in retail refrigeration and oil and gas related pump markets. Regarding our Industrial platform, the U.S. was very solid, partially offset by some softness in Asia and Europe. These factors more than offset the cost containment actions we've been able to achieve and the very solid results we're seeing in Engineered Systems and Fluids. From a geographic perspective, our U.S. activity declined, largely driven by our exposure to oil and gas markets. Our Asian activity also declined on tough comps and food equipment, and reduced industrial capital spending in China. Overall, Europe remains solid and grew organically in the quarter. Now, some specific segment comments. In Energy, our drilling and production and automation businesses were significantly impacted by the severe North American oil and gas market declines. We also saw some weakness in energy-related bearings markets, while our compression business held up well. In Engineered Systems, we achieved solid organic growth across both platforms. Within Printing & Identification, our businesses again performed well and the Industrial platform achieved overall organic growth of 3% led by solid results in our waste handling business. Our Fluids segment had a strong quarter where market conditions for fluid transfer products were solid and we had strong shipments in our project-related pumps businesses. Fluids segment margin performance was excellent at 20%. Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, retail refrigeration results were soft. We expected activity to replace previously lost volume to be more robust at this stage of the year. I am encouraged that bookings improved at Hillphoenix as we moved through quarter. Additionally, our glass door business performed well, leveraging their broad customer base and leading technology. Our acquisition pipeline developed nicely in the second quarter and we have the opportunity to close on several bolt-on acquisitions in the second half of the year. Now, let me address our revised outlook for the year. Within Energy, we remain cautious and have adjusted our full-year forecast to reflect the weak second quarter and continuing low demand levels in the second half. On a positive note, we believe we are at the very beginning of a change in direction for our drilling business. Specifically, we saw drilling bookings stabilize and slightly improve off a low base as we exited the quarter. In addition, we have been actively expanding our customer base and select product categories and gaining business with new products and technology. In Engineered Systems, we anticipate growth across both platforms. In Printing & Identification, we continue to win business globally, and organic growth should remain very healthy. In the Industrial platform, we expect second half organic revenue growth to remain solid, quite similar to the first half supported by strong U.S. markets. Regarding Fluids, we believe the solid global markets will continue for fluid transfer and most of our pumps businesses, and margin will remain strong in the second half. Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we have lowered our forecast due to reduced expectations at Hillphoenix. However, we do anticipate our glass door, heat exchanger and commercial food equipment businesses to perform quite well in the back half. With that, let me turn it over to Brad. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on slide three of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 10%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of 4%, and an FX impact of 4%. EPS was $0.97, including $0.01 of restructuring. Segment margin for the quarter was 15.6%, 300 basis points below last year. Bookings decreased 14% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, largely reflecting weak energy macros and softer capital spending in retail refrigeration, oil and gas exposed pump markets, and our industrial businesses in Engineered Systems. Overall book-to-bill finished at 0.98. Our backlog decreased 17% to $1.2 billion. Free cash flow was strong at $175 million or 10% of revenue. For the full year, we expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 11% of revenue. Now, let's turn to slide four. Fluids' organic revenue grew 6%, benefiting from solid fluid transfer markets. Engineered Systems grew organic revenue 3%, reflecting solid growth in both platforms. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 12% on slower spending by our retail refrigeration customers and tough comps in our can shaping equipment. Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 34%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth was 4% while FX had a negative 4% impact. Turning to slide five and our sequential results. Revenue increased 3% from the first quarter, primarily reflecting normal seasonality, largely offset by Energy. Overall, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 20%; and Engineered Systems and Fluids were both up 3%; Energy decreased 15%. As we discussed earlier, the decline into the second quarter in Energy was deeper than expected. Sequential bookings decreased 1%. Of note, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 16% as we began to see orders for Hillphoenix improve, as we exited the second quarter; Engineered Systems and Fluids both declined 2%; while Energy declined 17%. Now, on slide six. Energy revenue of $366 million decreased 24%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $41 million. Energy's results were impacted by the steep deterioration in oil and gas markets, most notably in our North American drilling and production and in our automation markets where we continue to be impacted by diminished demand and significant customer destocking. However, international activity continues to be an area of opportunity for us and held up well in the quarter. We incurred an additional $3 million in restructuring costs in the second quarter and expect to take another $6 million to $7 million in charges in Q3 to further reduce our costs. Excluding the Q2 restructuring cost, our operating margin was 12%, reflecting significantly lower volume and price declines, partially offset by the benefits of productivity and prior-period restructuring. In 2015, we expect to take almost $90 million of costs out of this segment, a majority of it permanent, to better position us for the future. Bookings were $345 million, a 28% decrease from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.94. Turning to slide seven. Engineered Systems revenue of $593 million declined 3% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 3%, offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $97 million decreased 5%. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $230 million decreased 9% overall. Organic revenue grew 4%, driven by solid global markets for our core printing and coating business. In the Industrial platform, revenue was essentially flat at $363 million and includes organic growth of 3%, driven by growth in our vehicle service and waste handling businesses, partially offset by softness in Asia and European industrial markets. Margin declined 30 basis points to 16.3%, primarily on business mix and the impact of FX. Bookings were $560 million, a decrease of 8%, reflecting an organic bookings decline of 2% and a 6% impact from FX. Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 3%, while Industrial bookings decreased 5% on softness in Asia and Europe. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98, while Industrial's was 0.93; overall book-to-bill was 0.94. Now, on slide eight. Within Fluids, revenue increased 2% to $352 million and earnings of $70 million, increased 11%. Revenue performance was driven by organic growth of 6% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by FX. Our fluid transfer businesses benefited from strong demand in global retail fueling markets in ongoing safety and environmental regulations. Pumps results reflect strong shipments of project-related orders and favorable comps. Segment margin of 20%, an increase of 180 basis points, largely reflecting favorable product mix and leverage on volume. Bookings were $334 million, a decrease of 11% overall, or 9% organically. This result primarily reflects softness in our oil and gas related markets within pumps and the timing of project-related orders. Book to bill was 0.95. Now, let's turn to slide nine. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $448 million, declined 14% from the prior year. Earnings decreased 23% to $66 million. Revenue performance was impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer, as well as lower than expected shipments to other retail customers. Also impacting results were tough comps in our can shaping business. Operating margin was 14.7%, a 160 basis point decrease from last year. This result largely reflects reduced volume and product mix. Bookings were $487 million, a decrease of 10%, principally reflecting slower than anticipated order activity from our core refrigeration customers, partially offset by robust food equipment orders. Book to bill was 1.09, supporting an anticipated better second half. Going to the overview, now, on slide 10. Second quarter net interest expense was $32 million. Corporate expense was $20 million, down $9 million from last year reflecting broad cost management initiatives and reduced compensation expense. Our second quarter tax rate was 29.3%. Capital expenditures were $44 million in the quarter. Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for $300 million and have repurchased 500 million year-to-date. As previously communicated, we expect to repurchase a total of 600 million this year. Moving to slide 11, which shows our full-year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be down 8% to 9%. We expect organic revenue to decrease 7% to 8%. Completed acquisitions will add approximately 3%. We continue to expect the impact to FX to be approximately 4%. Of note, segment margin is expected to be between 16.1% and 16.4%, excluding restructuring costs. Our full-year corporate expense forecast is down $9 million to $116 million, reflecting flow-through of the second quarter reductions. Interest expense should remain around $127 million. We continue to expect the full-year tax rate to be approximately 29%. CapEx remains at approximately 2.3% of revenue, and our full-year free cash flow will be around 11% of revenue. From a segment perspective, Energy's full-year organic revenue forecast is now negative 31% to 32%, a reduction of around 6 points from our prior guidance. Within this estimate, all three end markets have been revised downward to reflect general North American market conditions. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecast is now expected to be negative 6% to 8%, a reduction of 5 points, reflecting slower customer volume in retail refrigeration. Engineered Systems and Fluid growth rates had both been trimmed 1 point off the top end for reasons previously outlined. Turning to the bridge on slide 12. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to be negative $0.02 to flat. Lower performance largely driven by volume declines, partially offset by productivity and restructuring benefits, will reduce earnings $0.92 to $1. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.36 to $0.38. Acquisitions already completed will be $0.02 to $0.04 accretive. Share reduction will add $0.20 to $0.21. Interest, corporate and the tax rate will be in the range of $0.01 to $0.03 benefit. In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $3.75 to $3.90 inclusive of $0.17 to $0.19 of restructuring costs. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Brad. We clearly have faced some tough market conditions in the first half which will largely continue for the balance of the year. Our teams have managed well through this environment, and I'm confident they'll continue to do so. As I look forward, I see opportunities for improvement at each segment, which should result in better performance in the back half of the year and into 2016. For example, within Energy, I expect drilling destocking to dissipate. We are also aggressively pursuing share gains and expanding our international presence. I am pleased we've been able to grow our share in select product categories over the last year in the face of tough markets, and that we are actively bidding on many international tenders. I expect Engineered Systems to show growth in both platforms and I'm encouraged by a big recent win for waste hauling equipment, as well as a large Navy contract we just secured. Fluids has demonstrated very solid growth in fluid transfer, which should continue. On the pumps side, we continue to grow in international markets as evidenced by an important plastics order we were just awarded in China. And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, I anticipate a better second half on improved order activity at Hillphoenix. Our food equipment businesses will also have an improved second half, boosted by stronger project shipments and new equipment rollouts for a couple of key restaurant customers. With our strong free cash flow and the strength of our balance sheet, we have significant capacity to strengthen and build our position within our growth spaces, and I expect us to complete some acquisitions in the back half of the year. With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. With that, Paul, let's take some questions. Paul E. Goldberg - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Bob. Before we take questions, I just want to remind everybody, as a courtesy, if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, we'll be able to take more questions from more analysts. And with that, Maria, can we have the first question? Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Bob, I guess I'll start with this bottom/inflection point in drilling. I mean, maybe a little bit color on what you're seeing there and are we just seeing kind of an end of the bleeding? Or do you actually see something you like there? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Gosh, Shannon. Right now, it's hard to have rosy glasses when you look at our activity in the energy market. Rig count continued to decline during the second quarter and we track that most closely related to our drilling business, our insert business for drill bits. And we saw the low point in the quarter in the first half of June. The second half of June was up about 10% or 12% over the first two weeks of June. And I would share with you that the order activity in July is up, so far, just month-to-date, is up about 15% above what we saw in May and June. Shannon, I don't \u2013 I'm not attributing that to a market recovery. It does reflect what I believe is the coming to the end of the destocking activity we've experienced with many of our customers. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then on the cost side, why was there only $3 million of restructuring this quarter in Energy? I would have thought \u2013 I mean, last quarter there was, I think, $18 million; you said you're going to do $6 million to $7 million next quarter. Was there a reason that there was a little bit of a lull, I would think \u2013 I would have thought it would have been pretty intense restructuring in the quarter? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, I would tell you \u2013 I think there would be some people within energy that would tell you that there was some intense restructuring, it just didn't cost as much as what we're going to experience in the second half. Brad is going to have to help me here with an exact number, but I think head count was reduced in energy by almost 400 folks in the second quarter. And there just wasn't a lot of restructuring cost associated with those employee reductions. Second half of the year, I think embedded in our guidance is about $15 million of restructuring costs. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Total for the corporation. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, for the corporation. And probably two-thirds of that is in Energy, Shannon. We continue to whittle away at the cost base. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. So it's just how much it's costing to take it out \u2013 that's not aligned exactly with the...? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The restructuring in the second quarter did not include assets. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It was all people related. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Got you. All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Scott. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Scott. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Can you give us a sense \u2013 I didn't see anything in the slides or commentary related to price in the backlog, particularly, in Energy, is there a \u2013 have you hit a point now on where folks who've wanted a repricing have got it, and what you see in the backlog is stable price or are we not there yet? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As soon as I answer the question affirmative, we're going to get another request for another tough discussion with a customer tomorrow, Scott. I believe that the bulk of it is behind us. I think I've shared this on the April call as well as at a couple of conferences that I spoke at during the second quarter that the bulk of the price reduction activity we've experienced in Energy has been in our drilling products as well as our rod products within artificial lift. Not a lot has changed. In our drilling products, it's still going to average for the year about 5%, and that's what we saw in the second quarter. A little bit more aggressive actions that we've taken along with some of the customer demands in rods, and that's probably averaging about 10%. Don't see it being much different during the second half of the year. And the net impact for the segment for the entire year, I would tell you it's still within the range we've been sharing with you for the past couple of calls, which is 3% to 6%, 4% to 6% in that range. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Understood. And on corporate expense, it's down $9 million year-over-year. Is that \u2013 could you give us a sense of how much of that is lower bonus accruals and how much of that is kind of real cost-out? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, yeah. I'll take that question. I guess, Scott, about half of that is us reaching a threshold on our revised guidance whereby the long-term plans won't pay out. And so think about it as half is comp-related; the other half, about 50% of that is real cost takeout. So I would say that's related to our functional cost initiatives around reducing the corporate overhead. And then, we have miscellaneous and other stuff that normally happens in any given quarter comprise the remaining piece of that balance. Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Okay. That's it. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Steve Tusa. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hi, Steve. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : The restructuring dynamics in Energy. Could you maybe just remind us of what the expectation is? What you spent this year? What you expect to book this year in savings? And then, what the carryover is into next year? I think that's kind of an important piece, obviously, in being optimistic about next year. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I'm going to let Brad tackle that one. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Let me start and then you could follow on if I don't hit all those questions. So we're saying $40 million to $45 million total corporation this year in restructuring charges, $0.16 to $0.19 range. Of that amount, we're looking at $27 million to $30 million of that being in the Energy. In terms of the benefits, we continue to see \u2013 by the way, I'll just make mention of this now that, as we continue to work through our restructuring, our benefit estimates have actually come up a little bit since our last forecast, just more confidence around that benefit number. But in terms of Energy, I pointed out in my prepared remarks that we expect to take $90 million of cost out this year. Steve, there's two pieces to that : there's a piece that's funded through restructuring; there's a piece that's just day-to-day initiatives around structure that doesn't cost us effort \u2013 costs us money, I should say, cost a lot of effort, but money. And so Energy will take $90 million out. The run rate on that, obviously, is much more significant. For the total corporation, I would say we're on restructuring. Now, I'm going to go back to just the restructuring piece, $90 million to $95 million of benefits, the run rate will be more like $130 million to $140 million going into next year on those actions. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And of the $90 million, how much is actually from the restructuring? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The $90 million in Energy you're referring to? C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So about $60 million to $65 million. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: $65 million. Yeah. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then I... Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The rest coming through real initiatives around just cutting back the spend levels that \u2013 we expect some of that to be permanent. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And lower product cost. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Right. And I think you said last quarter there were $30 million of temp stuff. Is that still kind of \u2013 I guess, that's what that implies, that's still kind of the number. But you're making that sound like it's a bit more structural perhaps now. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't think that number has changed much now. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then one last quick question just on Refrigeration & Food. The margin has been down in the first couple quarters here. What do you see there for the year? Is there \u2013 I know your volumes maybe return a little bit in the second half, what margin are you expecting in that business for the year? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Gosh. For the entire year, at least 13.5%. It may push 14%, Steve. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : In Refrigeration & Food? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In that segment, yes. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I mean, that's a huge, I think, bump-up from \u2013 I know you had restructuring in the fourth quarter, but, I mean, that's definitely a hill to climb in the second half. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me give you a little bit of color on anticipated second half margins for Dover... C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...which I think would be helpful for everyone to understand. As we look at the second half, we are anticipating operating margins to be up about 250 basis points over the first half. Steve, the bulk of that goes back to your first question. About 150 bps of the 250 bps improvement we're seeing in the second half is the recognition of increased benefits of restructuring and lower restructuring cost versus the first half, and about 30 bps of improvement in the second half from what I would just label as normal productivity initiatives. And then... C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...some improvement in margins from increased volume. We are looking at volume in the second half to be up. I think it's about $130 million over the first half. And we'll see some increased margin activity from that increased volume. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Keep in mind the discussion that Bob \u2013 the numbers he has given you is all to the high end of our guide range, just to be clear. C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks for all the color. It's great to have all these details, and thanks for trying to make a call on some of the stuff that's incredibly fluid over the last couple of quarters. All the detail is very helpful, so thanks. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, guys. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Jeff. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Good morning. Hey, just a couple others, thinking about this back half, you had previously been pretty explicit about how you thought Energy would exit the year. Could you give us that granularity? Also what's embedded in your guide? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. The second half guidance \u2013 second half forecast on Energy \u2013 second half versus first half, Jeff, the revenue is down $40 million, but the second half run rate is fairly consistent with the second quarter. Obviously, that said, that means that the first quarter will be the high quarter of the year for Energy. Three months ago, I truly did anticipate that we would exit the year with a 20% margin in Energy. I still think this business is a 20% margin business. We're just not going to see it in the fourth quarter, not with the volume that we're anticipating now. I think the number we have in our forecast for a fourth quarter exit rate is 15% or 15.5% margins. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : I wonder if you could actually address that kind of earnings power comment in a sense. I mean, it seems as if there is, in fact, some very significant changes going on in the market and how people are approaching fracing, kind of the geological services that Schlumberger and Halliburton are offering to drive the business. It would seem that you're not particularly well equipped to compete with that. I just wonder how you respond to that. Is there things that you need to do with your portfolio? And is there some impairment in the margin rate of this business kind of normalized going forward relative to what you saw historically? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, let me start first by saying we're not really a participant. I shouldn't even use the qualifier, not really. We are not a participant in the fracing market. We'll participate in the drilling activity with the inserts and we'll participate once the well has been fraced. We will participate with whatever technology of artificial lift is appropriate for that well. But in the pure fracing application, that's just not something we participate in. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. I was thinking more along the lines as they get better and better at re-fracing, we're doing less drilling and therefore... Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We're still in the early days of seeing this re-fracing application here in North America. Look, you re-frac, you've got to pull the gear out of that well. And we believe there is an opportunity for us as that gear, as that system comes out or either if it's been downhole a short period of time, a year or so, maybe two years, there's an opportunity for us on the downhole pump, either a service, a repair, a rebuild or a new pump. If it's a rather new well, it would be unusual for the rod strings that need to be replaced. But if it's an older well, we think there's an opportunity that some of these well operators may take and actually replace the entire rod string. It really does depend on the characteristics of that individual well. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And then just one follow-on on the restructuring, the paybacks are really phenomenal. So $40 million to $45 million in spend is driving $90 million to $95 million in benefit, and I heard run rate $130 million. I'm just wondering if you could... Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, $130 million to $140 million. Yes. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : So do you have to get into a heavier level of restructuring, so that I think you've \u2013 I guess what this implies is you've taken out people in places where they're not unionized and you just let them go and there's not a lot of severance and the like, but you need to actually adjust your footprints and get into some more costly heavier restructuring. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. You saw us take some steps \u2013 let's see, did we do this in the fourth quarter? For sure, we did it in our first quarter. You saw us take some steps in our first quarter with respect to footprint consolidation. And, my goodness, I don't remember how many field locations were actually removed during our first quarter. I mean \u2013 but double-digit number of field locations. And with that, you see a little bit of our charge activity related to some asset charges. In the second half of the year, within Energy, you'll see a little bit more activity around, I call it, footprint consolidation. Jeff T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Deane. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Hey. Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : On the refrigeration side, when you talk about the slowly to develop replacement activity, I presume that's what you were trying to fill the hole in the lost Walmart business. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Correct. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : So did you miss out on orders from those customers, like not get that share or are the customers just not ordering? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We don't believe we've missed out on any orders that we had planned for the second quarter. We have seen that activity shift to the right. I'll give you a little color on that, Deane. April order activity wasn't that bad. In fact, it was probably similar to, or maybe even slightly above March activity, as we exited the first quarter. May was a surprise. I don't remember the exact numbers at Hillphoenix, but May order activity may have been down as much as 15% or 20% \u2013 15% from March and April. June came back very strong. In fact, it was not only strong at Hillphoenix, the bookings for the segment in June were the highest monthly bookings we've seen in the last 18 months or 24 months. It was a very, very strong June. And order activity here in the first few weeks of July is quite supportive of our third quarter forecast. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Great. Thank you. And then just \u2013 could you clarify, in the negative preannouncement, you talked about the oil and gas pump market being particularly weak, can you just flesh out that? What exactly did you see, pricing, competitive dynamics? Just anything you could share would be helpful. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. There may have been a little bit of pricing. I wouldn't say there was much difference in competitive dynamics. It was all attributable to the continuing decline in the North America oil and gas market, especially upstream. And I would say we saw a little bit more distributor inventory management in the second quarter than we would have anticipated. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Inventory management by distributors, that isn't destocking? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Destocking by distributors. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. That was the word I was looking for. Thank you. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Next question? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Obviously, you covered a lot of ground already. There's obviously a little... Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're going to cover a lot more with you, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I really just want to dig into some points already covered. And the payback, the first $0.02 to $0.08 (40:51) of payback in your bridge, obviously, you had quite a heavy 4Q restructuring quarter as well. So I'm wondering how much of that is coming from the 4Q restructuring actions rolling forward into 2015, i.e., how much have you already realized in the first half? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. I would \u2013 okay, you're asking how much is the benefits first half versus second half of this $90 million to $94 million we're talking about? Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, I would say in the first half we've seen about $30 million to $32 million of the benefits roll through second quarter, significantly better than first quarter in terms of benefit profile. And then, obviously, the back half gives us the remaining piece with it building sequentially through the year and into next year, Nigel. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And that's within \u2013 that's for the whole of Dover, not just Energy, correct? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's for the whole of Dover. Yes. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. That's very helpful. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And I would say Energy is similar, very similar profile, building sequentially into 2016 with the first quarter being only about $4 million, $5 million of benefits, and then the rest really picking up pace in the second, third, and fourth quarters. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. No, that's helpful. It helps explain the way that it rolls forward. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Let me just reiterate what Bob said. The back half margin profile versus first half is up 250 basis points. 150 basis points of that really is coming from reduced \u2013 right now in our forecast, reduced spending level on restructuring and better benefits. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Right. Okay. And then, the second part of my question is, I think, Bob, you mentioned the second half Energy revenue is similar to the 2Q run rate. And in the past you've said, you expected 2Q to be the trough on Energy revenues. So it sounds like 3Q might be the trough. So if you just clarify that point and then second... Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, actually \u2013 I used a phrase or the script or (43:03) similar, I will tell you that we do anticipate a very slight improvement in Energy revenues in the third quarter and the fourth quarter over the second quarter. And, Nigel, the only difference is we do expect a better revenue profile out of our drilling insert business in the second half of the year versus the second quarter, because we do believe that the destocking by the drill bit customers is almost complete. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And recognizing... Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That truly is the only change in the second half versus the... Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ...second quarter, is a little bit of an uptick in our insert business both from destocking \u2013 but I will also tell you that some of the increased order activity we saw in the second half of June and that we're continuing to see here in July is the result of new products and some new technology that we've delivered to some customers, and the take-up has been rather significant on the new products. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That... Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I will add another bit of color, take the opportunity to do it now. I think in my prepared comments I shared with you the activity we're engaged in with respect to international tenders. We are bidding on and tracking, actively tracking, almost 50 international tenders as we sit here today. The timing of the awards and the actual award amount is a bit uncertain. None of those tenders, none of those tender awards that we could win are included in our second half forecast. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's encouraging. Any way to try and size the impact of the inventory headwinds that you had in the first half of the year, in particular the second quarter? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It's hard to tell. I mean, it's \u2013 all I can give you is some data points. So, for example, if I compare second quarter 2015 to second quarter 2014 year-over-year, the rig count decline was 55% here in the U.S., I'm ignoring Canada. Here, in the U.S., the rig count decline was 55%. Our revenue decline in our insert business was almost 70%. It was that significant, Nigel. Now, that 15 point delta between the rig count decline and our revenue decline, I would say perhaps 4 points or 5 points could be attributable to price. The rest of it \u2013 at least 10 points, at least $40 million or $50 million is attributable to destocking. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, Bob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Joe. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Joe. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: On the Fluids segment, you've talked about an organic growth guide of 5% to 6%. It seems like that's going to imply a bit of an acceleration in the second half on similar comps, and the order trends in the first half were pretty negative. So I'm just trying to understand what the offset is that's driving the confidence and the excellence in the second half. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So organic growth in the first half was 4% for Fluids. We're looking at 5% to 6% for the year. The low point was actually quarter one. Quarter three should look very similar to quarter two. And quarter four may be a little bit better than quarter one. It's how the waterfall looks. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And is there any... Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : We do see a little bit of improvement in the FX hit in the second half of the year. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. But is there anything underlying? It seems like you called out oil and gas softening a little bit within the Fluids segment. So I'm just wondering if there is other end markets that you guys saw some improvement in as we were exiting June or into July. I'm just trying to get a sense for what the underlying trends are. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Okay. Again, I think I shared this data point with the callers on the April call. About 10% of this segment's business base is connected to upstream oil and gas that was weaker in the second quarter than the first quarter and it was weaker in the second quarter than we anticipated. It's not 30% of the Fluids segment. It's only about 10%. Order rates, I would tell you that outside of oil and gas, order rates around the segment were pretty solid with the exception being oil and gas, and the absence of some larger project orders that we would have \u2013 that we did have in our order book in the second quarter of last year. We do anticipate some project wins here in the second half. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Okay, great. And then maybe my one follow-up is, Bob, you mentioned earlier that there were several bolt-on acquisitions that you're working on potentially that could close in the second half of the year. I'm just wondering if you could just provide some more color on potentially size of the acquisitions and what segments you're looking to bolt-on in? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the sizes are, my goodness, anywhere from \u2013 I don't know, the smallest one could be under $20 million; the largest one could be, I don't know, of $300 million or $400 million. And which segments? I think that you'd see the bulk of them in Fluids. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thanks a lot. Just on... Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Good morning. Just on Refrigeration & Food. I guess one sort of shorter-term question just around food equipment, seems that was down sort of high-teens in the first half; maybe just explain a little bit what's going on in the market and your own share position. And then, just more broadly, longer-term, on the segment in aggregate, how you feel about the positioning of where you are in different pieces within it in terms of the ability to drive decent earnings growth from here? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me take food equipment platform first or market sector first. Second half will be quite different than the first half. I would say, in the first half, most notably true in the second quarter, we saw a real absence of what I call the projectivity with our can-making equipment. We see that picking up in the second half. And we have the orders in our backlog to support that forecast. Organic growth in food equipment in the first half was 19% negative \u2013 I'm sorry, 14% negative. In the second half, it's a positive 9%. That's how much of a true change there is within this platform from first half to second half. A big boost in the second half is the rollout. We are currently engaged in right now with two key customers on some restaurant equipment and that will have a rather significant impact on the growth rates in the second half. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I would add \u2013 to reiterate what you said, Bob, we have good line of sight in the second half of the food equipment. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Very good line of sight, yes. Second half versus first half in the refrigeration piece of the segment, what is the revenue growth? I think first half \u2013 second half over first half, the revenue growth in that part of the segment is \u2013 I think it's $50 million. And given the backlog that we ended the quarter with, given the order rates that we saw in June and the activity we're seeing here in July, I will tell you that our third quarter factory load is pretty solid to support that forecast, and we have lowered our expectations for the year. I think we have set a bar that we can hit here for the second half of the year in this segment. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Got it. Thanks. And then just to follow-up on Fluids again, how much of your second half sales are in your backlog today? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Oh, Gosh. I don't have that number. Let's see. For the whole segment, it's pretty much, I would say, 75% of our revenue, maybe even 80% of our revenue in this segment I would label as quick ship type of sales. The project business may only account for 15% or 20%. And we're fairly comfortable with the order rates continuing in the second half that we've seen here over the last two months or three months. And the project revenue forecast we have in the second half, I think with the exception of one project, we actually have on our order book today. Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : . Our final question will come from the line of Mig Dobre of Robert Baird. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Good morning, guys. A lot have been covered, so I just have one question. Maybe some color on your automation business and Energy. My understanding has always been that that's a, call it, stabler business, if you would, compared to your drilling business and yet we've seen a pretty big sequential downtick there. How should we think about this business in the back half? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: The back half \u2013 Brad, you'll have to help me here with this detail. But I think the back half \u2013 the second half of the year is fairly consistent, similar with the revenue stream we saw in the second quarter. It is down from the first quarter run rate. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): But is it fair for me to think of this business as being inherently more stable than the production business? Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Parts of it would be, but don't lose sight of the fact that there is, oh, Gosh, 20% \u2013 there's 20% of the automation business, maybe a little bit more than that, Brad, at least 20% of the automation business that would be connected to more of the drilling activity than well completion and production monitoring. Mig Dobre - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): I see. Okay. Thanks for the color. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Robert A. Livingston - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Maria. This concludes our conference call. With that, we thank you, as always, for your continued interest in Dover. And we look forward to speaking to you again after the third quarter. Have a good day. Thank you. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's second quarter 2015 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Overall, our third quarter performance was in line with our expectations. Our team aggressively pursued share gains, cost actions and productivity initiatives which helped to mitigate weak global macro conditions. I was pleased we were able to sign agreements to acquire two businesses, JK Group and Gala Industries. These acquisitions are in addition to the previously announced Tokheim deal and are expected to close later this quarter. Each of these companies offer industry-leading products and significantly complement and expand our market positions. Now, let me share some comments on the quarter. We executed well and were able to post solid results. Of note, the sequential rate of decline moderated significantly in our Energy segment while Refrigeration & Food Equipment's results improved sequentially. Engineered Systems and Fluids continued to perform well. Overall, Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment all posted the same or improved year-over-year margin on lower volume. From a geographic perspective, excluding our energy exposure and the tough comps in retail refrigeration markets, U.S. industrial activity was solid. Our Asian and European activity slowed on reduced CapEx spending. Now, some specific segment comments. In Energy, markets remained tough. However, I was pleased with our third quarter results as we posted an adjusted segment margin of over 15%, a 3-point sequential improvement. Our teams executed well on actions to drive sales as well as on broad cost reduction activities. As we enter the fourth quarter, we remain focused on winning new business, maintaining appropriate service levels and continuing to look for opportunities to reduce our cost structure. In Engineered Systems, we achieved modest organic growth. Within Printing & Identification, our businesses performed well in North America but were softer in China. European activity slowed partially due to the timing of order activity. In the Industrial platform, modest organic growth was led by solid results in our waste handling business. Our Fluids segment had a solid quarter, led by our business serving the polymers and plastics market. Fluids segment margin performance was again excellent at over 21%. Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, retail refrigeration results improved sequentially. I am encouraged by some important recent wins for our Hillphoenix business, which should set us up for an improved 2016. Our glass door business again performed well, leveraging their broad customer base and leading technology. Our acquisition pipeline matured nicely in the quarter. And as noted earlier, we have signed agreements for three important acquisitions since our last earnings call, Tokheim, JK and Gala. While all three companies serve different end markets, they all have commonality in that they each complement and expand our presence in key end markets, are highly synergistic and position us to be a more important partner with our customers. In the case of Tokheim, we added leading Dispenser and Systems business to our strong OPW suite of products. Together, we will have the most complete retail fueling solutions available for our customers. With JK, we add a high-growth, market-leading consumable ink business to our already strong digital printing equipment offering. Our customers will benefit from the coordination and technology sharing between JK and MS Solutions. And with Gala, we will broaden our position serving the polymers and plastics markets. The combination of Maag and Gala will allow us to participate in more applications in the plastics manufacturing process and, thus, become an even stronger partner with our customers. In total, we are spending about $1 billion on these three businesses and acquiring about $500 million in 2016 revenue. Excluding acquisition-related costs, we expect about $0.38 accretion in 2016 from these deals on an operating basis. Now, looking to the remainder of the year. Within Energy, we remain cautious and have further adjusted our full year forecast to reflect the recent decline in rig count, as well as softer bearings and compression markets driven by slower OEM build rates. In Engineered Systems, we anticipate modest growth in both platforms in the fourth quarter led by strong results in waste handling and digital printing equipment. Regarding Fluids, though we anticipate growth to slow in the fourth quarter, we expect fluid transfer to remain solid. Overall, we expect to finish the year with segment margin of around 20% driven by the strong focus on cost management and productivity. And finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect normal fourth quarter seasonality off our lower base. However, we do anticipate our glass door, commercial food and can-shaping equipment businesses to perform well. With that, let me turn it over to Brad. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on slide three of the presentation deck. Today, we reported third quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, a decrease of 11%. This result was comprised of organic revenue declines of 10%, growth from acquisitions of 3%, and an FX impact of 4%. EPS was $1.19 and includes $0.05 of discrete tax benefits. Segment margin for the quarter was 17%, 180 basis points below last year. Adjusting for third quarter restructuring of $12 million, margin was 17.6%. Restructuring activities were broad-based and came in toward the high end of our prior range. Bookings decreased 12% over the prior year to $1.7 billion, largely reflecting tough oil and gas markets. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 0.95. Our backlog decreased 20% to $1 billion. Free cash flow was strong at $243 million for the quarter, or 14% of revenue. For the full year, we now expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 12% of revenue, up one point from our prior estimate. Now turning to slide four. Fluids and Engineered Systems both had organic revenue growth of 1%. Fluids benefited from strong project-related shipments. Engineered Systems growth was driven by solid waste handling markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue declined 6%, primarily on reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Weak macros in Energy drove organic revenue down 37%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was 3% while FX had a negative 4% impact. Now turning to slide five and our sequential results. Revenue increased 2% from the second quarter largely driven by expected higher volume in our retail refrigeration markets. Overall, Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 10%. Fluids was flat while Engineered Systems declined 2%. Energy decreased 1% sequentially, reflecting moderation in the rate of decline following sequential declines of 15% in Q2 and 22% in Q1. Sequential bookings decreased 1%, principally driven by normal seasonality of Refrigeration & Food Equipment, partially offset by strong Fluid orders. Overall, Fluids grew 7% resulting from solid fluid transfer activity and robust project-related pump orders. Energy grew 2% and Engineered Systems was up 1%, while Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 12%. Now, on slide six. Energy revenue of $364 million decreased 28%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $49 million. Energy's results continue to be impacted by challenging North American oil and gas markets. Of note, Middle East activity held up well in the quarter and international expansion continues to be an area of opportunity. We incurred an additional $6 million in restructuring cost in the third quarter and are evaluating additional cost actions as we finish the year. Excluding the Q3 restructuring cost, our operating margin was over 15%, reflecting volume and price declines partially offset by the benefits of productivity and previously completed restructuring. Bookings were $352 million, a 33% decrease from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 0.97. Turning to slide seven. Engineered Systems revenue of $579 million declined 5% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 1%, offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of $103 million decreased 5%, reflecting principally the impact of FX. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $228 million decreased 11% due to FX. Organic revenue was flat, reflecting North American growth offset by softer China and deferred digital equipment order activity in Europe. In our Industrial platform, overall revenue declined 1% to $351 million, where organic growth was 1%, offset by FX of 2%. Organic growth was led by our waste handling and microwave component businesses. We incurred $4 million of restructuring costs in the third quarter for actions that will further improve our cost structure. Excluding the Q3 restructuring costs, our operating margins was a strong 18.5%, reflecting the benefits of productivity and completed restructuring, and a positive business mix. Bookings were $565 million, a decrease of 4%, reflecting organic bookings growth of 2%, offset by a 6% impact from FX. Organically, Printing & Identification bookings were up 2%, and Industrial bookings increased 1%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.99, while Industrial was 0.96. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.98. Now, on slide 8. Within Fluids, revenue decreased 3% to $352 million, while earnings increased 11% to $75 million. Revenue performance was driven by organic and acquisition growth of 1%, respectively, offset by a 5% FX impact. Our fluid transfer businesses remained solid, while our pumps results reflect strong shipments of plastics-related project orders. Segment margin was 21.3%, an increase of 260 basis points, largely reflecting favorable product mix and leverage on volume. Of note, deal costs related to recent acquisition activity were approximately $2 million in the quarter. Bookings were $357 million, an increase of 2% overall or 4% organically. This result primarily reflects strong project orders. Book-to-bill was 1.01. Now, let's turn to slide 9. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue of $492 million declined 7% from the prior year, and earnings decreased 2% to $77 million. As expected, revenue was largely impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Our glass door business remained solid and our can-shaping equipment results were improved but were impacted by a delayed shipment at quarter-end which will ship in Q4. Operating margin was 15.6%, an 80-basis-point improvement from last year. This result largely reflects reduced manufacturing supply chain costs as compared to last year and the benefits of restructuring. Bookings were $431 million, a decrease of 6%, principally reflecting slow order activity from our core refrigeration customers. Book-to-bill was 0.87, reflecting normal seasonality. Now, going to the overview slide number 10. Third quarter net interest expense was $32 million. Corporate expense was $26 million, down $2 million reflecting ongoing cost management initiatives. Excluding discrete tax benefits, our third quarter tax rate was 27.3%, reflecting the benefits from restructuring international operations. Capital expenditures were $40 million in the quarter. Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $100 million and have repurchased $600 million year-to-date, completing our repurchase plans for the year. Moving on to slide 11 which shows our full year guidance. We now expect year-over-year revenue to be down 10% to 11%. Within this estimate, organic revenue has been reduced 2 points. It is now expected to be down 9% to 10% for the year. We continue to expect completed acquisitions will add approximately 3% and the impact of FX to be approximately 4%. Of note, segment margin is expected to be around 16% excluding restructuring costs. Our full year corporate expense forecast is coming down $9 million to $107 million reflecting flow-through of the third quarter reduction and a lower run rate. Interest expense remained at around $127 million. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 28.5%, a half point lower than our prior forecast. CapEx remains at approximately 2.3% of revenue and our full year free cash flow will now be around 12% of revenue. From a segment perspective, Energy's full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 33% to 34%, a 2-point reduction from our prior guidance. Engineered Systems' organic growth is now expected to be around 3%, within our prior forecast range. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's organic revenue forecasted is expected to be down 7% to 8%, essentially unchanged from our prior forecast. Lastly, Fluids growth rate has been reduced 3 points to 2% to 3%, driven principally by weak oil and gas markets. Turning to the 2015 bridge on slide 12. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to be $0.02 higher than our prior forecast, and be negative $0.02 to $0.04. Performance largely driven by volume declines and also including $0.02 of deal cost, partially offset by productivity and restructuring benefits, will reduce earnings $1.11 to $1.15. Within this estimate are restructuring benefits of $0.45 to $0.50. Acquisitions already completed will be about $0.04 accretive. Note that this does not include Tokheim, JK or Gala. Share reduction will add approximately $0.21. Interest, corporate and a lower tax rate will be in the range of $0.08 to $0.09 benefit. In total, we now expect 2015 EPS to be $3.73 to $3.80, as compared to our prior forecast of $3.75 to $3.90. This range includes approximately $0.20 of restructuring charges, a $0.02 increase from our last forecast, and now also includes $0.02 of deal cost and $0.05 related to discrete tax benefits. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Brad. Although we have clearly been impacted by difficult market conditions, I am pleased with the way our teams have responded and executed in this environment. We've done an excellent job pursuing revenue opportunities and winning new customers. And we have positioned our company well through aggressive cost management and productivity projects. As I look beyond 2015, I am very excited by the breadth of opportunities across Dover. For example, within Energy, our aggressive pursuit of share gains and expanding our international presence is ongoing as we are currently participating in many foreign tenders. The cost and productivity efforts we have taken throughout the year have permanently reduced the cost structure of the business. Engineered Systems should significantly benefit from their continued focus on productivity, especially the shared service initiative and by their addition of JK. I also believe our waste handling business will continue to post strong order rates. In Fluids, I anticipate continued strong performance largely driven by solid results for our businesses serving the retail fueling and polymers and plastics markets. The results will be nicely complemented by the addition of Tokheim and Gala, respectively. And lastly, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, expected improved performance for Hillphoenix will be driven by retail refrigeration customer wins and share gains, and continued strong performance by Anthony. Our Food Equipment businesses should also be solid, boosted by the rollout of new products. In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for their continued focus on serving our customers and driving results. Now, Paul, let's take some questions. Paul E. Goldberg - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah. Before we have the first question, I'd like to remind everybody, if you can limit yourself to one question with one follow-up, we'll get more questions in, and we have several people in queue right now. So, Laurie, can we please have our first question. Operator : Again, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Thank you. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Julian. Good morning. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi. Just a question around the capital allocation. Obviously, the buyback spend has tailed off in the second half, I guess, in line with the initial plan for the year. M&A now stepped up. So, is that just the sort of the vagaries of short-term timing or is there a more fundamental shift in approach on how you're using the cash? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Don't read any \u2013 don't read into this, any fundamental shifts. Oh gosh, Julian, I think if you look at maybe the last three years, maybe even four years, you'll see our capital allocation has been pretty evenly split between acquisitions and spending on dividends, as well as share repurchases. In fact, I think it's been about 50/50. I'm not going to comment on guidance for 2016, but I would tell you, if you look at the next couple years or three years, I would not expect the capital allocation profile to be much different than it has been for the last three years or four years. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And then, just my follow-up is around the restructuring plans. And you said you'd increased it by a couple of cents for this year. I just wonder if there was a possibility you might have pushed that out more given maybe extra weakness on CapEx outside of the Energy business, and what sort of assumptions you have for organic growth behind that extra $0.02 increase on restructuring. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. So, we have increased our restructuring activity here in the second half. You see it in the fourth quarter forecast. I would also add that even with the restructuring that we have included in our forecast, we continue to look for opportunities to restructure and to reduce our cost base, especially within Energy, but it's not restricted to Energy. If you look beyond 2015, I \u2013 sitting here today, I would tell you that I do expect our restructuring activity in 2016 to be diminished from what you've seen us tackle in 2015, and even in the latter part of 2014. It won't be zero, but I don't expect it to be at the levels we had last year and this year. Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Paul E. Goldberg - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Congratulations on the deal close. You've been pretty active for sure. Can you just maybe just give us some color around... Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : I've been signaling this for the last three months or four months. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I know, but sell side is as cynical as you know. But if you can just give us some color around JK and Gala in terms of growth rates and margin profile, that would be helpful. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Gosh. JK, well, let's see. Of the three, Tokheim, JK and Gala, Tokheim and Gala will both be add-ons to existing businesses within Dover. Tokheim will become part of OPW; and Gala, obviously, will become part of our Maag business. JK will actually be a standalone within our Printing & Identification platform within Engineered Systems. The margins within JK \u2013 gosh, Brad, are they \u2013 they may be the highest margins, operating margins of any standalone business we have in Dover. Is that a true statement? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : I think that would be close to \u2013 that would be true. And it's a consumable business. So, naturally, we have consumables in our Markem-Imaje business. And I would say it's not significantly different than what we see in our other consumables. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Nigel, the margins will be north of 45%, operating margins at JK. At Gala, low-teens. And I'm not even sure they're at low-teens right now. They're \u2013 but we're very close to it, 12%. But we're pretty excited about this opportunity. It's really easy to remind myself that even three-and-a-half years ago, when we acquired Maag, their margins were pretty similar to what we see at Gala today. And the margins at Maag, this year, I think we've \u2013 my goodness, Brad, I think we've improved margins over the last three years by about 600 basis points and that is a rough number. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : (29:12) yeah. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : And don't expect that to happen in 2016, but you should expect us to start that journey in 2016, Nigel. And I fully expect those margins to be reflective, if not accretive, to Maag over the next three years or four years. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the accretion numbers for 2016, I noticed in the PR, you mentioned they don't include interest expense. And I'm just wondering, is that because the phantom mix is still pretty Fluids? No pun intended there, but are you still to decide on the phantom mix? I mean, how should we think about, for modeling purposes, the mix between cash and debt, and then the mix on the debt between term and CP? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So... Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Go ahead, Brad. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Let me take that one. So, let me just start with the deals that we expect to close in Q4. As we sit here today, we will execute those deals with existing cash. And the cash that we generate in the fourth quarter, which will be a very healthy, normal fourth quarter that we see... Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Brad, the two deals we do expect to close in our fourth quarter are JK and Gala. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Right. We are not \u2013 sitting here today, we still don't anticipate closing Tokheim until early in 2016. So for next year, specifically \u2013 so the two deals this year, we'll close with cash and cash generated. As for next year, specifically the Tokheim deal, it depends a lot on the timing. But we expect funding this deal now part cash on hand and some incremental debt, most likely, to your question, using CP. And I would say today, sitting here, we've sized that at a range of somewhere \u2013 less than the purchase price, but somewhere in the range of $300 million to $400 million. Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Bernstein. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks, and good morning. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Just maybe just talk about pricing pressure in Energy and across the other segments. What are you seeing now? You've talked about it in prior calls, a little bit about your expectations. How has that been coming through and what are your expectations going forward? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's really two different topics. It's Energy and then it's the rest of Dover. And in the other three segments, Steve, I would say the pricing has been rather neutral this year. We saw that again in the third quarter. We don't anticipate anything different than that in the fourth quarter. And 2016, though we haven't completed our planning process yet, I would say that our early look on pricing for 2016 would be more of the same. We would expect it to be neutral. We have seen pricing pressure in Energy this year. I think we opened \u2013 help me here, Brad. We opened early in the year or on our first quarter call, guiding price down, expectations of 3% to 5%, I think it was. I think we'll end the year closer to the low end of that range than the high end, Steve. And it truly is \u2013 you truly do see quite a mix on pricing pressure across the various product lines. And it's not much different during the third quarter or what we expect in the fourth quarter than what I've shared before on calls. In our rod business, I think price down activity in the third quarter was about 10% or 11%, which was fairly consistent with the second quarter. In a couple of other product areas, it's mid-single digits. But overall, not much of a change since our second quarter call. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay. And then, on the implied fourth quarter guidance, it looks like your revenue, sequential revenue is declining about 1%. And I think that compares to about maybe 2.5% to 3.5% over the last couple of years, obviously, always different dynamics here. But as you were looking at the sequential behavior across Energy, particularly in the other businesses, is that just indicative of you \u2013 believing that you're pretty close to bottoming out? Or how were you thinking about that? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, look, let me give you an opening comment in response to your question, and Brad can perhaps add some detail. If I use the top end of our guidance range that existed \u2013 that we shared with you on the July call and look at where we are today, you would see that revenues coming down, what is the number, about $150 million or $160 million on the guide, Brad? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : For the second half. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Or during the fourth. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : And I would tell you that if it's $160 million, $60 million of it was in the third quarter, $100 million of it is in the fourth quarter. And it's \u2013 in broad strokes, it's three areas. It's Energy, it's Europe and it's China. And Europe and China touched all three segments. The $50 million to $60 million in the third quarter was fairly modest in Energy. We were probably down maybe $9 million or $10 million below our expectations. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : But up on earnings now. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : But up on earnings, and feel like we were about $50 million short of our expectations in the third quarter in the other segments almost all attributable to slowdown in Europe and China. In the fourth quarter, I would peg that number at $100 million. And I'm \u2013 I think we're recognizing the recent activity, recent trend here in rig counts as we went through the second half of the third quarter. But our Energy revenue forecast for the fourth quarter is down about $40 million or $45 million from where we're looking at it in July, and at about $100 million across the other segments, again, mostly attributable to some slowness we're seeing or anticipating in Europe and China. So, I hope that provides some top line cover, maybe. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: It does. Yes. Absolutely. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Good morning, guys. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : So, Bob, a little follow-up to that one. So, it looks like the Energy revenues will be down sequentially another $30 million or so in the fourth quarter. Do you expect that, that would be the bottom or will it depend... Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : No. That's about $25 million. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : $25 million, okay. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Will it depend on \u2013 will that, do you think, mark a sort of sequential bottom for the business or will it depend on rig count? Where are you with destocking, et cetera? I mean, do you think that will be the bottom or not? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : I think it's going to be dependent upon energy trends. I think we are \u2013 there may be a pocket here or a customer somewhere who still has some inventory that they want to burn off, but I would tell you that the destocking of inventory, we think, is essentially done. We saw a little bit of that in the third quarter. We expected a little bit of that to continue in the third quarter. We did see that. But I think it's \u2013 I think that's behind us. I think the \u2013 I think, again, the best leading indicator that we've been sharing with you here for near-term activity in our Energy business is the rig count. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, in terms of... Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : And you see that almost as quickly as we do. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Right. Yeah. Now, you've had some other dynamics, too. So, I mean at this point, it's pretty much down to that. And so, when you think about next year just in terms of cost-out opportunities across the company, is that still the biggest thing that you could potentially go after, of rig counts or worse, you would take more cost out of Energy or are there \u2013 or will that not be the primary restructuring area next year? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : So, if rig counts \u2013 if we continue to get pressured in our energy fundamentals, we still believe we've got opportunities to take some cost out. Though, Shannon, I'm going to be real direct here; it becomes more difficult as we go into 2016. But it will become \u2013 in 2016, it will truly become trade-offs between lowering cost and maintaining what we would define as appropriate service levels. But we do know we've got additional opportunities to tackle in 2016 if need be. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : But I would... Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : But I'm not so sure I would agree with the other part of your statement that the bulk of our opportunities in 2016 are still within Energy, Brad. I think we do expect our restructuring activity to be less in 2016 than they were in 2015, but the discussions we're having across the board, we have restructuring opportunities that we've identified, some of which we'll tackle here in the fourth quarter, some of which are lined up for the first half of next year across all four segments. Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Good morning, gents. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Jeff. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hey. Good morning. Hey, just shifting over to Refrigeration and Hillphoenix in particular, can you give us any other color on the nature of the customer wins that you're talking about or the size and the impact that this might have on 2016? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I don't want to give you the individual customers, Jeff. I \u2013 as we talk about share gains and business wins, I will tell you what's not included in that would be any change that we would expect to see next year with our customer that we've been talking about all year long, which is Walmart. But when you look at... Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Any downward change. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : ...any downward change. But when you look at the business wins and the share gains that we've experienced and benefited from here in the second half of this year, and look at the carryover into 2016, I would label them mostly regional retailers. And we think we're going into 2016 with about $30 million worth of incremental business from wins that we have earned this year and partly have some of the revenue in the second half of this year, but about $30 million of incremental business into 2016 for these new wins and share gain. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And just shifting to Fluids, you'd historically described the direct oil and gas exposure there as some small side, I think maybe 10%, but you're taking the guide down there. Can you give a little bit of color on how hard those businesses are being hit? Do I have that 10% dialed right? What's going on in that? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : 10% to 12%. And almost all of the, I would call it, the hit or the down cycle in oil and gas is restricted to some of the oil and \u2013 upstream oil and gas activity that our Pumps business participates in. As Brad said in his script or in his prepared comments, the down guide on Fluids is principally oil and gas, but it's not all oil and gas. We are seeing some softness in Europe and China in Fluids as well. And we'll see how the fourth quarter shapes up. I \u2013 the third quarter concerned me a little bit in China. If we were to pull out our project activity, which, as most of you know, can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, if we pulled out our project activity from both the third quarter of 2015 and the third quarter of 2014, revenue was down in China double digits in the third quarter. Not expecting it to be down as much in the fourth quarter. In fact, October and September are telling us it won't be. But I'm still being pretty cautious with respect to expectations in China here in the fourth quarter. But our business... Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : How much? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : ...is down 15% \u2013 almost 15% in the third quarter in China. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : If I might slip in one more quick one. Your comments about Middle East Energy, there's a lot of stories of budget stress and duress there. And where are you seeing strength in the Middle East and how significant is that? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, we have \u2013 I'm not so sure I've got exact numbers that I can recall for the Middle East. I know we have, goodness, more than \u2013 we're participating in more than 50 tenders right now in the Middle East and Southeast Asia, as well as South America. Jeff, three years ago, that number would've been 8 tenders. I mean, it's \u2013 the change has been that significant for us. And I would say more than half, probably two thirds of these tenders, I would describe as Middle East opportunities. And the area that has been the most significant for us in the Middle East over the last three years has been our base of activity in Oman, and then the areas in the Middle East that we service from our base in Oman. And that continues to be quite attractive both here in the second half, as well as expectations for 2016 and 2017. Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey. Good morning. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Steve. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hey, can you just maybe talk about, just kind of reaffirm or provide some color around what the carryover on savings are for next year, again, on these actions, on the restructuring actions? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Oh, okay. I'll start, but Brad's going to have to help me here. So, as I look at it, Steve, I call it some of the self-help going into 2016. I've already commented that our restructuring charges in 2016 should be less than we've incurred in 2015 and 2014. I'm not going to give you that number until we finished some work. But I think we'll be prepared to share that delta with our investors and the analysts at our dinner in December. But on the restructuring activities that we have executed on in 2015, I think the carryover that we're looking at is about $50 million, Brad? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That's correct. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. $50 million. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful. And then just on the Energy, the exit rate for the Energy margin, I'm not sure if you addressed this. What do you expect for Energy margins for the year again? Can you just remind me? Just trying to get a base, trying to get a base for next year, because obviously, 4Q is going to be pretty tough. It's not representative of the year, of course, but maybe just a year. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : I'll give you some color on that to help you with your modeling. The Energy margins for the year is going to be a little bit better than 12%, and this is all-in. Restructuring, this is not adjusted, this is all-in; a little better than 12%. And I think one of the earlier questions was about the decline in revenue. In the fourth quarter in Energy, it's about $25 million. Our margins in the third quarter, all-in, were 13.5%, and will be about 100 bps below that in the fourth quarter. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Any other moving parts or any other segments for the fourth quarter that you want to call out, or is it pretty self-explanatory from a seasonal perspective, and any items to call out within the other segments on the margin front? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : No, there wouldn't be anything unusual to call out. Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hey. Would just like to clarify on the financing plans for JK, Gala. There's a \u2013 in the press release, that last sentence said, interest charges associated with incremental debt financing is not included in the EPS estimates. So, Brad said you're going to be using cash and fourth quarter cash flow. So, you're assuming no cost of financing for these deals? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : For the two deals that \u2013 as I said, the two deals we expect to close this year, there would be no financing related to that. It would be cash on hand and cash flow in the fourth quarter. And just to reiterate, on the Tokheim deal, depending on where we close next year, what we said would be $300 million to $400 million of financing; most likely, I view that as using CP. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got that. And then, also on other and corporate, that $2 million lower this quarter, should we view that as a new run rate for that expense? Anything unusual? Paul E. Goldberg - Vice President- Investor Relations : Is the question on 2016? Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I would say the run rate \u2013 as you know, in earlier quarters, we talked about this current year has impacted our compensation accruals. So, I would expect that you see some of that come back across that corporate number into next year. So, no, I would expect it to go up slightly. Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning, Joe. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, my first question on Energy. Clearly, you guys \u2013 Bob, you mentioned that pricing has been kind of closer towards the down 3% this year. I'm just curious, what are your expectations for pricing in Energy next year? And how are you thinking about the end market across your businesses? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I'm not giving guidance on 2016 yet, Joe. So, you're going to have to \u2013 I'm going to preface my comment by saying, we're still doing a lot of work on that. But I would tell you, at the sort of the high level assumptions we're making, is that the next couple of quarters are probably going to be pretty reflective of what we're seeing here as we end the third quarter and move into the fourth quarter. And I would label that as stability, but at a much lower investment rate and spend rate with our customers. It's a little bit more difficult to call right now, the second half of next year. And we'll give you a little bit more color on that at our dinner in December. But for the first half of next year, without any doubt, we are not planning for any recovery beyond our current run rate in the Energy market. And \u2013 but I would also say we're not expecting or planning for another 10% down either. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. I mean, maybe just following up and asking a question... Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : And your second question was around pricing. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : I would tell you that I'm not sure pricing was going to be much different. I think as we go into 2016, we would continue to see some pricing pressure, especially in the first half of 2016. I'm not sure our guide would be much different than we were providing at the beginning of the year for the Energy segment in total, maybe a 3% price down pressure. And again, you're going to see it scattered around different product lines and regions where some price pressure will be greater than others. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Now \u2013 and that's great color. Thanks, Bob. I think the question I was really trying to get at, in the face of potentially another down 3% pricing year for next year, based on all the restructuring actions that you've done this year, can you guys grow margins? Assuming that there is no fall-off in organic growth, can you guys expand margins in your Energy segment next year? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : No. I'm going to preface this \u2013 what my response, again, by telling you, give me \u2013 give us the opportunity to spend some more time on this between now and our investor dinner in December. And I think that this time allows us to come to grips with a little bit of what we're going to be expecting and planning for in the second half. Now, to your question about margin expansion. As we sit here today, we actually see the opportunity in all four of our segments, to see margin expansion. It will be varied. But I think we can \u2013 in our core business, if you exclude the acquisition activity and aside from JK, the other two acquisitions we've announced do have \u2013 do bring with them, much lower margins than what we have as a Dover average. But in our core business for Dover, we do clearly see the opportunity for margin expansion in 2016. Do you want to add more color to that, Brad? Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The only thing I would add is it gets back to what we're talking about before. We would expect sitting here today, not as much restructuring spend, that's part of that answer, and the carryover benefits, obviously, are quite significant going into next year at $50 million. So, that gives us some jumpstart into that discussion of margin expansion into 2016. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : And on top of that, we are anticipating and planning and identifying significant benefits from productivity in 2016. Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Wright of Nomura Securities. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning, guys. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Bob, just digging into your comments on China a little bit. Was that 15% number in 3Q for Dover as a whole? And maybe if you could just dig into the verticals a little bit and talk about which pockets were weakest and how that's trended into 4Q. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. It was Dover \u2013 it was a Dover number. And, gosh, Jonathan, I'm going to have to \u2013 I'd be guessing because I don't have good recall on what the down cycle was in China by each segment. It was evident at each segment, that I can tell you. But I don't have the numbers and a good recall for each segment. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: But where is the biggest exposure to China in the portfolio? Is it Printing & ID? Or where is your biggest exposure? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Fluids and Printing & ID. And it's not \u2013 it's actually not insignificant for Refrigeration either. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. And then just one more. The comments you made around kind of the international tax planning benefit from the restructuring you've conducted, does that imply a lower tax rate in 2016 or is that sort of a one-off benefit you're seeing this year? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : I think \u2013 I would characterize it more like a one-off for this year, and probably reverting back to that slightly below 30% rate, at 29% rate for 2016. Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Good morning, Bob, Brad or Paul. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Paul E. Goldberg - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey, Nathan. Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Just starting with the JK acquisition, I know the knock on a lot of the competitors in that space has been that they don't control the ink. With you now controlling the ink there, is that something you can use as a strategic weapon or a strategic advantage in competing in that space? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Well, I don't like the word weapon because \u2013 we'll use it as a strategic opportunity to better service our customers. Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So the answer is yes. I'll take that as... Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely, yeah. Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Then my second question is on the cost actions that you've taken so far this year. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : I will underscore how important that question is on this JK acquisition. Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. I think that answers it. So on the cost out actions that you've taken this year, one of your comments in your prepared remarks, Bob, was that you've permanently reduced the cost structure. Could you give us some flavor for what is structural reduction in cost and what is volume related? Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : Oh, my goodness. So, let's see. How do I want to tackle that one, Brad? Let's \u2013 help me with the response here between manufacturing cost and SG&A. Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : So for manufacturing cost, our restructuring activity, I think we're at a run rate now, an annualized run rate of $90 million or $94 million, is \u2013 am I right with that number? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : $92 million across all segments, yeah. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : And a significant chunk of that was not recognized for the entire year. We have about $45 million of that, that is a carryover into 2016. And then below the line, below the gross margin line, we have taken out \u2013 goodness, is it close to $50 million in SG&A? Brad M. Cerepak - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : $35 million. Robert A. Livingston - President and Chief Executive Officer : $35 million in SG&A, of which we would label about 18% to 20% of that as permanent. And it's that permanent part of SG&A that I add to the carryover from the manufacturing cost of about $40 million that gets me to the round number of about $50 million of benefits that we'll see in 2016 as we see these projects complete the annual cycle. Nathan Jones - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period.

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our fourth quarter and full year results continue to be impacted by tough market conditions especially in oil and gas. We delivered fourth quarter adjusted EPS $0.81 in this driven by solid execution and some year-end tax benefits as our teams continued to pursue customer wins, cost actions and productivity initiatives. In 2015, we increased our efforts around operating efficiencies through our Dover Excellence program. One key element of this program focuses on free cash flow generation which increased to 795 million for the year. The program also supports our ongoing investment and product innovation and customer activities. Additionally during the year we took multiple steps to resize our businesses to reflect difficult market conditions, especially in our Energy segment. These initiatives will remain of focus in 2016. Further we closed on four acquisitions since our last call. These businesses would generate well over $0.5 billion in revenue 2016 and significantly complement and expand our market positions. Now, let me share some comments on the quarter. From a geographic perspective, excluding our energy exposure in tough comps and retail refrigeration markets, our U.S. industrial activity remained solid and grew more than 4% year-over-year. On a sequential basis China markets improved and European activity was largely flat. Both regions were down versus the prior year. In Energy markets were even tougher as we moved through the quarter and into the New Year. Given that as a backdrop our teams focused on actions to drive sales and remained resolute in implementing cost reductions. Our aggressive cost actions have reduced the impact of volume declines as reflected by decremental margins in the low 30s. On the revenue side, we estimate we\u2019ve generated 5% growth from new business, much of it driven by new product introductions and continuing strong service levels. In 2016, we will strategically look to win new business with a strong focus on customer service and of course continue to look for opportunities to reduce our cost structure. Engineered Systems had a solid quarter with 4% organic growth. Within Printing & Identification, our digital textile printing results were strong, driven by a significant increase in order activity. We also posted good results in our core marking and coding business. In the industrial platform modest organic growth was led by strong results in our environmental solutions business. Fluids once again posted strong margin, despite revenue being impacted by oil and gas exposure, reduced year-end capital spending and tough comps offer a very strong fourth quarter of last year. The solid execution resulted in segment margin exceeding 19%, excluding the impact of recently completed acquisitions. Within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment, revenue and earnings performance was as expected. Importantly, we now see the benefits of our customer expansion efforts reflected by new wins in retail refrigeration. Our retail refrigeration orders were up 20% over last year, setting us up for an improved start in 2016. As we\u2019ve discussed, we were able to close as we ended the year. Integration activities are well under way and our customers are excited about the broader product sets we now offer. Early results are quite positive. Regarding the acquisition pipeline, we\u2019ve continued to look for businesses that expand and enhance our positions in our key markets and will remain diligent and disciplined on valuations. Now looking to 2016, we expect Engineered Systems, Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment to all grow revenue this year. Within Energy we\u2019ve remained cautious. We have reduced our full year revenue forecast to reflect weaker U.S. market conditions providing some offset we now have better line up side on incremental new business. Our aggressive pursue of additional business expanding our international presence and strong focus on cost is ongoing. We expect to make further progress on these initiatives in 2016. In Engineered Systems, we anticipate solid organic growth led by the leading technology and new products offered across the segment. Specifically, we expect the marking and coding markets to be solid and our digital textile businesses to have double digit growth. Within our industrial platform, modest organic growth will be led by strong performance in environmental solutions and vehicle services. This performance will be complemented by our continued focus on cost and productivity. Fluids will grow driven by the recent acquisitions. We also anticipate continued strong core margin performance on the benefits of ongoing productivity projects. In addition, a well-executed integration of our recent acquisitions will provide a path to future revenue and margin improvement and enhanced customer service through skill and efficiencies. Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment we expect much improved revenue and earnings in 2016, leveraging our leading technology and merchandizing solutions. Retail refrigeration should lead the improvement. We also expect solid performance in our Food Equipment markets. In summary, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance. With that let me turn it over to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks Bob. Good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today we\u2019ve reported fourth quarter revenue of 1.7 billion, a decrease of 14%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 12%, growth from acquisitions of 2% and an FX impact of 4%. Adjusted EPS was $0.81and above our implied Q4 forecast. The performance improvement consists of $0.01 higher segment income and $0.05 on the tax line. Segment margin for the quarter was 13.3%, 150 basis points below last year. Adjusting for fourth quarter restructuring of 16.5 million, margin was 14.3%. Restructuring activities were broad based with a continued focus on Energy. Bookings decreased 13% to 1.6 billion, largely reflecting significantly lower oil and gas markets and soft macro conditions. Overall book-to-bill finished at 0.96. Our backlog decreased 16% to 1 billion. Free cash flow was once again solid at 274 million for the quarter 16% of revenue. We are beginning to see the results of our Dover Excellence program reflected in cash flow performance. For the full year we generated 795 million of free cash flow, representing over 11% of revenue, a full point higher than last year. Now turning to Slide 4, Engineered Systems had solid organic growth of 4%, reflecting strong growth in our Printing & Identification and environmental solutions markets. Fluids decline of 6% was driven by weak oil and gas markets and generally softer market conditions. Refrigeration & Food Equipments organic revenue declined 6% primarily on reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Energy organic revenue was down 40% on significant declines in North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was 2% while FX had a negative 4% impact. Turning to Slide 5 and our sequential results, revenue decreased 5% from the third quarter, largely reflecting normal seasonality in our retail refrigeration markets and a continued step down in Energy markets. Engineered Systems and Fluids were modestly up. Sequential bookings decreased 5%, principally driven by the impact of oil and gas markets and normal seasonality in retail refrigeration. Strong growth in Engineered Systems resulted from solid Printing & Identification markets and robust environmental solutions orders. Now on Slide 6, Energy revenue of 323 million decreased 41% driving earnings down to 31 million. Energy results continued to be impacted by steep declines in oil and gas markets. However, we continue to see targeted customer wins in the Middle East and North America. Energy absorbed an additional 4 million in restructuring cost in the fourth quarter and has incurred 31 million in cost for the full year. Excluding the Q4 restructuring cost, our operating margin was 10.8%, reflecting volume and price declines partially offset by the benefits of productivity and previously completed restructuring. We expect the carry over benefits of these and other cost actions to be approximately 40 million in 2016. Booking through 316 million in book-to-bill was 0.98. Now on Slide 7, Engineered Systems revenue of 597 million increased 1% overall, reflecting organic growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 3%, partially offset by an FX impact of 6%. Earnings of 89 million decreased 4%, principally reflecting the impact of acquisitions in the quarter. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue was 256 million, increasing 3%. Organic revenue was up 8%, reflecting strong digital textile markets and solid North American marking and coding activity. Acquisitions had 6% growth while FX had 11% impact. In the industrial platform, overall revenue declined1% to 342 million, where organic growth of 1% was offset by FX of 2%. Organic growth was once again led by environmental solutions. We incurred 5 million in restructuring cost in the quarter for actions that will further improve our cost structure. Excluding the Q4 restructuring cost, margins were 15.7%, reflecting the benefits of prior cost actions partially offset by business mix. Bookings were 608 million, a decrease of 2%, reflecting organic bookings growth of 1% and acquisition growth of 2%, offset by 5% impact from FX. Organically Printing & Identification bookings were up 6% and industrial bookings decreased 3%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 0.98, while industrials was 1.05, overall book-to-bill was 1.02. Turning to Slide 8, Fluids revenue decreased 6% to 356 million and earnings decreased 1% to 62 million. Revenue performance reflects 6% decline in organic revenue, whereby the impact of acquisitions and FX largely offset each other. Our Fluids transfer businesses remained solid and were up slightly organically. While our pumps results reflect the impact of weak oil and gas markets and the timing of large project shipments. The impact of acquisitions reduced margins roughly 170 basis points in the quarter resulting in margin of 17.6%. Excluding acquisitions and related purchase having a deal cost, margin was 19.3% reflecting continued strong execution. Bookings were 321 million, a decrease of 7% overall or 6% organically. This result primarily reflects slower year-end CapEx activity and the impact of oil and gas exposure in our pumps markets. Book-to-bill was 0.90. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9, Refrigeration and Food Equipments revenue of 419 million declined 9% from the prior year and earnings were 43 million. As expected, revenue continued to be impacted by reduced volume from a key retail refrigeration customer. Our glass door business remained solid and our can-shaping business was improved. Operating margin was 10.2%, adjusting for 6 million in restructuring cost for the quarter margin was 11.7%, down 50 basis points from ingested prior year reflecting lower volume, partially offset by productivity improvements. Bookings were 380 million, an increase of 3%, reflecting significant improvements in order activity. Book-to-bill was 0.91, a large improvement over last year. This strong bookings activity sets us up well as we begin 2016. Now going to the overview Slide number 10, let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was 25 million, down 5 million, reflecting ongoing cost management initiatives. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 25%, excluding discreet tax benefits. This rate was lower than our last estimate principally reflecting passage of the Tax Relief Extension Act, as of now [ph] our full year normalized tax rate was 27.8%. Moving on to Slide 11, which shows our full year guidance. Our 2016 revenue guidance has been modestly lowered from our recent Investor Day. We now expect revenue to increase 1% to 4%, within this estimate organic revenue is expected to be down in the range of 1% to 4%, one point reduction from our prior forecast due to oil and gas markets. We expect completed acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, while the impact of FX is expected to be about 2%. This is unchanged from our prior guidance. As a reminder, at the mid-point of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 16.5% excluding the impact of recent acquisitions. Our full year corporate expense and interest expense forecast remains unchanged. We now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 28%, one point lower than our last guide, reflecting the Tax Relief Extension Act and the impact of recent acquisitions. CapEx remains unchanged as does our full year free cash flow forecast. From a segment perspective, Energy\u2019s full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 11% to 14%, a three point reduction from our prior forecast. The expected full impact from declines in oil and gas markets is partially offset by incremental new business not in our prior forecast. All other segments were unchanged versus our prior guidance. Turning to 2016 bridge now on Slide 12, let\u2019s start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.55 around $0.07 higher than forecasted at our Investor Day, reflecting slightly better Q4 performance and an improved tax rate. We expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to provide $0.15 to $0.17 benefit. Performance including changes in volume, productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits will add $0.26 to $0.40 to earnings, modestly lower than our previous forecast. Within this estimate our restructuring benefits of $023 to $0.24. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.26 to $0.28. Acquisitions already completely including Toucan will be about $0.18 accretive. The carry over benefit of shares already purchased will be approximately $0.08. Interest, corporate and the tax rate will impact earnings about $0.08, reflecting a minor improvement over our last forecast. In total we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.85 to $4.05. This estimate is unchanged from our prior forecast. With that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts. Robert Livingston : Thanks Brad. Markets are mixed as we enter 2016. Our businesses with exposure to oil and gas will once again face challenges, whereas Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment should grow organically. Within this environment we will remain focused on new product launches and innovation across the entire organization, expanding our business with new customers and in new geographies, capitalizing on our customer wins mindset by becoming an even more important partner with our customers and leveraging our Dover Excellence program to continue to drive margin, productivity and cash flow. The combination of these actions is expected to provide incremental revenue of 2 points in 2016 and increase core margin 20 to 40 basis points. The bulk of this incremental revenue is sales from new product introductions. Our plan for EPS growth and strong free cash flow in 2016 is supported by three significant activities that have already been implemented. They are the completion of several acquisitions that will deliver meaningful accretion. 2015 restructuring actions that will provide significant benefits this year and completed share repurchase activity that will deliver $0.08. We expect oil and gas markets to remain uncertain in 2016 and we are poised to take further cost actions beyond what is currently forecasted if necessary. With that I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. Paul, let\u2019s take some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks, before we take questions I\u2019d just like to remind you, if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow up. We have several people in queue, so the more questions we have the less people we can talk to. With that Kristine, let\u2019s have the first question. Operator : Our first question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Robert Livingston : Hey Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, Bob I was hoping you could expand on Energy where you said that there was some new business that you had won, maybe kind of expand there, what products, what regions? And you also mentioned international expansion. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Good morning, Bob. Robert Livingston : Sure, I\u2019d like to - look I think I have shared this comment on at least one call if not a couple of calls last year that as we work through this down cycle in the Energy business, we have continued to work on new product, new product launches and targeting specific customers that we thought we should an initial business position with or even a larger business position with. And in 2015, I think in the second half of the year, we estimated that we had about 5% of our revenue in the second half of Energy with relabeled as new wins. As we provided guidance and initial guidance at the December meeting, we knew we were going to keep the business that we had won in 2015, but we were not including in our guidance any anticipated new business in 2016 unless we actually had a contract or knew we had won the business. And since then we have won some business, we\u2019ve got contracts. Some of the business will actually have modest shipments on here in the first quarter and it\u2019s across the segment, specifically within the upstream markets, we continue to win new business with our PDC intro [ph], but it is most noticeable within our artificial lift business. But I would be remissive if I didn\u2019t throw or call that out [ph] to the guys and our Bearings & Compression business, they\u2019ve also been pretty active and have been successful in this endower as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks, good morning guys. Robert Livingston : Hi Joe. Joseph Ritchie : Just a quick question on oil and gas, there\u2019s a lot of outcomes and uncertainty as it relates to oil and gas over the next three years. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense on how you\u2019re thinking about [indiscernible] business is set up today if we go to cash cost or if we get an uptick in oil and gas and really just where is your mindset there today? Robert Livingston : Well, I guess to begin that answer Joe; I\u2019ll revert back to the answer I just provide Deane. We have been very active in taking cost out in 2015 and you\u2019ll see us continue to do that in 2016. But at some point in time we will see a change in this market and we are still convinced that our superior - what we believe are our superior service levels and the continuing investment we\u2019re making in product development are the right things to do to be prepared for an upturn when that occurs. Our assumptions in 2016 guide, we are seeing our plan in the first quarter, maybe even in the first four months of year reflect the current pricing of oil in today\u2019s environment, let\u2019s call it roughly $30. Our plan does assume that the price recovers a bit in the second half of the year. Our plan is based on $40 oil price in the second half of the year. Joseph Ritchie : That\u2019s helpful Bob and maybe my one follow up is really around margins and Brad perhaps for you, within the 16.5 guidance for total portfolio what is the Energy number and how do you think about them the trajectory of Energy margins if and when do you get an uptick in oil. Brad Cerepak : Okay, sure, so the 16.5 at the midpoint, that\u2019s an adjusted number, just to reiterate that. That\u2019s excluding acquisition related activity but with respect to our segment, the core margin expansion is really coming from the other three segments. We see Energy year-over-year adjusted to adjust down into 2016 and I would say roughly, we would say the margin expectation in Energy is around 12% to 13% for 2016. I would say the way we see the year on Energy, reiterating what Bob said is that obviously year-over-year in the first quarter energy is going to be down significantly. I would say we should be thinking about energy more like the fourth quarter moving into the first quarter, sequentially being pretty much the same and as it relates to the rest of the year than as we see in our forecast some recovery in the average price per barrel of oil, is modest. We would see some further improvement throughout the year. As it relates to the other segments, year over year core margin expansions so the first quarter and into the year will look a lot like the sequence what we have seen in 2015, that is the way we think about it. Joseph Ritchie : Great, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Good morning, guys. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question on pretty good industrial performance Printing and ID could you get us some color because it seems you guys did quite a bit better than Danaher reported this morning. Brad Cerepak : Well, we had - as I reported we had a very strong fourth-quarter at Markem-Imaje organic growth for Markem-Imaje in the quarter was 4%. We actually ended up for the entire second half at 4%, we ended up at 5% organic for the full-year, but on top of that we had a very strong performance from MS, our textile printing business. And interestingly enough we didn\u2019t get any contribution for our higher margin accusation JK in the fourth quarter because of our AD&A charges, but we were quite pleased with the performance of the printing and ID platform in the fourth quarter. I would add to that North America was strong for us in the fourth quarter. Andrew Obin : And could you just point to specific areas of strength that you were seeing as I said because I think the buy side and sell side are still gloomy in North American industrial and you guys are doing so well. Brad Cerepak : Well, if you look at the three regions North America, Europe and Asia, I\u2019m doing this little bit from memory here, but I think North America was our strongest business and for Markem-Imaje in the fourth quarter perhaps followed by Europe and trailed by Asia. Andrew Obin : And if I may on other industrial business what trends are you seeing, are you seeing any destocking towards the end of the quarter, once again very strong performance. Brad Cerepak : No, actually we were quite pleased with the performance from Engineered Systems in the quarter both platforms, both printing and ID as well as our industrial platform and did not see any evidence at all of destocking. Andrew Obin : Well congratulations, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you, good morning Jim [ph]. Robert Livingston : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Hey, good morning, just before my question, one point of clarification, about what Brad said about Energy in Q1 are the comment about similar to Q4 was that similar rate of year-over-year decline organically or similar revenue levels versus Q4. Robert Livingston : No, actually I would tell you that if you look at the first quarter for Dover, if you go back and look at the first quarter of last year and the results will be quite similar and the other three segments excluding Energy, the real change you are going to change in the - yeah, in aggregate, the real change you are going to see in the first quarter is simply the year-over-year decline in Energy. Jeff as you remember the first quarter of last year was still a pretty strong quarter, I would love to return to that level this year, but the first quarter for Energy last year was pretty strong and almost all of the first quarter of \u201816 down from first quarter of \u201815 is attributable to the decline in energy. Jeff Sprague : Right I was trying to get at whether or not regarding with an organic\u2026 Robert Livingston : On revenue actually, okay if you want to look at it sequentially I think our revenue guide for energy is probably down very, very slightly, maybe $10 million sequentially from the fourth quarter. Jeff Sprague : Okay, thank you. Robert Livingston : Our earnings are flat in Energy fourth quarter to first. Jeff Sprague : That\u2019s very helpful. Hey can you just talk about the Fluids for a moment, book to bill it is a little bit disconcerting, you mentioned timing, but is the timing around oil and gas related jobs that maybe could continue to be a timing issue if you get my interest and just \u2026 Robert Livingston : Yeah, actually that was probably one area in Fluids that what was a bit of a concern in the fourth quarter, Jeff, the - we do continue to see the impact of our oil and gas exposure, especially in our pumps business and I am refereeing to the upstream oil and gas activity and that was down a little bit more than we had anticipated in the fourth quarter. We see that continuing in \u201816, in fact, I would tell you we have been overall I believe sitting here today we are being cautious with respect to fluids and our guide for 2016 because of that, it is just much more difficult to forecast accurately our activity through our distributors and the upstream oil and gas market and some of the other I call them second-order connect markets then it is with actively direct with OEMs. But on top of that, we did see an absence where I would call normal CapEx spending that you see in the fourth quarter, what I called year-end capital budget flush outs and there was a little bit different profile in the fourth quarter and I think we\u2019re being appropriately cautious with our Fluids guide for 2016. Jeff Sprague : Okay, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Thanks, good morning guys. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Nigel Nigel Coe : Just wanted to go back to I think the comment that\u2019s you made on regarding Energy the sequential but looks at the last year I think that was the comment and I am just wondering does that includes Tokheim because that is up the - is very material acquisition. Robert Livingston : No, I\u2019m really referring to earnings Nigel not the top line, obviously in the first quarter we will have the top line performance from Tokheim, but I don\u2019t have the detector but I don\u2019t think we are expecting any contribution or earnings from Tokheim in the first quarter just because we have the normal, well I call it front end of purchase accounting on the Tokheim acquisition. Also don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that as we enter 2016, we don\u2019t drop it to disc ops because that rule was changed but we try to show this details to you on the attached slides that we didn\u2019t disclose a significant business, a $100 million business walk-in covers in the fourth quarter obviously that is not in the numbers in 2016 and we have another pending divestiture that should close here so in the next few weeks that is about a hundred million dollar a year in revenue that is not an guide. Nigel Coe : Okay, that is helpful Bob. I\u2019m just taking a step back and I guess this repeat into the portfolio, the discussion you just made. How do you think about capital allocation here this year because it seems like it\u2019s a good - better environment to be a buyer yet obviously the macro situations are little bit less visible, so is there a bias towards spending more or maybe conserving capital here, how do you think about that Bob? Robert Livingston : Well, I always start first with the comment that my preference is to build the business and through capital allocation and will make the acquisitions that are right to help us build bigger businesses and better businesses within Dover. And my second comment is guess we don\u2019t always control the timing of the opportunities. In fact if I remind people here it is rare for us to control the time and we get to say yes or no. I am a little cautious right now with respect to valuations because I think the sort of the down draft on public company valuations is not very well reflected in the - I would call it in private companies that maybe for sale. So we are being a bit cautious here with our outlook here over the next three or four months and then of course that brings up the question of share repurchases. And look, all I can tell you is look at our history we have been quite balanced between M&A and share repurchases over the last three or four years. You should expect us to be as discipline and balance over the next two or three as we have been over the last two or three, but we\u2019re not announcing a share repurchase activity today perhaps more on that over the next two or three months. Nigel Coe : Okay, very clear, thanks, Bob. Operator : Again, ladies and gentlemen please limit yourself to one question and one to follow up. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Hi, thank you. Robert Livingston : Good morning Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning, just a question on Refrigeration and Food Equipment, adjusted sales were down 7% in Q4, but your bookings in Hillphoenix were very good. So, when you\u2019re thinking about the sale\u2026 Robert Livingston : Thank you, I thought they were as well. Julian Mitchell : Right, when you\u2019re thinking about the sales base turning around, you are guiding up to 2 to 4 adjusted sales growth for 2016. Do we see those bookings speed into the revenues early in the year in Q1 or that is more of a second half feedings into revenue? Robert Livingston : Well, no you will see the bulk of those bookings have the revenue impact in Q1 but not all. I mean we do have a different order profile with some of our customers than we did with the Wal-Mart and I think we are well loaded with respect to - our factories are well loaded in their first quarter with respect to our forecast, but we are expecting to see this business and this segment return to a growth profile and in 2016 and we are pretty confident. I would add one further comment, last year we dealt with loss of significant chunk of business from Wal-Mart. We are not looking at Wal-Mart as the provider of our growth in 2016, in fact I think the guys are actually taking the Wal-Mart business down a little bit again in 2016, but with that we still believe we have got a good executable plan for growth within the Hillphoenix business and within the segment. Julian Mitchell : Thanks a lot and then my follow up would just be on the Energy segment. You talked about how you lowered your oil-price average assumption for the year, what about your assumption on pricing for your own products within that business of those - has that assumption change at all. Robert Livingston : No, we closed 2015 pretty dead on about 3% price concessions for the whole segment and I\u2019ve commented on the several times during 2015. The bulk of that we saw within our rods business and artificial lift and as well as our PVC insert business, with our drilling activity. We do include in our guide another 2% down on top of that is 2% incremental for the segment in 2016 and we feel pretty comfortable with that. Julian Mitchell : Great thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning. Robert Livingston : Good morning. Steven Winoker : Just a bit fire point to get on the Energy side what rate kind of assumption are you making in now for 2016 given this continued deterioration. Robert Livingston : So, let\u2019s say I told you that in the first three to four months of the year we are looking at a price of oil 30 or below 30s. For the recount I think low end of our guidance we see the rig count down 28% or 29%, at the high end point of our guidance it is down 25%, 26%. Steven Winoker : Okay, great that\u2019s helpful thanks. And then if you breakout both the Engineered Systems the industrial peace within that on the pump side the things that were actually down\u2026 Robert Livingston : Wait a minute pump is not an Engineered Systems. Steven Winoker : No, no, I know, I am talking about two different segments. So within the on the first on the industrial side of Engineered Systems the down 3% on the bookings front and the down 1% on revenue, obviously that is not environmental which is - what is getting hit in that place, in that segment? Robert Livingston : Well, I\u2019m not following your - I am not - you have asked me about the numbers but I will\u2026 Steven Winoker : You said environmental solutions was positive something negative Robert Livingston : More of it, what you need to recognize that included in the industrial platform is a business that we owned in 2015, that we still own today, that we are the process of divesting and it is about $100 million a year and that revenue for that businesses is taking out of our guidance in 2016 and I think you\u2019ll note that is probably the most significant decline. Steven Winoker : That is hitting organic, okay. Robert Livingston : That is hitting organic, yes. Steven Winoker : Okay fine and then I was just thinking on the pumps side within Fluids the non-energy side you got industrial plastics and [indiscernible] et cetera what do you think in those areas. Robert Livingston : Hold it solid. Steven Winoker : Okay great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Barclays. Scott Davis : Hi guys, and sorry if you already answered this question. I don\u2019t recall hearing you say what you\u2019re pricing your backlog look like holistically, was it that you said it was flattish, I think your sector Energy was better than kind of expected but the price for oil. Robert Livingston : The pricing in our backlog gosh, Scott we are such a book and ship business, it is not something I really pay much attention to as I commented earlier within Energy our price for the segment, our price concessions for the segment were down 3% for 2015 and we expect another 2% down in 2016 but I\u2019m not sure. Does that answer your question? Scott Davis : Yeah, I guess I was trying to get at the non-Energy stuff and see if there was some price deflation you\u2019re seeing on those businesses. Robert Livingston : No, no. Scott Davis : Okay that\u2019s fair enough and then what is the FX impact on the backlog, has to be pretty substantial I would think so trying to get some granularity there. Robert Livingston : I would say we dealt with the bulk of the FX impact on our backlog in the first nine months of last year. I don\u2019t think we have any exposure in our backlog beyond what we\u2019re already guiding, which is another 2% headwind this year in FX and I should be sitting here with a smile on my face saying it is down from four to two, but still 2% is a pretty significant number for us, but again it is - we are such a book and ship business that you see it sure pretty quickly in revenue and I think we\u2019ve got it covered. Scott Davis : Okay, all the other questions have been answered, so thank guys. Robert Livingston : All right, thanks, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Just a couple of questions on restructuring team can you just help us kind of reconcile, what would be the incremental restructuring did you guys took relative to the third quarter in Energy what was - I had my own expectation but kind of what was the steps up and down that was attributable to Energy from your third quarter guide? And then also of what were the year-over-year savings you guys recorded? I assume you\u2019re getting some of the savings where you took some heavy structuring early in the year, what was the savings that is recorded year-over-year in your Energy margin in the fourth quarter? Brad Cerepak : Oh my goodness, I don\u2019t have that detail with me the restructuring in the fourth quarter and energy was little over $4 million and I think that was - I think it was probably up $2 million slightly it was up about 2 million over what we thought we would do as we entered the quarter. Steve Tusa : So, I guess the question is if things are worse here going forward if it is not you guys are down more like in line of what you are down relative to rig count this year, I mean are you still taking kind of these only choosy restructurings or do we need to see more dramatic cost take out, because this seems like $2 million relative to your annual revenue rate and the decline to dramatic step down in rigs that we\u2019d had and the dramatic step down on oil price, is it a little bit late to help us feel good about the margins you\u2019re gearing (ph) for next year. Robert Livingston : I think if we - and it\u2019s a good question Steve, I\u2019d tell you that if we weren\u2019t continuing to try to expand our customer service activity and we did in \u201815 and our plan in \u201816 is again to actually see an increase in product development spending within Energy, if we weren\u2019t doing that you would see actually more benefits coming through from some of the restructuring actions we have taken in \u201815. In 2016, I think our guide we have; I think $20 million of restructuring charges in our guide for 2016, 80% of that\u2019s probably in the first half Steve, there may be a little bit of trickle over into the third quarter, but 80% of it, I would say is in the first half. Of the 20 million probably 9 million of it is Energy. The balance of the 11, a little bit Refrigeration, but the balance of the $11 million is pretty evenly split between Fluids and Engineered Systems and if we see further deterioration in the Energy market - look we have got a - at some point in time we have this push versus pull of taking cost out versus continuing to invest for tomorrow and for being a better partner with our customers. And if we see further deterioration in the energy market that debate gets a bit harsher. Steve Tusa : Got it, great, thanks a lot. Robert Livingston : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan: In terms of down 45 in drilling and production in the quarter, do you have the split between the drilling and the production piece and then are you seeing any change in sort of drill, but uncompleted well activity or any other dynamics there. Robert Livingston : So, do I have a split between drilling and production, you will have to follow up with Paul and I don\u2019t have that, I will tell you as a cover comment that through every single quarter in \u201816, our drilling activity was down year-over-year much more than our other upstream activity which is artificial lift and automation. I think our drilling activity in \u201816 was down 60% or 65%, significantly more than we saw in artificial lift and automation. I don\u2019t know, does that give you a little bit color, but I don\u2019t have the exact numbers Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan: Yeah, that\u2019s helpful and in terms of I mean now that we are down at 30, I mean have you seen any change in behavior on the production side in terms of these uncompleted wells or anything else in the various space. Robert Livingston : We are monitoring that pretty closely, we continue to see what is the industry, looks like [ph] ducts drilled uncompleted, we continue to see the ducts inventory built during the third and fourth quarter, that\u2019s always hard to forecast. For us it is something that we look at in our sort of our rear view mirror as the data gets released, but we do know that the activity is quite different between the basins here in North America. West Texas or the Permian basin is starting to see some increased completion of drilled, but previously uncompleted wells, we are not seeing that in the other basins and that\u2019s our fourth quarter comment that\u2019s not our first quarter comment. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, that makes sense, thanks a lot guys. Robert Livingston : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi Group. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Robert Livingston : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Bob, I think you mentioned that China sequentially improved in 4Q versus 3Q and I know you had some comments of that at the analyst dinner. Maybe you can talk about China across the business, are you seeing more signs of stability there across the business. Robert Livingston : You are referring to China, if the question is more of a general comment about China, I can\u2019t see the improvement we just don\u2019t see it, even when we talk to our folks on the ground there. I think the improvement we saw in the fourth quarter, I am going to trace it back to comments I have been making all year long it\u2019s - we continue to look for opportunities or new product releases, a new product specific to China market, even with some of the restructuring activity that we have planned in the first three to five months of 2016 and this is [indiscernible] comment within the Fluid segment all of that restructuring is in Europe, People interestingly enough and some of the benefits that we will achieve with the restructuring of China is actually being reallocated to increase our customer facing and service capabilities in China, there are opportunities for growth but I am not going to label, I am not going got label the change we saw in a n fourth quarter is a grounds well changed. Andy Kaplowitz : Okay, that\u2019s helpful and you talked about Refrigeration already, but the margin itself was relatively low, a lot of that has to do with lower volume, do you think this is the bottom for margin in that segment and do you see have you seen any incremental pricing pressure in that segment or do you expect it to improve. Robert Livingston : Oh gosh, this is probably the - let\u2019s not talk about the segment, it is specific, my comment would be very specific to Hillphoenix, I would say that this is always been a very price competitive market and we will see what happens in 2016 and 2017 where the change in ownership with our major competitor. Margins in the segment for the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter is historically, traditionally our weakest quarter of the year for margins for the segment. I think we saw that again in the fourth quarter of \u201815, but we do see a pretty good path going forward here in 2016 for margin improvement for the year. Andy Kaplowitz : Thank you. Robert Livingston : Do we have another question Kristine? Operator : Yes, our next question comes from Johnny Wright with Nomura. Johnny Wright : Good morning, guys. Robert Livingston : Good morning. Johnny Wright : So I think in Fluid, Bob you talked about of extreme exposure 10% - 12% gas, does wondering about mid-stream exposure given we have seen some started to come [indiscernible] kind of more pulling back on CapEx, do you have sense of how big mid-stream exposure there is particular in the [indiscernible] and hearing from customer. Robert Livingston : We have some exposure, I am not sure what the percentage is, I think it may be less than we have in upstream, we have we have seen it in some of our fuel transfer product that\u2019s deal with terminals and distribution I would say it was softer than expected in 2015 but I would label it as negative, we are taking cautious approach as we look at that part of the market in 2016 but I also point out that we also have this mid-stream exposure around Energy within our Energy segment in bearings and compression and we watch that pretty closely especially the OEM build rates around compressors and that was down in the second half of last year. We are not anticipating a recovery in fact I believe that the guys are actually see further decreases in OEM compressor build rates in 2016. Johnny Wright : Okay, all right guys, given that on the Fluid sides and giving where you are floor keepers and the sales and the book to bill front, what kind of offsetting positives that give you comfort in that negative 1% to plus 2% organic for 2016. Robert Livingston : Look, you asked a question about the mid-stream but still the bulk of our by a large percentage, the bulk of our activity and fluids is not in upstream or mid-stream, the retail filling piece which is fairly significant and even more so now with the acquisition of Tokheim we view as solid around the globe in 2016, it has both market expansion opportunities as well as some significant drivers and safety and regulatory issues. And we have embedded within that platform, within our fluid transfer platform is our medical and our connector business or fluid connector business and that business I think had 7% or 8% organic growth in 2015 and is looking at something similar to that in 2016. Johnny Wright : Great, thanks guys. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve reached our allotted time for Q&A today and we thank you for your participation in today\u2019s fourth quarter 2015 Dover Earnings call.

Robert Livingston : Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. As previously communicated, our first quarter was well below our initial expectations, driven by significant further reductions in activity and capital spending within our U.S. oil and gas related end markets. These conditions primarily impacted our energy segment and to a lesser extent fluid. The market served by engineered systems and refrigeration and food equipment remained solid, resulting in an organic growth of 3% in each segment. In total, we delivered first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.52 until further steps to reduce our cost and right-size our businesses. In addition to introducing new products and pursuing share gains, we are increasing the restructuring actions and have stepped up our efforts on productivity, including shared services. Now let me share some comments on the quarter. From a geographic perspective, excluding our energy segment, our U.S. industrial activity remained solid and grew organically low single-digits year-over-year. Both our China and European markets were down sequentially and also down organically from the prior year. In energy, markets further deteriorated as we moved through the quarter. Market activity levels hit new lows on continued declines in the U.S. rig count and reduced capital spending, which in turn drove our first quarter revenue and earnings down significantly. Our teams have remained resolute on actions to drive sales and share gains and in reducing all non-essential cost, while still maintaining their engineering talent and ability to respond to customer opportunities. Engineered systems organic growth was 3%. Within printing and identification, we once again posted solid results in our core marking and coding business. And the industrial platform, organic growth was broad based. Fluids posted strong revenue growth driven by the recent acquisitions of Tokheim, Geller [ph] and Reduction. On an organic basis, our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure and those businesses serving integrated energy customers, especially within retail fueling posted declines. Our Refrigeration and Food Equipment segment grew 3% organically, largely driven by retail refrigeration. Revenue in earnings performance was as expected, benefiting from our customer expansion efforts taken over the last several quarters. Regarding acquisitions, we believe we have line of sight on several deals over the next few quarters and our key growth markets. Now looking forward, within energy as a result of further U.S. market declines, we have reduced our organic revenue forecast, which is now expected to be down 27% to 30% for the full year. On a sequential basis, the first quarter was down 12%. We now expect the second quarter to sequentially decline another 10%. In Engineered Systems, our expectations for organic growth are unchanged, driven by the leading technology and new products offered across the segment. We expect the marking and coding business to grow low to mid-single-digits and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. Within our industrial platform, we expect modest broad based growth. Fluids will grow this year, driven by their recent acquisitions, which should generate roughly 400 million in revenue in 2016. We also expect solid to strong growth from our industrial hygienic and pharma markets. Overall organic revenue is expected to be a few points lower than previously forecasted, as a result of direct oil and gas exposure, lower CapEx spending for integrated energy customers and project timing. Finally, within Refrigeration and Food Equipment, our plans for organic revenue growth and margin improvement remain on track, heading into the seasonally strong second and third quarters. Our leading technology and merchandising solutions are resulting in customer wins at several regional and national food retail chains. In summary, we are lowering our full year EPS guidance to reflect the impact of oil and gas markets. Our full year guidance includes 40 million of restructuring costs, which will deliver significant benefits on an annualized basis. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Brad for further comments. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on slide three of the presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.6 billion, a decrease of 5%. This result was comprised of an organic revenue decline of 7%, and an FX impact of 1%. Growth from acquisitions of 6% less dispositions resulted in net acquisition growth of 3%. EPS was $0.64; it includes $0.05 of discrete tax benefit and a $0.07 gain from a disposition. Segment margin for the quarter was 11.7%, a 180 basis points below last year. Adjusting for first quarter restructuring of approximately $14 million, margin was 12.5%. Restructuring activities were primarily focused within our Energy and Fluid segment. Bookings decreased 4% over the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result acquisition growth of 4% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas market disposition and FX. Organic bookings in our Engineered System and Refrigeration and Food Equipment segments grew 4% and 5% respectively. Overall, book-to-bill finished at 1.03, up slightly from last year. Our backlog decreased 10%; to $1.1 billion and was down 6% excluding disposition. Free cash flow was $96 million, or 6% of revenue consistent with the prior year first quarter. We expect to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the full year. Now let's turn to slide four. Engineered Systems and Refrigeration and Food Equipment both increased organic revenue 3%. This increase reflects broad based growth of Engineered Systems and in retail refrigeration and can-shaping businesses of Refrigeration and Food Equipment. Fluids organic decline of 3% was driven by oil and gas markets and lower CapEx spending in select fluid transfer markets. Energy organic revenue was down 33% on further decline in the North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, net acquisition growth was most prevalent as fluid with 22% growth, principally driven by Tokheim. Now on slide five. Energy revenue of $283 million decreased 34%, driving earnings down from the prior year to $11 million. Energy's results continued to be further impacted by declines in oil and gas markets fundamentals especially the U.S. rig count. Energy incurred an additional $6 million in restructuring costs. Since the beginning of the oil and gas downturn in 2014, this segment has reduced their workforce by 32%, or 2,100 people. Excluding the Q1 restructuring costs, our operating margin was 6%, reflecting volume and price decline. We expect to complete additional cost actions in the second quarter and exit 2016 at around 10% margin. Bookings were $273 million and book-to-bill was 0.97. Turning to slide six. Engineered Systems revenue of $577 million increased 1% overall, reflecting organic revenue growth of 3% and unfavorable FX of 2%, net acquisitions were neutral, where the acquisition growth of JK was essentially offset by the revenue connected with the sale of the business. Earnings of $94 million increased 6%, principally reflecting the benefits of productivity and organic volume leverage. Of note, $11 million gain on the disposition was principally offset by increased cost associated with a factory - of recent factory consolidation and other one-time items. Our printing and identification platform revenue of $240 million, increased 4%. Organic revenue was up 1%, primarily reflecting solid North American marking and coding market. Acquisitions at 8% growth, while FX was 5% negative. In the industrial platform overall revenue decline 2% to $337 million, where organic growth of 4% was offset by a 5% impact from a disposition and a 1% from FX. Organic growth was broad based. We incurred $2 million in restructuring costs at the quarter. Excluding the Q1 restructuring costs, margin was 16.6%. Bookings of $573 million was flat, reflecting organic bookings growth of 4% and acquisition growth of 3%. Largely offset by the impact of a disposition in FX. Organically printing and identification bookings were essentially flat and industrial bookings increased 6%. Book-to-bill for printing and identification was 1.01, while industrial was 0.98. Overall, book-to-bill was 0.99. Now on slide seven, within fluids revenue increased 17% to $399 million. While earnings decreased 16% to $46 million. Revenue performance reflects 22% growth from acquisitions partially offset by a 3% decline in organic revenue and 2% from FX. Our fluids transfer and pumps results reflecting impact of weak oil and gas markets, reduced capital spending and the timing of orders, partially offset by solid results in industrial hygienic and pharma markets. Lower organic volume, the impact of acquisitions and 3 million of incremental restructuring costs reduced margin 460 basis points in the quarter. Excluding restructuring and acquisition and related purchase accounting, margin was 17.5%, an increase of 70 basis points over an adjusted prior year. Bookings were $418 million, an increase of 23%. This result primarily reflects the positive impact of acquisitions. On an inorganic basis, bookings were flat. Book-to-bill was 1.05. Now let's turn to slide eight, Refrigeration and Food Equipment\u2019s revenue was $363 million declined 2% from the prior year, and earnings with $38 million, an increase of 6%. Organic revenue growth of 3% was largely driven by wins at several retail refrigeration customers. We also had solid results in our glass door and can-shaping equipment businesses. Overall, the disposition of our walk-in cooler product line in FX impacted revenue 5% and 1% respectively. Operating margin was 10.5% and 80 basis point increase over last year. This improvement was largely driven by the benefits of productivity and leverage on organic growth. Bookings of $411 million were down 2%. This result reflects 5% organic growth offset by a 6% impact of a disposition and 1% from FX. Book-to-bill was 1.13, reflecting normal seasonality in the retail refrigeration market. Going to the overview on slide nine, let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $30 million and net interest expense was $32 million, both in line with our prior forecast. Our first quarter tax rate was 27.9% excluding this pretax benefit. Now moving to slide 10, which shows our full year guidance. As Bob mentioned, our 2016 revenue guidance has been lower to reflect the oil and gas markets. We now expect total revenue to decrease 2% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 5% to 8% a 4-point reduction from our prior forecast. We expect net acquisitions will add approximately 4% growth unchanged from our prior guidance. We now expect the impact of FX to be about 1% negative for the year. At the midpoint of our guidance adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 15%. Excluding restructuring costs and further adjusting for acquisition and purchase accounting, margin is expected to be around 16%. Our full year forecast for corporate expense, interest expense and the pre-discrete tax rate remains unchanged. Additionally, CapEx remains unchanged as does our full year free cash flow forecast. From a segment perspective, energy full year organic revenue forecast is now expected to decline 27% to 30%. We have also reduced fluids organic revenue forecast, which now expected to decline 2% to 5%. Engineered Systems and Refrigeration and Food Equipment is unchanged versus our prior guidance, net acquisitions remained at 4% growth. Turning to the bridge on slide 11. Let's start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We now expect the year-over-year impact of restructuring cost to provide a $0.07 benefit, reflecting total 2016 restructuring cost of $40 million versus $55 million last year. Our revised forecast reflects $20 million or $0.09 EPS in incremental restructuring costs versus the prior forecast. Performance including changes in volume productivity, pricing and restructuring benefits will impact earnings $0.09 to $0.17. This is reduced from our previous forecast principally driven by the effect of lower volume. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.19 to $0.22, reflecting roughly $0.07 of reduced spend. Acquisitions plus dispositions will be $0.16 to $0.17 accretive in total. This amount includes the operating earnings of acquisition plus dispositions and the related gain. The carryover benefit of prior year's share repurchases, the impact of interest corporate expense and the tax rate are all unchanged. Lastly, as I mentioned before, we had a discrete tax benefit of $0.05 in the quarter. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.51 to $3.66, down about $0.50 at the midpoint of our prior guidance excluding the gain on a disposition and discrete tax benefits. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts. Robert Livingston : Thanks, Brad. As we begin the second quarter, markets remain mixed. Businesses with exposure to oil and gas continue to be impacted by historically weak markets. Engineered Systems is benefiting from solid industrial end markets, healthy printing and coding end markets and a continued growth in adoptions of digital printing and global textile activity. Refrigeration and Food Equipment is also quite resilient due in part to their leading retail refrigeration technologies that helps our customers capitalize on the growing trend of selling prepared and fresh food. Within fluids, although it's early, we are very excited about the customer response to our recent acquisitions. Within retail fueling customers are now asking us to provide our full scope of products. We are also seeing revenue synergies at our plastics and polymer customers with the addition of gain [ph] and reduction. We will continue to execute on initiatives to help drive growth and fund investments, namely, launching new products across the entire organization, expanding our business with new customers and new geographies, leveraging or Dover excellence program to continue to drive margin productivity and cash flow. And capitalizing on a scale for the establishment of shared service centers. In all, leveraging these growth opportunities and executing on our internal actions will help to mitigate mixed markets, drive productivity and redirect resources to pursue growth initiatives. We also expect to fully leverage the recovery in our oil and gas markets, when it comes. With that, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. And Paul, let\u2019s take some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks, Bob. Before we turn it back to Kristy, I just again like to remind you, if you can limit yourself to one question with one follow-up, that would be helpful. We have about 20 people in the question queue. So with that, Kristy, if you can give us our first question. Operator : Thank you. Your first question is coming from Steve Winoker of Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Thanks, and good morning, guys. Robert Livingston : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Steven Winoker : Could you maybe just start talking about the pacing of the energy revenue, as we move through the year, given the order dynamics, how long it takes to work through and the energy margin progression as well? Brad Cerepak : Okay, we\u2019ll see, Steve I think in my script I commented on our sequential decline in the first quarter of 12% and that we are anticipating another sequential decline in the second quarter of about 10%. You look at the second half, the second half revenue is closely aligned with what we view as the run rate for the second quarter, and I would add one color comment on that. In the second half, we do have about 45 million of share gain revenue, sort of split evenly between the third and fourth quarter on wins that we\u2019ve won and we have one at slide two, absent the share gain wins, the revenue in the second half would be modestly below the second quarter run rate. On margins for the year, margins are going to - I think, at the top end of our guide, margins are about 6% or 6.5%, all in, including restructuring. The restructuring activity is very heavily loaded in the first and second quarter. Second half sees the benefits from the restructuring activity and the absence of any new restructuring actions. And we do, our guide does show that we exit 2016 with an operating margin at energy, just about 10%. Steven Winoker : Okay. And just to follow that up then, if conditions were not to get any worse at this point, Bob and Brad, at what point do you see - could you actually see the comps easing enough into next year that you\u2019d actually be able to crossover in a positive territory? Robert Livingston : Activity, if we were at the trough now and activity didn\u2019t get any worst, but also assume that it doesn\u2019t get any better than you could see the first quarter of 2017 having a revenue run rate slightly above first quarter 2016. Steven Winoker : Okay. All right and while let me leave it there, given the number of questions. Thanks, guys. Brad Cerepak : All right. Thanks, Steve. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning. Thank you, guys. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Morning. I was wondering if you could address price in oil and gas, and also in fluids, it does look like you\u2019re expecting pretty good drop through on your restructuring actions, just kind of look at the footnotes of your bridge here, what are you anticipating for price erosion in that guide and in that payback? Brad Cerepak : Okay. So your question specific to energy and then the follow-up was fluids? Jeffrey Sprague : Yeah, I think I'm not sure you've got price pressure elsewhere, but I think that was the point. Brad Cerepak : I would - for first quarter in energy, price was a negative 1% for the segment. Jeff, I would still tell you that in our guide, we still have a negative 2% to 3% price pressure for the year, but in the first quarter, it was 1%. The price pressure in fluids for the year is less than 1% or I'm going to say about 1%, I think it\u2019s actually 0.9 to be specific. And then for the company as a whole, it's actually very, very slightly positive for the year. Jeffrey Sprague : That is a shockingly okay price down the number. Brad Cerepak : It's not that much different than what we experienced last year. Jeffrey Sprague : Yeah. So, people are behaving despite the volume decline on price. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Robert Livingston : Again, I would tell you that I gave you a number on energy segment and I would repeat myself what I said last year several times. You will get an individual product lines, you are going to see different stories. We still continue to see price pressure in our rods business that's very similar to what we saw last year, in fact last year I think price down on the rods business last year I think it was 9% or 10%, that's not going to be as bad this year. But we're still going to see price pressure on the rod business this year. And then our diamond insert business, I think for last year, Brad help me here 5%, 4% or 5%, 6% last year and we are expecting another price down in our insert business this year of 3% to 5%. Jeffrey Sprague : So, you've got positive price elsewhere in energy, where we got the - Robert Livingston : Bearings and compression. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. And then just a quick one to shift gears. How quickly do you think you can ramp up Tokheim's exposure in the U.S. and where you're at on sourcing OPW through Tokheim and some of that vertical integration we are looking at. Robert Livingston : The first question about Tokheim in the U.S., I'm going to differ a story on that until we get together at our Technology Day and what was it Paul, early or mid-June? We're still early days on the integration, the onboarding of this business and I think we'll have a better answer for you in June that I could give you today. But the integration of OPW and especially on the retail components business, the integration of OPW in Tokheim is moving along smoothly and the pull-through of OPW, I call it especially the hanging hardware is progressing as we expected. It's pretty positive. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Robert Livingston : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. My first question is just on the fluids guidance for the year on the revenue line. You talked in the presentation about the split between sort of solid industrial hygienic and pharma versus the oil and gas and energy stuff. In your full year organic guide now what do you - how do you split out the assumed revenue delta for each of those buckets in terms of oil and gas price - Robert Livingston : I don't have that detail in front of me, Julian. But to give you a little bit of color, I did use the descriptive phrase solid to strong when I described industrial and hygienic and pharma. I would tell you that in the industrial part of the portfolio mid-single digit pipe of growth and the pharma and the hygienic more so in the pharma, it's - we're seeing double-digit growth in those verticals. And it's been both of those verticals have been areas we've focused on building our product portfolio over the last couple of years. But they are still relatively small. But I can't give you split for the year. I don't have that kind of detail with me. Julian Mitchell : Sure. And then, if we just look at the Engineered Systems business and the Industrial Parts of Fluids, was there any change in sort of customer behavior in recent months since the beginning of the year. Would you say it's been fairly steady? Robert Livingston : Well, within Engineered Systems, the comments would be slightly different between the printing and ID platform versus the industrial platform. I don't think there has been any changes in the industrial platform. In fact, my comment in the script was that we had good organic growth in our first quarter, in our industrial platform, and you know that I did not call out a single business or two. Like I have done in the past. The growth in the first quarter was very, very broad based in the industrial platform. Within the printing and ID platform, Markem-Imaje, I think organic growth was 3% or a little bit better 3% and 4% fairly solid, right on our expectations, interesting, the strong market was not just the U.S. I would call it the Americas. We had strong growth from Canada through Brazil, but the entire America scheme did a very good job for Markem-Imaje in the first quarter. Little bit lower growth in Europe, but it was still positive. China was a challenge. Now I'll answer your question about profile, I will tell you that and I think I shared this on a call or two last years with respect to both Europe and China. We continue to see a slowdown in a deferral and a longer sales cycle, both in Europe and China with respect to orders that are for what I would refer to as capital goods. If it's for operating type of expenditures that products that we're selling to our customers that activity seems to be holding up fairly well. Julian Mitchell : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Yeah, just a couple of quick questions on segment margins before broader question. Just may be Brad or Bob fluid margins - okay. So fluid margins also impacted by Tokheim accounting this quarter. Can you maybe just size that for us? And also the gain on disposition, did that fall into the ES segments? Robert Livingston : Okay, Brad can give you some detail, but I am going to enjoy giving you a quick response on the fluid margins, Nigel. If you strip out the acquisitions from out of the fluid segment that we completed in 2015 and then Tokheim in January of this year and just look at the core business. We actually had slight margin improvement year-over-year in the first quarter. I think maybe it was modest, but it was still an improvement, I think it was 30 or 40 basis points improvement in the core operating margin. But obviously the acquisitions are coming on board with lower margins than the core and then we have the purchase accounting on top of that. But Brad can probably give you additional color than that. Brad Cerepak : Well, the only thing for the first quarter I would add that you know not having the numbers on top of my head right here. We had in the ES about, I don't know about 7 million or so restructuring cost, if I remember correctly. If I adjust for that restructuring cost and I adjust for then the deal, the margins, the margins and fluids would be about 17.5%. So, we can do the math on that and figure out what the delta is on with respect to the acquisitions. Nigel Coe : Okay, that's - Robert Livingston : Your other question was on the disposition? Nigel Coe : Yeah, that - yes. Robert Livingston : Yeah, that was within the industrial platform of the ES and I think the gain that we, I think we commented on this in the script. I think the gain was $10 million or $11 million. Brad Cerepak : $11 million. Robert Livingston : $11 million. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. And then just Bob, Energy have plus and minus 10% or more organic growth declines for six of the plus eight years and it looks like next couple of years you're going to have strong double-digit growth - Robert Livingston : You mean six of the past eight years. Nigel Coe : Past eight years, no eight years if you get back to 2009. Robert Livingston : Yes, okay. Nigel Coe : Yeah, so I mean, I understand the cycles up, cycles down, but given us the account - is that we have to live with and still remain the growth platform going forward or how you're thinking about energy as part of Dover going forward? Robert Livingston : So, the question is around margins. Let me just - you'd have start you're going to look at it over a longer period of time looking back, you have to start by understanding the effective product mix and acquisitions on the segment margins and I am not just talking about purchase accounting and amortization. But the pure business profile of the acquisitions that we've made over the last four or five years, you go back to 2008, 2009, the two primary businesses within our energy platform as we\u2019ve reported today would be our artificial lift business and our diamond insert business, both of which have margins then and up until 2000 - up until the last, you know, up until the last nine months have had margins higher than the businesses that we\u2019ve been acquiring. So the mix has changed rather significantly, it\u2019s rather difficult to compare the business - the business margin profile of even prior to the downturn even in 2014 to the business profile we had in 2008. And if you wonder have Paul walk that through you on the call later then he'll be glad to do that. Nigel Coe : Yeah. Okay. Thanks a lot. There was no really margins is more typicality of the business, but I\u2019ll follow up offline. Thanks Bob. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan: Hey, it\u2019s a follow-up may be a little bit on Nigel's fluid margins question, if we just think about kind of the margins from here in fluids versus the first quarter run rate, I mean, is all of that acquisition impact, is that just normal like ongoing acquisition accounting or was there any stuff that hit more in 1Q that's going to ease through the year or should we - or this kind of a good all-in one run rate, if we just adjust for the restructuring? Robert Livingston : No, I would say that there is, the answer is typical, there were three acquisitions, we have quite a bit of impact related to inventory turnover in the first quarter that doesn\u2019t continue beyond that, but you do get the normal amortization of the goodwill in the intent, actually the intangibles. So the inventory piece, you know, I would say the first quarter is being impacted by roughly $6 million or $7 millions of inventory, and that doesn\u2019t repeat itself into the second or third, fourth quarters. And then if you think about margins as well on restructuring, we said restructuring was going to be $40 million. If you think about how that\u2019s going to get spend, we had $14 million or so in the first quarter, I would expect by the time we finish the second quarter we'll be about $35 million or so about $40 million spend. So, again as I start to look at first half and second half even for the company, you know, the first half, second half is not traditional what I would say is the split between first half and second half at $48 million to $52 million which it\u2019s showing up in guide rate now was about 43% ,47%, $57 million, but if you adjust for these one-offs that you\u2019re asking about and restructuring and then relook at it at that level, it has closer to 45%, 46% first half. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. That helps. And then just on, Bob your comment on sort of energy being positioned to fully leverage any ventral recovery, price hasn't actually seen that as bad as Jeff was saying earlier, headcounts now down 32% and we\u2019re going to be, hopefully exiting the year around of 10% run rate, so what is that mean, in terms of fully leveraging a recovery, I mean, in a positive scenario, I mean, where do you really think you can get this energy business back to margin wise? Robert Livingston : Again it\u2019s - you tell me what - if I knew what the volume was going to be next year Shannon, I can tell you - I could give you pretty good guess what the margins were going to be, it is very volume sensitive. We commented on the margins that we don\u2019t - the EBITDA numbers are obviously in our filings, but even as we look at our energy segment as - if we close - if we exit the fourth quarter with a 10% operating margin run rate, Shannon, our EBITDA on that business is about 20% in the fourth quarter. And what we have tried to protect very diligently and I commented on the script as well, is our engineering capability and our ability to respond pretty quickly. So when I say we can take advantage of the recovery and leverage the recovery well, when it does come, part of its around our response capability, but we have taken enough fixed cost out of this business in 2015 and 2016, that the incrementals on our volume increase are going to be rather impressive. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. And as a reminder, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. And your next question is coming from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Robert Livingston : Hi, Steve. Good morning. Steve Tusa : Just I guess a lot of numbers floating around here. For the second quarter, you guys I think you've reached - the numbers have changed a bit, but last year I think it was up EPS wise 30% to 35% from first quarter to second quarter. I'm not even sure what number we're using like let's just use I guess the $0.52 number or maybe like $0.55 to $0.60 number. Because there was a lot of moving parts here. But is second quarter going to be better sequentially than last year or because of the energy dynamics, although small impact now or worse than it was last year seasonally. What's kind of a seasonal color, when you kind of mix this all in for the second quarter? Brad Cerepak : Well, okay. I understand the question. I haven't done that calculation Steve. Steve Tusa : Well, I hate to say it's just a question that if you have a view on, if you know what the second quarter is, what is that roughly year-over-year versus the first quarter that\u2019s kind of the baseline question. Brad Cerepak : I actually don't have the detail in front of me, Steve. I'm taking the guess to even try to answer that. Paul Goldberg : Yeah Steve, it's Paul. I would just say that the three segments, Engineered Systems, Fluid and Refrigeration and Food Equipment are clearly are going to be improved sequentially second quarter over first quarter. Bob said energy is going to be down 10% sequentially. So the EPS in the second quarter is going to be substantially above, where we are in the first quarter, but we don't give second quarter guidance. Steve Tusa : Okay. And I guess you guys talked about the energy margin. I assume the energy margin given the revenue decline and as you talked mostly about the back half waiting of, I mean as restructuring coming through et cetera. I assume the energy margins is going to be down in the second quarter. Robert Livingston : We'll actually all in. I'm not sure that's true Steve. All in the first quarter including I say all in including restructuring charges, I think margins were 4%, 4.1% something like that. We actually do start to get some benefits in the second quarter. Steve Tusa : Okay. Robert Livingston : So from those restructuring activities that we're for the most part absent in the first quarter. Because Steve most of the restructuring we took in energy and the first quarter occurred in March. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one last question just on the --. Robert Livingston : I actually expect margins in the second quarter and energy to be a bit better than the first. We actually took out 366 ads in the first quarter in energy. And most of them - in March. Brad Cerepak : So you will see that impact into the second quarter. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then in energy just a follow-up to Nigel's question. I think what he was trying to get at was not necessarily the margin, but just the cyclicality of the business. Is there any part of that business may be drilling perhaps that's going to be little more challenged over the next couple of years? Any parts of those businesses that are up for strategic review and potential divestiture. Obviously you're not going to do the whole segment but are there any parts of that drilling specifically that you'd evaluate as being strategic or non-strategic for the longer-term? Robert Livingston : Good question. And it's something we look at. We something we look at every year not just on energy. But beyond that I'm not going to comment. Steve Tusa : Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. And next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi Group. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Robert Livingston : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning. So I'm trying to reconcile the EPS of sets of acquisition in 2016. You have $0.16 to $0.17 for the year. You've talked about this little bit in your prepared remarks, but you have $0.18 last quarter. But your numbers now include the $0.07 gain from the disposition. And then of course it also includes the earnings from the disposition of the loss of earnings. So can you talk about how are your acquisitions trending? I know it's early but are they lower than you thought in terms of EPS contribution or the same or maybe a little more color there. Robert Livingston : Sure. So you're right. And then last forecast we had a roughly $0.18 from acquisition accretion. Where we're stand today in our forecast, we're at $0.19. So roughly it's the same number let's say at that way. So they're trending fine, some are little bit better. Yeah one's up a penny one, there is no big changes, pretty consistent from our last forecast and the way you reconcile it, you get - you take out the gain that to your point and you add and you also have to, you add back the gain and then you subtract out the lost revenue and earnings of the disposition and that\u2019s about $0.09 or so. Andy Kaplowitz : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And Bob maybe I can ask you specifically about the fluid transfer business if I look at that business it did turn down a little bit you mentioned oil and gas you mentioned lower CapEx spending you didn\u2019t specifically talk about OPW that seems fine, but maybe just a little more color on that business, what turned down in that business? Robert Livingston : So, the OPW first quarter was lighter than we expected and in the first quarter, the softness was almost all, not entirely, but almost all in the retail area. Activity in Canada, our retail fueling was significantly below expectations and even our experience from last year thus the comp part of the reason why I have to comment on the integrated energy companies at least, those are some of our customers in Canada, but we also saw some project timing for shales from the first quarter to second and third from some U.S. retail customers who are pushing out some rebuild projects. Andy Kaplowitz : So, Bob how do we look at OPW for the rest of the year then how do you look at it? Robert Livingston : I would say for the rest of the year, our expectation is it\u2019s going to be less of a call it a negative year-over-year comp in the second quarter and we\u2019re actually feeling fairly positive about by the second half of the year. Andy Kaplowitz : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Dean Dray of RBC. Deane Dray : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hey Bob, hope you give us some color on the - in refrigeration those retail wins you had in the quarter and how does that compare to any sort of seasonal expectations? Robert Livingston : Are you asking it for the customer names, I'm not going to do that, Dean? Deane Dray : I did not ask for customer names but just some color as to what kind of customers or what kind of products? Robert Livingston : For those of you who recall that my comments in the first half of last year on refrigeration what we\u2019re seeing in the fourth quarter and the first quarter was actually what we were expecting to see in the second quarter of last year, it just took us longer to get to this point. As you know, we did take a significant drop down and the step down in the Walmart business and the efforts by the leadership team and the sales organization in Phoenix has been outstanding over the past year to deal with the shortfall and they are covering it. They\u2019re covering it Dean, they\u2019ve done a really good job. In fact I would say that the organic growth for the segment in the first quarter just slightly above 3% was actually about a point better than we expected coming into the year and all of that upside was that of our refrigeration business, primarily, but not all, primarily Phoenix and we feel very, very good with the factory load we have right now for the seasonally strong second quarter and the teams are working pretty feverishly and making sure that we can make that same comment as we entered the third quarter. We actually feel pretty positive right now about the seasonal load that we\u2019re looking at here in the second and third quarter. Deane Dray : And just to clarify so on that filling the Walmart hole, these wins you had they were new customers and that would be considered part of that initiative that you talked about last year about --? Robert Livingston : No the customers Dean, there\u2019s a handful of new customers in there a single handful, but some of it is just winning larger share. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just a clarification on - Robert Livingston : I would like to cover a point here Walmart activity is still not where we would expect it to be even in the remodel activity, the first few weeks of the year were actually pretty modest compared to our expectations. March was sort of back on track. But this is a bit of a different year for Walmart. With respect to communication to at least us and to other suppliers that we're aware of is that they have not announced to their supply base a detailed roll out of remodel activity for 2016, it's sort of being done in month or two at a time. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just\u2026 Robert Livingston : For the year. Deane Dray : Just to clarify on the incremental restructuring that you've announced today. What's the implied payback and you called out the shared service centers a couple times, is that a permanent change and how does that contribute on the cost equation? Robert Livingston : I'm going to have the Brad on the payback. Brad Cerepak : On the restructuring. So let's just cover that for a moment. We said incremental 20 million for total of 40 million. So if you think about what we had in terms of benefits in our last forecast where we are today. The benefits on the 20 million incremental spend is up 50 million. I know that sounds like a big number. But in that 50 million I would say 50% of that is right sizing manufacturing so that hourly work variable cost and the other 50% is attribute to structural type of cost take out and so that's what we have in our forecast. So again some of the you'll see the foot note on one of the charts that 100 million now and the aggregate includes we include all in when we say the headcounts are down 366 heads that's also manufacturing and management and overhead type layers as well. Deane Dray : And the shared services prior the structural change? Brad Cerepak : Well, yes or no, I mean it's not part of a restructuring activity per se. But it surely is a structural change that we are pursuing here at Dover. We've been running pilot programs where two full years now and this year we sort of announced here internally a couple of months ago the role out of the shared service approach around Dover and it's more than just back office. It encompasses from activity around HR some like activity around finance and accounting. But it's more than just accounts payable and accounts receivable it's much more expensive. And I think actually by the time we get the year end 2016 we'll probably we'll have one segment pretty much fully transition to shared service approach and the other 3 perhaps 30 to 50% transitioned to the shared service platform. We are not - in our guide there has actually no benefits, not net benefits in our guide this year from the shared service roll out. We've got some spending and some investment that we are making this year, we are seeing some benefits. But that's not going to be a net benefit. We'll actually start to see the net benefits of this program in the 2017 and 2018. Deane Dray : Thank you. Robert Livingston : Great. Operator : Thank you. Our final question is coming from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys and thanks for fitting me in. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Joe. Joseph Ritchie : Maybe just on that payback question, I think the genesis of the question is a fact that when you take a look at your payback and what you are spending from a restructuring standpoint it looks pretty like really good payback relative to what other industrial companies are seeing. I guess maybe the question is one what gives you the confidence that you can get that payback and then secondly are there any obstacles that you see as you are rolling out your restructuring programs that would potentially inhibit you from saying that same type of benefit. Robert Livingston : Okay. So first-of-all all restructuring activity is not the same. The bulk of not all, but the bulk of the restructuring activity we\u2019ve had and energy both last year 2015 as well as the first half of this year has been people related and my goodness Brad, can I say almost a 100% domestic, maybe almost a 100% North America for sure. And Joe the payback on that is pretty high pretty quick. When you peel off the labor restructuring, the workforce restructuring you look at some of the fixed cost or facility consolidations we did last year and are doing again this year. In a waiting perspective they are pretty minor compared to the benefits we are getting from the workforce reduction and the payback is longer probably more in line with what you are referring to here when you look at the facility consolidations that we have done. But again, most of the work force reduction last year and this year has been North America. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. So I guess the confidence in set in other way your confidence is pretty high - there, okay. And then may be one follow-on question\u2026 Robert Livingston : May be I will get you a very discrete example Brad mentioned that in Energy in the first quarter workforce was reduced by 366 they are either here or not and when they are not I mean the benefits I mean it is a pretty high comfort on that. Joseph Ritchie : Okay, fair enough. And then I guess, I guess the follow-on question there is really since may be focused on Energy for a second. I remember several quarters ago we talked about additional restructuring actions potentially impacting your service levels and yet you know we have seen that there is no restructuring and actions that are needed to be taken on the Energy side of your business. I guess, I am curious, how are you managing that piece of your business and make sure that service levels are interrupted and when we do see recovering? Robert Livingston : So like I commented both on the script and in earlier response, we have as good of a job as we can be holding our engineering capability. In fact, I would say at last year in 2015 we actually added resources in engineering. The 2016 we have tweet a bit around the edges on our service response but we have done it, in a way that we know we have got flexibility to move resources around to handle customer demands today, tomorrow and hopefully here whether it is the second half of this year and next year when you start to see a little bit of the recovery. But we have tried very diligently to protect our response time even though we have then sort of trending at the margins. To that point Joe, I am going to tell you, I do not see a lot more flexibility in the second-half of his year or even going in the next year about restructuring activity at Energy that is in line with what we have done in the second-half of last year or in the first quarter or the second quarter of this year. If there's further revenue declines I think we can always find opportunities at the margin but I am not just being very upfront, I do not see the opportunity to take another $30 million of cost out of Energy in the second-half of this year even if we see a little bit of decline in revenue. Joseph Ritchie : Hey, that's helpful. Thanks, Bob. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : Thank you very much. We just like to thank everybody for their continued interest in Dover. And we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Have a good day. Thank you. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's first quarter 2016 Dover Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our second quarter results excluding deal costs and one-time items were generally in line with our expectations, but disappointing nonetheless. Now, let me share some specific comments on the quarter. Within the quarter, our June revenue, earnings and bookings were significantly improved from April\u2019s results. We expect to see this positive momentum carry into the third quarter and give us confidence for an improved back-half of the year. From a geographic perspective, excluding our Energy segment, our U.S. activity remains solid and grew organically low-single-digits year over year. Our European markets were down sequentially and year over year on an organic basis. China improved sequentially, but remained down from the prior year. We continue to be challenge by weak energy market dynamics. Though we believe that second quarter will mark the low-point of our 2016 performance in our Energy segment, our markets improved, albeit low April, as North American rig count modestly increased and the price of oil remained in the mid- to high-40s. While, the recent trend is encouraging year-over-year rig count and customer CapEx were still down substantially. These factors drove our second quarter revenue down about 9% sequentially. This result was slightly better than expected as we continue to see the positive impact of our share gain initiatives. Engineered Systems\u2019 organic growth was 2%. As the Printing & Identification platform had a very strong quarter posting organic growth of 9%. These outstanding results we\u2019re seeing both by our marking and coding, and digital textile equipment businesses. In the industrial platform, organic revenue declined 2%. This result was primarily driven by environmental solutions due to some deferred activity and tough comps against a very strong second quarter of 2015. Fluids posted 16% revenue growth, driven by several recent acquisitions. On an organic basis revenue declined 8%. Our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure, and those businesses serving integrated energy customers posted declines greater than we anticipated. Our businesses serving the hygienic and food, and pharma continued to show growth. Our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment grew 1% organically, principally driven by increased volume in display and specialty cases with several retail refrigeration customers. In all, retail refrigeration grew 4% organically in the quarter. Our food equipment markets were mixed, where very weak results in our food processing business in Europe offset growth in other food equipment end-markets. Regarding acquisitions, we have closed three deals this year, including Tokheim, and have signed an agreement to acquire Wayne, which we are very excited about. Our teams have been fully engaged planning the integration of Wayne and Tokheim, and the market response to the announcement has been positive. We anticipate the transaction will close around the end of the third quarter. When Wayne closes we will have a $1.4 billion presence in the fuel distribution and retail fueling market, and be able to provide a unique product and service offering to our global customers. This deal along with others furthers our strategy to position Dover with a stronger long-term growth profile. Now, looking forward, within Energy we are maintaining our full-year revenue guidance. We see modest sequential improvement, assuming current oil prices and the North America rig count stay constructive. Initially, we expect our artificial lift business will benefit from increased MRO activity at the well-site. We also believe an increased completion rate for drill, but uncompleted wells will continue, especially in lower cost basins like the Permian. In all, we expect second-half revenue to be about 2% higher than first-half revenue. In Engineered Systems, our expectations for organic growth are unchanged. We expect the marking and coding business to grow mid-single-digits and our digital textile businesses to have double-digit growth. Within our industrial platform, we expect revenue in the second-half to be similar to the first-half. Fluids decline in organic revenue will be more than offset by growth from acquisitions. In our current forecast, we have lowered the high-end of our organic revenue as a result of continued soft markets. We have also reduced our growth rate for Tokheim as China activity in volume and other emerging markets is expected to remain weak in the back-half of the year. We expect the solid growth we\u2019ve seen in our hygienic and pharma markets to continue. Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment we are trimming the high-end of our full-year forecast for organic revenue growth. While our retail refrigeration business remains solid, driven by our leading technology and merchandising solutions, we anticipate can-shaping orders and shipments to push out over year-end. We have a strong backlog within retail refrigeration, and I\u2019m pleased we have made good progress in our productivity and efficiency initiatives. In summary, I feel confident that our energy segment will show modest improvement in the back-half of the year. We expect our U.S. industrial markets to remain positive and for Europe and China to modestly improve. Our pipeline remains active and we expect to announce a few additional deals before year-end. With respect to guidance, we are adjusting our full-year EPS guidance to $3.35 to $3.45, principally reflecting the impact of our full - of our reduced full-year revenue forecast and for deal cost in one-time items. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 3 of our presentation deck. Today, we reported second quarter revenue of $1.7 billion, a decrease of 4%. This result included in organic revenue decline of 7%. Growth from acquisitions less dispositions was 3%. EPS was $0.76 including $0.04 of restructuring costs, deal costs of $0.02 and $0.04 of one-time items. Segment margin for the quarter was 13.1%, 250 basis points below last year. Approximately half of the margin reduction was due to higher year-over-year restructuring deal costs and one-time items. Bookings decreased 2% from the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 6% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. Organic bookings in our Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments grew 4% each, overall book-to-bill finished at 1.01%. Our backlog decreased 6% to $1.1 billion and was down 1%, when excluding dispositions. Of note, backlog increased 2% sequentially, largely reflecting retail refrigeration activity. Free cash flow was $172 million for the quarter or 10% of revenue. Our cash flow conversion to net income benefited from actions to reduce working capital. We expect to generate free cash flow of roughly 11% of revenue for the year. Now, turning to Slide 4, Engineered Systems increased organic revenue 2%, while Refrigeration & Food Equipment was up 1%, these increases reflects solid growth in Printing & Identification and in retail refrigeration. Fluids\u2019 organic decline of 8% was largely driven by oil and gas exposure. Energy organic decline was 28% driven by weak North American oil and gas markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids with 24% growth. Now on Slide 5, Energy revenue of $259 million decreased 29%. Earnings were impacted by restructuring cost of $6 million, as well as other one-time costs of $5 million from our decision to temporarily suspend production at several plants and $2 million in settlement costs. Adjusting for these items, earnings were $13 million and margin was 5% in the quarter. This margin performance largely reflects significant volume declines and price reductions of approximately 2%. We expect $6 million of restructuring charges in the third quarter, $3 million higher than our prior forecast for this segment. We continue to believe we can exit the year with margin near 10%. Bookings were $246 million and book-to-bill was 0.95. Turning to Slide 6, Engineered Systems\u2019 revenue of $592 million was flat overall and included organic revenue growth of 2%. Earnings of $104 million increased 8%, principally reflecting the benefits of productivity, volume leverage and a favorable product mix. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $264 million increased 15%. Organic revenue was up 9% primarily reflecting strong global marking and coding, and digital printing equipment activity. Acquisitions added 8% growth, while FX was 2% negative. In the industrial platform, overall revenue declined 10% to $329 million comprised of an organic decline of 2% and a 7% impact from dispositions. The organic revenue decline primarily reflected activity deferrals in tough comps in our environmental solutions business. Margin was 17.6%, a 130 basis point improvement. Bookings of $571 million were up 2%, which included organic bookings growth of 4%. Organically, printing and identification bookings increased 14% and industrial bookings decreased 2%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.01. Industrials book-to-bill of 0.93 reflects deferred order activity with environmental solutions. Overall book-to-bill was 0.96. Now, moving to Slide 7, within Fluids, revenue increased 16% to $406 million, while earnings decreased 23% to $54 million. Revenue performance reflects 24% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by an 8% decline in organic revenue. The organic decline was driven by our businesses with direct oil and gas exposure, lower spending in certain integrated energy customers, particularly retail fueling and project timing. This decline was partially offset by continued solid results in our hygienic and pharma markets. Regarding acquisition growth, our retail fueling activity in China was weak, as were other emerging markets. Margin declined 670 basis points in the quarter, reflecting lower organic volume, the impact of acquisitions, $4 million in deal costs and $3 million in incremental restructuring costs. Excluding acquisitions related deal costs and restructuring margin was 19.4%, a decrease of 80 basis points over an adjusted prior year. Bookings were $414 million, an increase of 24%. This result primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis bookings declined 1%. Book-to-bill was 1.02. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8, Refrigeration & Food Equipment\u2019s revenue of $429 million was down 4% overall and included organic revenue growth of 1%. Earnings of $63 million declined 4% from the prior year. Earnings were flat with last year after adjusting for our recent disposition. Organic revenue growth was largely driven by increased volume with several retail refrigeration customers, especially in the display and specialty case product lines. Within Food Equipment results were mixed. Solid results in commercial food service and can shaping equipment were offset by weak European food processing equipment results. Margin was 14.7%, unchanged from last year. Bookings were $469 million, down 4%. This result includes 4% organic growth, offset by dispositions and FX. Organic growth was primarily driven by strong retail refrigeration bookings. Book-to-bill was a seasonally strong 1.09. Of note, book-to-bill for retail refrigeration was 1.13 as compared to 1.06 last year. Going to the overview on Slide 9, let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $25 million and net interest expense was $32 million, both largely in line with our expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 27.3% excluding discrete tax costs, slightly lower than our prior forecasted rate. CapEx was $35 million in the quarter. Now, moving to Slide 10, which shows our full-year guidance, as Bob mentioned, our 2016 revenue guidance has been adjusted on the high-end to reflect reduced forecast for Fluids, and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. We now expect total revenue to decrease 3% to 5%. Within this estimate, organic revenue is expected to decline 6% to 8% as compared to our prior forecast of down 5% to 8%. We expect acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth, partially offset by dispositions and FX. At the midpoint of our guidance, adjusted segment margin is expected to be around 15%, excluding restructuring and deal costs and one-time items. Corporate expense is now anticipated to be $108 million for the year, $12 million below our prior forecast on reduced spending. Our full year forecast for interest expense is unchanged and the pre-discrete tax rate has been slightly lowered to be in the range of 27.5% to 28%. From a segment perspective, Energy and Engineered System\u2019s full-year organic revenue forecasts are unchanged from our prior guidance. Fluids\u2019 organic revenue has been reduced two points on the high-end, and now is forecasted to decline 4% to 5%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment organic revenue has been lowered one point at the high-end and now stands at 2% to 3%. The impact of acquisitions, dispositions, and FX remains unchanged. Turning to the 2016 bridge on Slide 11, let\u2019s start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We continue to expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring cost in 2016 to be $0.07. Performance including volume, productivity pricing and restructuring benefits will impact earnings $0.37 to $0.31. This is reduced $0.20 from our prior forecast and now includes $0.05 of deal costs and $0.04 of one-time costs. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.20 to $0.17, reflecting roughly $0.02 lower spend from our prior forecast. Acquisition plus dispositions will be about $0.12 accretive in total, $0.04 lower than our prior forecast, primarily driven by slower activity in China retail fueling markets and other emerging markets. The combined impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate is about $0.06 better than our prior forecast, driven by reduced corporate expense and a slightly lower tax rate. Lastly, discrete tax benefits of $0.04 are included in our forecast. In total, we expect 2016 EPS to be $3.35 to $3.45, down about $0.19 at the midpoint from our prior guidance. Approximately, $0.09 of this reduction is attributable to deal costs and one-time cost, and a remainder is driven by a lower revenue forecast in Fluids and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, offset in part by lower corporate expense and a reduced tax rate. With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Bob for some final comments. Robert Livingston : Thanks, Brad. Let me share some summary comments, as we move into the back-half of our year. We saw a strong organic booking growth in Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment, which sets them up well for their second-half revenue plan. In energy, we expect improved sequential performance driven by modestly improving markets, share gain initiatives and a reduced cost base. We also see a renewed focus on land-based drilling and production, especially in lower cost basins. Within Fluids, second-half revenues will be up to seasonality in our retail fueling business and continued strength in our pharma and hygienic applications. We are excited about our growth and margin expansion opportunities in the retail fueling market, especially with the addition of Wayne. I am pleased with the many positive changes we\u2019ve made to our business profile over the last few years. We now have several large businesses with global scale and you should expect us to continue the strategy of creating great businesses across our growth markets. In all, I believe we\u2019ll demonstrate much stronger performance in the second-half. We remain focused on improving our financial performance and increasing shareholder value. With that, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. And now, Paul, let\u2019s take some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks, Bob. Before we take the first question, I just like to remind you as a courtesy, we have several people in queue. So if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, we\u2019ll be able to take more questions. And with that, Kirsten, if we can have the first question. Operator : Certainly, our first question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Good morning, guys. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Andrew. Brad Cerepak : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : I\u2019ve just a question and I\u2019ve been getting a lot of questions from investors this morning on Energy. Can you just give us some more color as to what gives you reassurance? I mean, the book-to-bill is still below 1 on Energy. What gives you reassurances that things are in fact improving? And when do you think we\u2019re going to start seeing improved bookings? And just a follow-up, I\u2019ll to the follow-up right now, on Fluids, on pumps how bad is the weakness and how long do you think it will last? So these are my questions. Thank you. Robert Livingston : All right, good. Energy, I think, we started to see the change in Energy in the second quarter, Andrew. There was - actually in my prepared comments, I made a comment that June was much stronger than April and that comment was across the board within Dover. But it was noticeably so within Energy. Our upstream order activity and Energy in June was up 18% over April. And our expectation for the third quarter and Energy order rates here in the first two, three weeks of July, we\u2019re actually running slightly ahead of our third quarter forecast, especially in what we will label as the early cycle business activity around our rods and our ESP pumps. We see the term and we feel fairly confident with our forecast for the second-half of the year. In fact, I would - I think another two or three weeks of order activity, like we\u2019ve seen in the past three weeks, maybe I would label the revenue and earnings forecast for Energy as having a little bit of upside for the year. Andrew Obin : And on Fluids? Robert Livingston : Fluids, the oil-and-gas hit is in our pumps business, and it\u2019s not just standard. For the most part we\u2019ve been dealing with declines in our standard pumps through distribution, which we continue to see a little bit of that here in the second quarter. It was a bit more than we expected. But the most significant thing in the second quarter was the loss of a - I will label it as an oil and gas project. We lost it on price and it was within our engineered pumps business group, not our standard pumps. It was a one-off order. Andrew Obin : And do you have a sense how long you think - when do you think orders there start turning positive or could flatten out? Robert Livingston : Yes, within the oil and gas piece of our Fluids that one is tough to call. If you look back at the - as our Energy cycle or as the Energy cycle started, we probably didn\u2019t see a measurable downturn in our pumps business for probably at least three months after we started to see the downturn in our Energy segment. If we truly are at a turning point here in the Energy cycle, Andrew, my best guess is we are not going to see much of a change in order activity within our pumps business related to oil and gas into early next year. Andrew Obin : Terrific, thank you very much. Robert Livingston : We are not forecasting anything, any pickup in our pumps business related to oil and gas in the second half, that\u2019s for sure. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Good morning, guys. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Hey, Bob, maybe just a little more explanation on the thought process around the plant shutdowns you decided to do in Energy during the quarter. And then, I think, Brad said that you are ramping up the restructuring more of the third quarter. Yes, that sort of - in the same mix that you\u2019re sounding, you\u2019re sounding lot more positive on the market. So it seems like you\u2019re doing shutdowns and more restructuring, but believing in the turn, so may be reconcile those. Robert Livingston : As we entered the second quarter, we did have additional restructuring plan, especially in our rods and our pump businesses around artificial lift. And as April unfolded, even though it was as bad as we expected, Shannon, we were sort of firming our opinion that we would see a turn here in the rig count, before the end of the second quarter. And we made a decision to hold the workforce intact in May and June instead of having employee separations. We shut - I believe you know the count. I think it was at least four factories down for two weeks in the second quarter instead of employee separations. It did call some P&L charges to the quarter that we did not have in our initial forecast or planning, but I would tell you now, recognizing the change in the order rate activity during June, I\u2019m glad we made that decision, the restructuring that we have scheduled for the third quarter, and I think it\u2019s primarily in the third quarter, isn\u2019t it for Energy? Brad Cerepak : Yes, in the third quarter, it\u2019s incrementally up $3 million in Energy, but in total. Robert Livingston : In Energy, but it\u2019s in artificial lift interest\u2026 Brad Cerepak : Just in total for the company we\u2019re still forecasting the same level of total restructuring, but Energy is up. And, maybe, Bob, you want to\u2026 Robert Livingston : Yes. And the restructuring activity in the third quarter is not in artificial lift, it\u2019s in a couple of the other businesses. And, Shannon, I would - Brad, correct me if I\u2019m wrong. But I think the charges we have in the third quarter, we do expect the benefits in the second-half of 2016 to equal or be even better than the charges we take. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, great. Thanks. And then, just on Fluid margins, as we work up from kind of a 2Q level on Fluid margins to the back-half where do you see them going, I know the elimination of, I guess, the Wayne dale costs will be part of the lift. What else we have going on and what do you think Fluid margins look like for the year now? Robert Livingston : So reported Fluid margins in the quarter were a little better than 13%, but if you adjust for - if you adjust for restructuring and some of our one-time cost, especially our deal cost that we had in the second quarter, it\u2019s 19%. It is interesting to still note, Shannon, that if we look at our core business. And now I\u2019m excluding our acquisitions that we\u2019ve added here over the past, over the past several months, our core business excluding restructuring and one-time cost was 19.4%. And our forecast for the year in this segment on the same basis - just looking at the core, the margins on our core business, excluding deal cost, 19.9%, almost 20%. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: And then, what you think it is going to look like kind of on a reported basis at this point? Robert Livingston : All cost in 16% - 15.5% to 16%. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Sorry to just belabor this, so the deal costs go away versus 2Q when you\u2019re at 13.3%, what else lifts you from 13% up to, say, like high-teens in the back-half all in? Robert Livingston : Shannon, a big change in the second-half with respect to Fluids is volume improvement. You\u2019re going to have to help me here, Brad, with the number, but I think the volume increase in the second-half over the first-half. And I don\u2019t have it compared to the second quarter, but I\u2019m just doing second-half versus first-half. I think the volume improvement is about a $100 million, maybe even slightly more than that, but rough number $100 million. And that\u2019s driven by the normal seasonality we\u2019re expecting in our retail fueling business and continued strength in our hygienic and Pharma markets. And we do have a change here in the second-half. We feel like we\u2019ve got the benefit of some favorable product mix in the second-half. We\u2019re going to have very good conversion on this volume in the second-half. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay. Great, thanks guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Hi, thank you. Robert Livingston : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Hi, just a question on overall on organic sales growth, so organic sales fell about 7% in the first-half, the year as a whole implies down 7% for the second-half. But you talked about a big or a - or a meaningful sort of delta across the board in June relative to April. So I\u2019m just trying to understand why there is no improvement in sales given an easier comp in the back-half? Robert Livingston : Well, that answer maybe starts and ends with a comment on Energy. Even though, sequentially we are forecasting a very modest improvement in Energy. Our organic revenue in the second-half within our Energy segment is still down 19% versus last year. Julian Mitchell : Okay. And then secondly, within Fluids, on the booking side bookings have been sort of flattish organically, but our six months the organic sales worse than that. So maybe just give us a little bit of insight into how much of Fluids is sort of book and ship, and how much visibility the recent bookings give you on the three to six months sales looking out? Robert Livingston : Sure, if I define book and ship, let\u2019s say, bookings that ship within 90 days, not necessarily within 30 days, my guess would be, Julian, that 75% of Fluids bookings would fall into the book and ship category, book and ship within 90 days. We did see a significant increase in bookings within this segment, as we moved through the quarter. In fact, the - we started to see, it was a bit late. We actually started - we actually expected to see this in May and it didn\u2019t happen. But the June order rates within Fluids were up 13% or 14% versus April. And this is the start of our seasonal period within retail Fueling and we expect to see that continue. I\u2019d add a little bit of extra color. If we look at the order rates for the first two to three weeks of July, across the board our order rates are very supportive of our third quarter forecast. Julian Mitchell : Very helpful, thank you. Robert Livingston : We will see a significant increase in retail fueling business activity in the second-half. Julian Mitchell : Great, thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Alfred Ritchie : Thank you. Maybe just following upon\u2026 Robert Livingston : Good morning, Joe. Joseph Alfred Ritchie : Hey, good morning. Maybe just following up on that last point on the expectation for a big increase in the second-half of the year, you took Tokheim forecast for the year. I\u2019m just curious - give maybe a little bit more color Tokheim. Does that have negative implications for Wayne? And what is - why do you believe that we are going to see a pickup in the second-half in retail fueling? Robert Livingston : Well, number one on Tokheim, the reduction in our revenue forecast for Tokheim for the year is almost exclusively China. I think it\u2019s, what was it? $14 million is our reduction in the Tokheim revenue forecast. And, Joe, I think we\u2019ve got 12 of that. Brad Cerepak : 12 of it is China. Robert Livingston : \u2026is China. We expect Europe to exhibit the normal seasonality that historically has been seen in this market. And our second quarter order activity reflects that. In fact, I think our European dispenser order rates in the second quarter, especially in June were quite strong with Tokheim. And I think even for the entire second quarter dispenser bookings - dispenser book-to-bill I think was 1.2. Brad Cerepak : It was 1.2. Robert Livingston : \u2026for the second quarter. We are at the front-end of that build in the seasonal ramp in the retail fueling business. Joseph Alfred Ritchie : Got it, okay. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe, I guess, switching gears, my second question on Energy. The expectation that we could do double-digit - exit the year with double-digit margins, maybe kind of talk me through some of the puts and takes on the restructuring side, because it seems like you\u2019re implying some pretty low detrimentals to exit the year at that rate, even if organic growth is slightly better. So I\u2019m just kind of curious on how we\u2019re getting there? Robert Livingston : You want to help me with this one, Brad? The plan - what is in our plan and our guidance right now are operating margins within the Energy segment, I think of 9.7% or 9.8% for the fourth quarter. Am I correct? Brad Cerepak : Yes, yes. Robert Livingston : Okay. Almost 10%, as I shared in my comments. And we are be - I think we are actually being cautious with this. We are not baking into our expectations, our forecast. I would say the traditional incremental margins that we see on increased revenue within Energy, we have some businesses that have traditionally incrementaled up - converted up, very, very strongly. I think our conversion that we are using in the second-half of the year I think it\u2019s in the low-30s - 32% or 34%. Traditionally that would\u2019ve been 40%, if not, a bit higher. I think we\u2019re being cautious with respect to anticipating continuing price pressures. And perhaps a little bit of uncertainty as to which product lines actually see the uptick in revenue in the second-half. It is worth noting that here early in July, and I\u2019m repeating myself, we are seeing some - we\u2019re seeing the order rates in our rods business and our ESP pump business come in a bit stronger than our third quarter forecast. Brad Cerepak : Yes, and, Joe, I guess what I would add to that is first-half restructuring in DE is about $12 million of cost. Second-half we\u2019re looking at half of that, most of that being in the third quarter. With respect to benefits though, benefits are also doubling themselves into the back-half of year. So the first-half benefits on restructurings, moving into the back-half give us strength into the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s also helping us in our view that we can get to 10% margins. Joseph Alfred Ritchie : Got it, so basically you\u2019re going to hold - you\u2019re going to try to hold margins year-over-year. I mean, organic growth is still going to be negative in the fourth quarter. But the restructuring benefit should help offset. Is that fair? Brad Cerepak : That\u2019s correct. Robert Livingston : Yes. Correct. Joseph Alfred Ritchie : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Robert Livingston : Hi, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Good morning. Hey, hello, could we just touch on price a little bit more? I think they\u2019re down too, that you mentioned, Bob, is in the zone relative to what you were expecting for the year. A little bit of erosion from Q1 and your comment in Q1 was interesting that you thought price wasn\u2019t worse, because there is not enough demand for people to you see any elasticity and therefore why cut price. I just wonder now if you\u2019re seeing this little pulse of activity how people are behaving on price perhaps it\u2019s too earlier really know. Robert Livingston : Yes, it\u2019s too early to answer that one, because I would say the pulse in activity is about six weeks old, Jeff. I\u2019ll give you a comp. I think our negative price in the first quarter within Energy for the segment was just a hair under 1%. In the second quarter, it\u2019s a full 2%. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. Robert Livingston : But it wasn\u2019t - I don\u2019t think it was any different in June than it was in April. Okay, that\u2019s getting to the heart of your question. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. And I think you were seeing much that minus 1 or 90 basis points whatever it was in Q1 reflected I think high-single-digits declines in rods and maybe parts of the ESP business. Is that not\u2026 Robert Livingston : And our diamond inserts. Jeffrey Sprague : Diamond inserts? Robert Livingston : Yes. Jeffrey Sprague : I\u2019m sure you had a chance to look or listen to Halliburton yesterday, their comment that 900 is the new 2000 as it relates to absorbing horsepower in the rig count. Some of what they said may not be totally analogous to you. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re familiar with what they said. But how do you respond to that? Obviously, part of what they\u2019re saying is longer depths and the like, which would apply you, some of it is pumping more sand, which probably doesn\u2019t. But is there anything you could share with us in terms of Dover value per rig or any changes in kind of the mix of your business that may kind of soften that direct correlation to the rig-count that we\u2019re seeing historically. Robert Livingston : Near term, I don\u2019t think there is, Jeff. I think for the next couple or three quarters you\u2019re going to see especially - again, especially within our upstream business activity you\u2019re going to continue to see a pretty high correlation with rig count. The longer laterals do benefit us with respect to rods and the pricing around some of our pumps. And I think it will also benefit us. We may not see it right away, but I think it will benefit us with respect to our automation business. Jeffrey Sprague : Then just one last one, you probably have little more real-time data than I do, but kind of the commentary around the ducks, [ph] what I had heard, there is just really not any major change in kind of the uncompleteds out there. Are you in fact starting to see that, perhaps that\u2019s more in the data in the last month or so? Robert Livingston : Yes, and I would - you are correct. I would say it\u2019s all within the last month there. The change in June wasn\u2019t stark, but what there was a rate change in June. And I think - I have, I commented this in my prepared comments. I think we will see increased activity around well completions in the second-half. Jeffrey Sprague : Right, thank you very much guys. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, due to time restraints, we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Our next question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein. Steve Winoker : Good morning. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Steve. Steve Winoker : You maybe just - I just wanted to follow-up one of those earlier points. You\u2019ve got, I recall $95 million or so projected savings in 2016 from restructuring. How far through are you? And you still see that as the number? Robert Livingston : You\u2019re going to help me on this one, Brad. Brad Cerepak : I would say, okay, so $95 million. That $95 million has increased since our last discussion on this topic. So I would say at this point we\u2019re about $10 million higher. And remember in the $95 million there is carryover in that number, but which completely from 2015. But in terms of our restructuring we expect to have the 2016 action substantially complete here early in the third quarter. And the benefits flowing through in our P&L this year, again I was talking Energy before between first half, second-half. If I look at the total company incrementally new benefits over the carryover that number again in first-half doubles itself into the back-half. So we had - think about it this way, we probably had $20 million of savings in the first-half, we\u2019ll see $40 million plus in the back-half of savings plus the incremental piece get you the - let\u2019s call it $105 million, roughly speaking, benefits. Steve Winoker : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, could you maybe talk a little bit more about, I guess, let\u2019s say, something positive here around Wayne. You laid out for some high-level expectations earlier, when you announced the transaction dilutive in 2016, modestly accretive in 2017, and more accretive in 2018, I guess, the EBITDA in the 130 range including run rate synergies. You have any more clarity around what you\u2019re expecting there, early view, maybe even down in EPS, any thoughts? I\u2019m going to try. Robert Livingston : Before Brad answers you, I think he is prepared to, let me tell you that even though we believe right now we can close this in the third quarter that\u2019s not entirely under our control. And it is possible that this moves into the early fourth quarter as a close and that will have depending upon the quarter, even though it may only be three or four weeks difference that that will have a bit of an impact on the - impact it has on our results in 2016. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Robert Livingston : Now with that qualifier - but there are lots of qualifiers here, Steve. Brad Cerepak : But let me start by saying that when we talked about - let me just clarify the P&L that we have, the forecast that we currently give you here in this update. It includes deal costs in the second and third quarter in our Fluids business, which we highlighted that\u2019s all related to Wayne. What we don\u2019t have in our forecast, is any contingent upon completion costs, which will come at the time we complete the deal. If we complete the deal at the end of the third quarter here going into the fourth quarter, we feel pretty confident with the numbers that we had previously stated about the amount of sales that they expect for 2016. We said 550. I think they are actually right on that number to doing quite well, quite frankly. So without giving a lot of details around seasonality, if you took one fourth of that number, and then you looked at deal costs and amortization step-ups and the like, our view is it will be in the fourth quarter, incremental to the forecast we just gave you, dilutive, because of again finalization of deal costs, amortization step-ups hitting the P&L, positive operationally. But after those costs dilutive and then of course you would have the funding costs or the interest costs associated with the purchase price of $780 million that would also hit the P&L in the fourth quarter. Steve Winoker : Okay, okay. And Bob, your comments, are you saying, you weren\u2019t saying it\u2019s more likely it\u2019s going to hit the fourth quarter, you\u2019re just saying possible. Robert Livingston : No, right now our opinion is that it could close in the third quarter. I\u2019m just repeating myself, we don\u2019t control that. Steve Winoker : Yes. Okay, thank you, guys. Robert Livingston : We are fully prepared for it to move into the fourth quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Stephen Tusa : Hi, hey, good morning. Robert Livingston : Good morning, Steve. Stephen Tusa : So just to be clear on what you\u2019re saying on this Fluids stuff, to get to a 15%, close to a 16% margin, that implies something in kind of the - I don\u2019t know, what\u2019s kind of the second-half total profit number? I mean, I have $100 million to start with here in the first-half. Typically over the last three years pretty consistently you\u2019ve been up, half-over-half around high-single-digit. This would seem to be a more dramatic type of increase. I mean, almost like I don\u2019t know, almost 650 to $60 million maybe $70 million bucks. I mean, I\u2019m just kind of struggling with, why you have this kind of confidence? Robert Livingston : All cost in - you are using all cost in as opposed to adjusted numbers. So our revenue we\u2019re looking in a better $100 million revenue increase in the second half. And, yes, you are correct, the earnings increase in the second half is just about $60 million. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And you\u2019re saying that is for a Tokheim business that is underperforming, you\u2019re saying that\u2019s on kind of an organic basis, that\u2019s the retail fueling business? Robert Livingston : That\u2019s the Tokheim European activity that we expect to be much stronger in the second half and a significant increase in the OPW business with respect to retail fueling in the second half. And the absence of some charges that we had in the first half that aren\u2019t repeating. Stephen Tusa : But you do have some deal charges in Wayne, I mean is it R&D take more deal charges in Wayne in the second-half as well? Robert Livingston : We - I think, we have, what, $3 million to $4 million? Brad Cerepak : We are, Steve, but we did have from the original Tokheim deal, we had rollover of these inventory step ups\u2026 Stephen Tusa : From all the acquisitions? Brad Cerepak : And all the acquisitions, Gavorez, [ph] all that in the first half, they don\u2019t repeat itself. So the standard amortization stays in place in the second half, but that big inventory rollover is gone, as is restructuring - restructuring in the second half is less than the first half. But you are right, deal costs for Wayne first half to second half in the forecast is basically the same number. Stephen Tusa : Okay. Is Tokheim on it kind of a run rate basis is Tokheim making money on common all-in, including the amortization that kind of stuff? Robert Livingston : Including amortization in the first half, I think it was slightly better than breakeven, and the loses which we took, the charges we took in China. And the second quarter, I don\u2019t have - the second quarter was when we made the transition. And we started to see the improved activity at Tokheim, I think it was in May. Steve, the Tokheim, I think 80% of our earnings for Tokheim are actually in the second half of the year. Brad Cerepak : But after the amortization, the answer is, yes, it is possible, it is accretive. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then one last question just on energy. What you see the third quarter being there from a margin perspective? Robert Livingston : Oh, goodness. I don\u2019t have that, it\u2019s less than the - it\u2019s less than our forecast for the fourth quarter\u2026 Brad Cerepak : It\u2019s kind of linear, it\u2019s linear\u2026 Robert Livingston : So you got the back-end to that, yes. Brad Cerepak : Yes, it\u2019s linear coming out of the second quarter. Robert Livingston : 5% to 7%. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Stephen Tusa : Okay. That makes sense. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Good morning. Hi. Robert Livingston : Hi Nigel. Nigel Coe : So just wanted to I mean, cover obviously lot of the major topics. Just wanted to dig into Engineered Systems, the strength in P&I, that\u2019s normally pretty steady business, so the strength you called out is a bit surprising, especially given the underlying production backdrop. So just maybe, Bob, Brad, if you could just address that, maybe throw in color on new products, market share gains et cetera. Robert Livingston : Yes. Well, the product ID had a very strong quarter Nigel, thank you. The core business, the business we\u2019ve owned for a long time our marking and coding business, help me here with my recall, I think organic growth for the quarter was 6%. Brad Cerepak : Yes, 5%, 6%. Robert Livingston : That was strong, but we\u2019ve been working lot of issues there over the last year or so and we\u2019ve seen a lot of improvements in the business. I\u2019ll give you a little bit of color on the marking and coding business beyond that. Sequentially, the business was up I think, 8% or 9% coming out of the first quarter. Nigel, it\u2019s around the world with the exception of China. It\u2019s around the world with the exception of China. In fact, organic growth for the marking and coding business may have actually been higher in Europe in the second quarter than it was here in the States, which is a bit of a change. But our - we had very strong organic growth here in North America. I think, organic growth in Europe may have been 7% or 8%. And we saw it in both increased sales of equipment as well as consumables. And I would also say it continued to build through the quarter. Nigel Coe : But I\u2019m assuming the underlying market is not growing. Robert Livingston : But what looks - pardon? Nigel Coe : So I\u2019m assuming the underlying market is not growing at those kinds of levels, so I\u2019m just wondering what drove the up-movements [ph]. Robert Livingston : We view the underlying market that this business is serving with a growth of about 3%. Nigel Coe : Okay, okay. And then you mentioned the environmental solutions business down some deferrals there. Waste management at the well [and the pumps at the well] [ph] is doing quite well right now. So I\u2019m just wondering if you have any context on why there might be some deferrals. And maybe just remind us, how does this business cycle with the broader truck cycle. Robert Livingston : I\u2019m not sure I have a correlation for you with respect to the broader truck cycle. And my opinion would be that it\u2019s not very highly correlated financial. In fact, I would tell you that when the truck cycle is up it does create some challenges for our business in just getting customer deliveries on time. The second quarter - we expect to see growth in this business for the year. We expect to see growth in the industrial platform in the year. I think we have a schedule or planned it at 2%. We saw some projects slip out from the second quarter into the balance of the year. I wouldn\u2019t label it as slip or slips or deferrals with the two major haulers, but more with municipalities, and a recent acquisition with two of the smaller players - a recent merger of two of the smaller players. Nigel Coe : Okay, okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. But I almost understand it. I can\u2019t agree with the second-half versus first-half. And I believe we can\u2019t get the $100 million of sales ramp up, but we\u2019ll follow-up offline. Thanks, guys. Robert Livingston : Okay. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we had now exceeded our allotted time for Q&A. And it\u2019s my pleasure to hand our program back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : Yes, thank you very much for joining us for the second quarter earnings call. In advance, I\u2019ll apologize for any people who didn\u2019t get on. We tried to get more calls on, but they kind of dragged on a little bit. So I will follow up with you later in the quarter and we look forward to talking to you in the third quarter. Thanks a lot. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s second quarter 2016 Dover Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our third quarter results were disappointing. As the continuing weak macro environment further declines in longer cycle oil and gas applications and production inefficiencies and our retail refrigeration business impacted both volume and earnings. These results were well below our expectations, and more than offset solid improvements in our upstream drilling and production businesses, as well as continued strong performance in our Printing & Identification platform. From a geographic perspective our US and China activity declined organically, both sequentially and year-over-year. On an organic basis our European markets improved sequentially and year-over-year. Within Energy, revenue was up 5% sequentially largely within our drilling and production markets, this improvement was driven by increases in the North American rig count principally in the Permian. The recent trends in rig count and oil price are constructive and supportive of continued near term improvement in our early cycle businesses. That said, within this segment we continue to be challenged in longer cycle applications. Engineered systems organic growth of 1% was driven by another strong quarter in Printing and Identification which posted organic growth of 5%. And the Industrial Platform organic revenue declined 2%, though our vehicle service equipment business had a very strong quarter. Fluids posted 17% revenue growth driven by acquisitions. However our organic revenue declined of 9% reflects activity reductions in our businesses with longer cycle oil and gas exposure as well as tough comps. Lastly, growth in retail fueling was less than anticipated while our businesses serving to hygienic and pharma markets continue to show very strong growth. Refrigeration and food equipment revenue declined 2% organically principally driven by tough comps and can-shaping equipment. Margin performance was well below expectations at Hillphoenix primarily driven by production challenges in case manufacturing. We continue to implement changes to improve the business. Regarding acquisitions we have closed two deals since our last earning call both in Engineered Systems. We added a small Automation and Data Analytics business and also acquired a European Lift business. The addition of the lift business gives us a $500 million platform into growing vehicle service equipment market. We also recently announced that the Wayne acquisition due to an extended regulatory review in the UK will now likely close in the first quarter. Our teams are actively exploring measures to satisfy the regulators\u2019 concerns as quickly as possible, this matter relates only to the UK dispenser business which is very small in the context of the transaction. Now looking forward. Within Energy, we are encouraged by the recent improvements in North American rig count and oil prices and believe both are constructive for continued near term improvements in our business. That said we anticipate our longer cycle oil and gas related businesses to remain sequentially flat. In Engineered Systems, we anticipate activity and our industrial platform to remain soft due to a challenging macro industrial environment as well as from activity deferrals, as some customers push out order delivery in 2017. We expect our Printing and ID platform to have strong growth. Fluids overall growth will be less than we expected in our prior forecast, driven by continued weak longer cycle oil and gas markets as well as CapEx reductions like integrated energy customers. We expect the strong growth we\u2019ve seen in our hygienic and pharma markets to continue. Finally within Refrigeration and Food Equipment, we expect customer spending to slow as we close out the year. We also expect margin challenges to continue as we work to improve manufacturing at Hillphoenix. And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today we reported third quarter revenue of $1.7 billion a decrease of 4%. This result included in organic revenue decline of 7% growth from acquisitions less dispositions was 3%, EPS was $0.83. Segment margin for the quarter was 14.1% below last year largely driven by lower revenue and the impact of acquisitions and production inefficiencies. Bookings decreased slightly from the prior year to $1.7 billion. Within this result, acquisition growth of 6% was more than offset by the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets dispositions and FX. Organic bookings in Engineered Systems grew 5%, Refrigeration and Food Equipment grew 6%, while Energy was down 22% and Fluids decreased 9%. Overall book-to-bill finished at 0.99. Our backlog increased 4% to $1.1 billion or 1% organically. Fresh cash flow was $189 million for the quarter or 11% of revenue. We remain on track to generate free cash flow roughly 11% of revenue for the full year. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 4. Engineered Systems organic revenue increased 1% reflecting solid growth in printing identification partially offset by soft industrial markets. Refrigeration and Food Equipments declined 2% driven by tough comps and can-shaping equipment and softer customer spending in retail refrigeration. Fluids organic decline of 9% was largely driven by upstream and midstream oil and gas exposure tough comps and lower than expected growth in retail fueling. Energy organic revenue was down 24%. As seen on the chart acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at fluids with 27%. Now on Slide 5. Energy revenue of $273 million decreased 25%, on a sequential basis revenue increased 5% driven by our upstream drilling and artificial lift businesses. Earnings of $13 million included restructuring cost of $5 million. Adjusting for these costs earnings were $18 million and margin was 6.8% in line with our expectations and sequentially improved. Current quarter activity, order activity remains positive and we believe we\u2019re on track to exit the year with margin near 10%. Bookings were $271 million, a 10% sequential improvement. Book-to-bill finished at 0.99. Now on Slide 6. Engineered Systems revenue of $571 million was up 1% organically. Earnings of $97 million decreased 5% principally reflecting the impact of a disposition and also impacted by business mix. Our Printing and Identification platform revenue of $253 million increased to 11%. Organic revenue was up 5% reflecting solid global marketing and coding and strong digital printing activity. Acquisitions added 7% growth. In the Industrial Platform revenue was $317 million which included in organic decline of 2%. The organic revenue decline was fairly broad based and also reflected activity deferrals into the first quarter at environmental solutions. Margin was 17% and 80 basis point decline. Bookings of $580 million were up 3% which included organic growth of 5% in both platforms. Book-to-bill for Printing and Identification was 0.98, industrial book-to-bill was 1.04, overall book-to-bill was 1.02. Now on Slide 7. Within Fluids revenue increased 17% to $413 million while earnings decreased 12% to $66 million. Revenue performance reflects 27% growth from acquisitions partially offset by a 9% decline in organic revenue. The organic result was driven by declines in our longer cycle upstream and midstream oil and gas businesses and tough comps reflecting $18 million in project shipments last year that did not repeat. In addition spending from certain integrated energy customers particularly in retail fueling was lower than anticipated. This decline was partially offset by very strong results in our hygienic and pharma markets. Margin declined 530 basis points reflecting lower organic volume and the impact of acquisitions and deal cost. Bookings were $414 million, an increase of 16%, this result primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions on an organic basis, bookings declined 9%. Book-to-bill was 1. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8. Refrigeration and Food Equipments revenue was $451 million included an organic revenue decline of 2%. Earnings of $64 million declined 16% from the prior year largely driven by production challenges at Hillphoenix, the impact of the disposition and product mix. The organic revenue decline was largely driven by tough comps in our can-shaping business. Margin was 14.2%, a 140 basis points below last year. Within this result production inefficiencies at Hillphoenix were $6 million or about 130 basis points of the decline. Bookings of $429 million were flat year-over-year and included organic growth of 6%. Organic growth was largely driven by strong order activity in our can-shaping business which will be shipped in 2017. Book-to-bill was 0.95. Let\u2019s go to the overview Slide on Page 9. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $27 million and net interest expense was $33 million both largely in line with expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was 28% generally in line with expectations. CapEx was $43 million in the quarter. Now moving to Slide 10 which shows our full year guidance. Our 2016 revenue guidance has been adjusted to reflect reduced forecast. We now expect total revenue to decrease 4% to 5%. Within this estimate organic revenue is expected to decline 7% to 8%. We continue to expect acquisitions will add approximately 7% growth partially offset by dispositions and FX. From a segment perspective, Energy\u2019s organic decline is essentially unchanged from our prior guidance. We continue to expect further sequential revenue improvement into the fourth quarter. Fluids and Engineered Systems full year organic revenue forecast had both been reduced two points. We now expect Fluids to decline 6% to 7% and Engineered Systems to be flat to 1% growth for the year. The Refrigeration and Food Equipment organic revenue has been lowered three points and now is negative one to flat. With regard to margin, we now expect adjusted margin to be around 14.1% this excludes restructuring and deal and other cost. Turning to 2016 bridge on Slide 11. Let\u2019s start with 2015 adjusted EPS of $3.63. We expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring cost in 2016 to be about $0.05. Performance including changes in volume, productivity, pricing, restructuring, benefits will impact earnings $0.73 to $0.71. This has reduced $0.38 at the midpoint from our prior forecast. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.11 to $0.09 reflecting a roughly $0.09 reduction from our prior forecast. Acquisitions less dispositions is $0.05 lower than our last forecast. Reflecting the impact of our recent acquisitions and also softer retail fueling activity. In total, net acquisitions will be about $0.07 accretive. Lastly the combined impact of interest corporate expense and the tax rate has been adjusted $0.01 from our prior forecast. In total we expect 2016 EPS to be $3 to $3.05 down about $0.38 to midpoint from our prior guidance. Approximately $0.06 of this reduction is attributable incremental fourth quarter deal and restructuring cost. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts. Bob Livingston : Thanks, Brad. As I look back over the last 18 months our results certainly haven\u2019t been up to our expectations. That being said, I don\u2019t want to lose sight of the many positive achievements our businesses have made over this time. In Energy, we effectively managed to recycle that saw a US rig count drop from 1,200 to 400 in six quarters. Through this down cycle we streamlined our business while maintaining strong service levels. We are now very well position to service our customers as activity in North America upstream markets improve. In Engineered Systems, we have expanded our Printing and Identification platform which has historically been a strong performer. Our industrial platform has also performed very well over the last few years, though facing some tough comps this year. I\u2019m excited about what we\u2019ve done in this segment especially with our recent acquisitions. Within Fluids, we have built a strong plastics and polymer. We are also in the process of building a world class retail fueling business. Our Fluids performance will improve through ongoing integrations and the addition of Wayne. Lastly, in Refrigeration and Food Equipment, we\u2019ve done a good job diversifying our customer base and growing share with several customers. While this new business has certainly put stress on manufacturing, we have executed well on customer service, quality and delivery times. As previously noted, we have added scale in several markets where we see strong growth potential. In addition, we\u2019ve further focused our business by divesting non-core assets. In all, our recent acquisitions combined with Wayne will add over $700 million in revenue next year. These deals together with a continuing recovery in upstream oil and gas markets and our commitment to improve margins give me confidence we are on the right path. With that, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. Now Paul let\u2019s take some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks, Bob. As a reminder, we have lots of people in queue so I\u2019d like to remind you - please you get one question with one follow-up and with that, Paula if we can have the first question. Operator : Your first question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays Scott Davis : I\u2019m trying to get sense, I struggle sometimes the model you guys - because when things come back it\u2019s going to be probably pretty darn good. But when Energy comes back is the incremental margin and I\u2019m talking more on upstream stuff. Is the incremental margin higher in 2017 than it was in kind of the good years as to say three years ago or is it lower? And I guess the reason why I\u2019m asking this question is that, does the restructuring mean that you get a higher incremental margin or does that get offset by weaker price? Bob Livingston : Well I would start first by saying I don\u2019t - with everything we\u2019re looking at with respect to our planning for 2017, we are not assuming that we are going to have price increases. Scott Davis : Yes, I\u2019m just talking about - did the decreases hurt you, I mean I would assume prices are going to be down in their backlog, right? Bob Livingston : Yes, we don\u2019t see further price degradation in 2017, Scott but we surely are not planning on price increases. But to the heart of your question with respect to the incremental margins in a recovery phase. I would say in the early months of the recovery let\u2019s say at least the first six months, we are going to be quite diligent and not adding any cost unless they\u2019re absolutely required to service the customer. So I think as we see, a 10%, 15%, maybe even up to a 20% increase in volume. We will not be adding the cost base back like we would have had in 2014. I think as you get behind the flex point of the manufacturing capability and you\u2019ll see us adding some cost. But I think in the first few months of the recovery you\u2019ll see incremental margins that will be quite attractive. Scott Davis : Yes, okay that\u2019s helpful and then, I know there\u2019s lots of questions so I want to ask quick follow-up on Hillphoenix. What does production inefficiencies really mean? I mean in my world it means volumes are light, you didn\u2019t control cost, but does it mean something different, to you guys? Bob Livingston : Well no, actually volumes aren\u2019t light, Scott. In fact I was pretty pleased with the bookings at Hillphoenix in the third quarter and I will tell you that maybe I\u2019m being a bit cautious here but the booking, the order rates, the booking rates here in October are coming at a bit stronger than we had anticipated for a normal fourth quarter order run rate. Brad Cerepak : Seasonally strong. Bob Livingston : Seasonally strong. So the production inefficiencies have nothing to do with the reduced volume. It\u2019s actually the complexity that we\u2019ve added into the organization with many new customers and smaller product box and I would tell you sort of the fixes and changes that we\u2019re making sort of fall into two key areas. One is little bit better integrity around our comp [ph] bond releases and a little bit better integrity around holding our production schedules once they\u2019re released and that\u2019s been a challenge for the team over the last three or four months. The guide we have in the fourth quarter. I would like to believe I\u2019m being cautious with this guide with not only the segment but specifically with Hillphoenix, that our guide for the fourth quarter does not assume any further improvements in our production variances beyond what we were running at in September. That said, we continue to work every week, every day to improve the manufacturing flow at Hillphoenix. You want to add anything to that, Brad? Brad Cerepak : No, I would just say that\u2019s a view versus our expectations and year-over-year the team continues to make progress. I mean I would say the added piece I would say is that the production through the facility year-over-year is not abnormal. And what I mean by that is that, the production cost seem to be fairly in line it\u2019s where our expectations are much higher for further productivity. Bob Livingston : I\u2019ll give you a number. We measure this with respect to their production variances. The cost for us in the third quarter for these production variances at Hillphoenix was $6 million. Scott Davis : Okay. Bob Livingston : It\u2019s a significant number. Scott Davis : Great answer. Okay, thank you guys. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Winoker, Bernstein. Steve Winoker : I want to stick on Hillphoenix for a while. I have been known that business for more than 15 years and they were one of the few folks who were able to make money in this industry, when so many others were bleeding and a lot of that was the magic of the whole business model and you\u2019re talking, I know as you\u2019re making everything more complex or sorry as the customer mix is becoming more complex that is one of the problems that the old guys always had before you took over one of them and others struggle. So is this more than just a small manufacturing fix but rather a whole design for manufacturability and broader fix. I mean I\u2019m just a little more concerned of what I\u2019m hearing. Bob Livingston : Longer term, we\u2019re looking at I would label it as product design opportunities but that\u2019s not impacting our product flow today. It is just unbelievable how much the, I call it the mix complexity has changed at Hillphoenix over the last six and nine months and as we hit the seasonal ramp period here in late second quarter and in the third quarter that complexity really did hammer us, Steve. Steve Winoker : Okay, all right well we can maybe dive in later. But and then just on that point, you mentioned $6 million production. Bob Livingston : And by the way when you Hillphoenix has always made money, look we\u2019re still making money, which is not to our expectations. I\u2019m not just saying my expectations we\u2019re not operating at Hillphoenix\u2019s expectations. Steve Winoker : Okay, fair enough and just so I\u2019m clear that production variance of $6 million. Is there any way to sort of give us the thought for how much of, I don\u2019t know the year-on-year negative impact came out of these inefficiencies? Bob Livingston : Well let\u2019s see, I think Brad you shared a comment that margins were down 130 or 140 basis points. Actually I think if you do the math, maybe 120 of the 140 decrease was the $6 million of production variances. Am I close on that number? Brad Cerepak : Yes. Bob Livingston : In the third quarter and we\u2019re talking third quarter year-over-year. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Steve Winoker : Okay, I think I used my follow-up question. So I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : So just not to [indiscernible] this too much but just one last question on Refrigeration and Food Equipment. When do you think this gets rectified and does your new production design allow you to then potentially stem share loss and potentially even gain share. So how are you guys thinking about that? Bob Livingston : Well, your comment about share loss I would say that one is behind us because you\u2019re referring to the loss of the business at Walmart. Joe Ritchie : Yes, I just look at your trends. I\u2019m sorry. Bob Livingston : Yes, go ahead. Joe Ritchie : No, I was just going to say I was just looking at your trends in the most recent quarters and I think they\u2019ve been flat to down depending on which sub-segment we look at and it looks like you\u2019re continuing to lose share in certain pieces of your business and so I\u2019m just curious whether this allows you to potentially stem some of that? Bob Livingston : Okay and this is a question specific to Hillphoenix. Joe Ritchie : Correct. Bob Livingston : Okay, I will tell you that aside from the Walmart global bid that we lost the chunk of business and we have not lost share with other customers, we\u2019ve been gaining share. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Brad Cerepak : Keep in mind we do have a disposition in there that you have to take out when you do your comparisons. Joe Ritchie : Fair enough. Bob Livingston : [Indiscernible] business was divested in the fourth quarter of last year and if I remember correctly, I think. Brad Cerepak : [Indiscernible]. Bob Livingston : We can say $85 million to $90 million in sales. Joe Ritchie : Got it, but I guess in terms of maybe the initial question was, when does it get rectified so maybe some thoughts there? Bob Livingston : Again, you\u2019re asking a question about the Walmart business. Joe Ritchie : I\u2019m talking more about the production inefficiencies that contributed to the margin that you. Bob Livingston : I think you\u2019ll see us having the two key areas that I\u2019ve mentioned here around the integrity of the comp [ph] bond releases and the integrity of the holding the production schedule. I think you\u2019ll see us have that completed here in the three or four months. Joe Ritchie : Got it and then maybe coming off of refrigeration and food equipment for a second and talking about fluids. If I take a look at the organic orders over the last few quarters they\u2019ve continued to deteriorate. I guess at what stage do you think that this reverses clearly Wayne closes will help you from a growth perspective, but I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re feeling about 2017 from organic standpoint, where we stand this year? Bob Livingston : Look the biggest year-over-year decline within fluids that we\u2019ve experienced has been in the applications and the businesses that are either in the upstream or the midstream oil and gas markets. And when I shared that comment I\u2019m including what we would label internally as our transportation activity around railcar, tank cars as well as terminal loading arms. And the bulk of that decline has been in North America, that decline has been fairly significant. I think year-over-year if I rolled all of that together it\u2019s probably down about 23%, 25% and it\u2019s about this oil and gas exposure is about 22%, 23% of the segment when I include transportation. We\u2019re not expecting any recovery in the fourth quarter that I can tell you. I think the outlook for 2017 in this part of the business is going to be dependent upon further recoveries in the upstream oil and gas market and I think we\u2019ll have a better feel for that as we move through the fourth quarter. Joe Ritchie : Got you. I\u2019ll get back in queue, thanks guys. Bob Livingston : We will provide our outlook and some detail in this part of the business at our investor dinner in December. Joe Ritchie : Okay, good enough. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Maybe just a little more color on Fluids in terms of the Fluids transfer business. You know I think Joe asked about, it did weaken this quarter versus last quarter a little bit more that particular business. You guys have mentioned big integrated not spending in the past you mentioned Canadian OPW\u2019s weakness and then of course Tokheim you were setting some improvement in the second half of the year. It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s materialized as much as you thought, so maybe you can talk about the pieces of fluid transfer. Bob Livingston : Okay, so across the board within fluid transfer. No actually I don\u2019t want to say across the board because in the couple of our businesses that deal with hygienic and pharma markets, their order activity and business activity is up actually quite strong. I think its high single digits 8% or 9%. The bulk of the headwinds that we have experienced this year and again I\u2019m repeating myself from Joe\u2019s question have been in the upstream and midstream oil related markets. The North American retailing fueling market and this is not Tokheim, this is now OPW we\u2019ve had growth in North America but it\u2019s been less than we expected and I think third quarter growth year-over-year for North America retail fueling this is the OPW legacy business. I think was 6%. That said, North Canada was significantly lower than we expected and it ended up being a decline in spending the customers or from customers in Canada. Tokheim, I think we\u2019re probably going to end the year. The second half will come in fairly close to our expectations of Tokheim that we had in July but we do see some changes. Middle East is softer than we were looking at three months ago. China has degraded a bit but not much. I\u2019m talking a $1 million or $2 million but it hasn\u2019t changed that much since the July call and absent my comment or excluding my comment on the Middle East. European activity has had growth with Tokheim during the second half. Do you want to add anything? Brad Cerepak : Yes, I would interject on there. I think from our last views on Tokheim we probably see a softer sales number now for the year of about $10 million to $15 million and it\u2019s impacting us about $0.02 in the acquisition line but as Bob said it\u2019s really more the emerging markets part of Tokheim. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay that\u2019s helpful but maybe just on \u201817. I\u2019m not asking for guidance but if you look at sort of the non-organic pieces just sort of puts and takes. You\u2019ve got lower restructuring spends in 2017, incremental restructuring savings, your auto aftermarket acquisition and Wayne potentially coming in, Tokheim more accretive given the deal cost go down there\u2019s just a lot of moving pieces. Are there any sort of advice you could give us on how to model the pieces and then it looks like competition indefinitely came down significantly this year that headwind next year. Brad Cerepak : Well there\u2019s - we\u2019ll have a lot to say about. Bob Livingston : I\u2019m glad to get the question because I told Brad we\u2019re not give guidance today. Brad Cerepak : We have a lot to say in December but you\u2019re right. I mean I would echo some of things you\u2019re saying. And we do see a lower restructuring spend next year. We expect 40 to 44 this year, we always have restructuring so not giving guidance today but it\u2019s always been put aside tough markets 15 to 20. Bob Livingston : 15 to 20, yes. Brad Cerepak : So that will be lower, we have carryover benefits on restructuring which will take us into 2017 my rough number would say that\u2019s about $30 million. I think we\u2019ve said that before, we still see that as an opportunity. You\u2019re right the acquisitions will be better for us next year. We do have Wayne slipping out now best estimate its first quarter, we were hopeful to get that done this year and get some of the final expenses and not only the final expenses but I would say the early amortization step ups through the P&L and the first part of the fourth quarter here, that will now hit us in 2017. And I think there will be a lot more to talk about in terms of the integration and the synergy benefits there as we get into December, but too early really to pin point a number, we have to first close the deal. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, guys. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Just a question on fourth quarter. Seasonally Q4 is usually below Q3 and I appreciate there was some idiosyncratic things in Q3 but we\u2019re modelling Q4 in line with Q3 and I was just wondering if you could give us big buckets as to what the sequential positives are and specifically also want to understand if you sort of highlighted lower compensation and investments versus your prior guidance, how much of that is in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter? Brad Cerepak : Well I\u2019ll take the last one, first and then Bob can talk sequentially, but probably the segment would be best. You know that compensation, when you think about that investment and comp line, I would say half of it is comp, half of it is just holding back on some adds that we would have normally have done this time of year going into next year. And I would say it\u2019s 50-50 split between the third and the fourth, we trueup [ph] comp accruals every quarter and so year-to-date updated that during the third quarter and you\u2019ll see a little bit of that coming through in the fourth on that comp line. As far as. Bob Livingston : Okay with respect to sequential trends third to fourth. We expect Energy to be up a bit on the top line more than that improvement on the bottom line. We expect Fluids to continue to have growth sequentially into the fourth quarter and. Brad Cerepak : 4%. Bob Livingston : Yes and I would tell you that the bulk of not all of it, but a significant chunk of it maybe 60% of the growth we\u2019re seeing in fluids from the third to the fourth is retail fueling. Brad Cerepak : We have growth in MOG [ph] pump too. Bob Livingston : And MOG [ph] pump. DES will be up, but I would say that\u2019s probably all related to the acquisition, I think organically, DES is probably flat. We\u2019ll see continued growth in our product ID platform and maybe very modest decline organically in our industrial platform and refrigeration segment is down but it always is, it\u2019s seasonally down. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question. You made comments on broad sort of industrial weakness and I appreciate you\u2019ve given some color. At the same time if you look at the Product ID, those short cycle more consumer driven businesses seem to be doing well, just from a 40,000 foot view what\u2019s happening in the economy because it seems a lot of other industrials have had weak second half of September. Bob Livingston : Yes, you pulled out a good example here with our Product ID business especially [indiscernible] and number one I think we commented on this a couple times earlier this year with respect to both China, what we\u2019ve seen in China over the last couple of years and in Europe and I think we\u2019re seeing it here in the states, here over the last six months or so a clear difference in customer spending of what I call OpEx items versus CapEx items and I label our market and coating business as an OpEx item. It is interesting when you look at our order trends during the third quarter what did give me some pause as we close the quarter, was September order rates were actually less than August. That\u2019s a bit unusual for us. We have really peeled that to try to understand what\u2019s going on and where we\u2019re seeing it, but and again I\u2019m going to repeat it September order rates were less than August, that\u2019s giving us a little bit. I call it pause for I guess maybe I hope what proves to be a bit of a cautious approach with respect to our fourth quarter guidance. If I were to share with you some early reads here in October. October order trends are actually a little bit better than we expected. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. Bob Livingston : And that\u2019s across the board. I would tell you something else we started to see here in the second quarter or in the third quarter. Not only with orders that were in our backlog but with new orders, we can pretty easily circle about $50 million of revenue that was expected to ship either in the third quarter or the fourth quarter where customers have pushed it out to 2017. It\u2019s not anything significant with any individual business but collectively the number surprise me. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from J.P. Morgan Steve Tusa : So just wanted to make sure I got the fluid. You said revenue is up 4% sequentially in 4Q and so I guess is ultimately and I\u2019m not sure what base you were talking about with Tokheim, but what\u2019s the actual revenue number you\u2019re thinking about with Tokheim, this year? Bob Livingston : I don\u2019t have it with me, Brad. Steve Tusa : Well you said, you tweaked it by $10 million to $15 million, so it\u2019s kind of specific comment, that\u2019s all. Bob Livingston : Yes, but you asked me for total number and I don\u2019t have that here with me right now. Brad Cerepak : Yes, well it\u2019s going to be Steve around $230 million to $240 million. It\u2019s down significantly due to the emerging markets mainly China as we talked about before. Sequentially Tokheim had second quarter into third quarter 13% growth rate, this is the seasonality of that business and we see that continuing into the fourth quarter with about 10% sequentially on Tokheim specifically 4%. Bob Livingston : For the segment. Brad Cerepak : For the segment, that\u2019s on the strength of some tenders we won, we\u2019ll see them ship in the fourth quarter into 2017 by the way. So 2017 in Tokheim I think will have better comps, a better opportunity for us. Steve Tusa : Okay and then just a quick follow-up by, that\u2019s great color by the way on the fourth quarter. On refrigeration and food, your margins have kind of they treaded [ph] down this quarter, they were down even adding back their production inefficiencies, I mean will you be able to grow margins at this business in the fourth quarter and also, has Kroger gotten into you guys as far as giving you any indication of what they\u2019re going to spend in 2017 or does that come kind of later in the year? Bob Livingston : We have an indication, but we don\u2019t get enough, I call it specifics until a little bit later in the year. And help me with the number. We did see within the Hillphoenix backlog, I think about a $1 million worth of orders and maybe it may have been bit less but there was something, it wasn\u2019t a bit number but we did see it. Steve Tusa : How big is Kroger now for you guys, are they almost as big as Walmart? Bob Livingston : No. Steve Tusa : Okay. Bob Livingston : A third. Steve Tusa : And then just quickly 4Q margins for refrigeration directionally because they were down but they were up in the first quarter, so just curious is to how you kind of play that out as you run through these production inefficiencies. Brad Cerepak : Fourth quarter margins are little bit better. Steve Tusa : Year-over-year? Brad Cerepak : Yes. Steve Tusa : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : A couple things, just on oil back to energy specifically. Just a couple pieces of color I\u2019m looking for. First you commented about long cycle weakness. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s a comment away from the drilling and production numbers in the bearings and compression, can you just elaborate on that first. Bob Livingston : Well let me, give you a perhaps a better definition of what I refer to when I say our early cycle applications and it really is drilling and artificial lift, Jeff. When I label our early cycle applications, our longer cycle applications yes is bearings and compression as well as our wench business. Jeffrey Sprague : So are you seeing further downward pressure specifically in the gas driven market? Bob Livingston : This is not deteriorated since the second quarter. And our bearings and compression business and third and fourth quarter, we actually see a very, very modest. In fact it\u2019s so modest, you have to call it flat. Flat performance from the third to the fourth and our bearings and compression business and slightly improved margins. Jeffrey Sprague : And then back to the early cycle stuff on the drilling and production side, what are you seeing now on production, completion specifically, is there an uptick in completion activity with kind of wells here with, kind of five handle any real inflection in those two there? Bob Livingston : Yes, there was an increase in activity in the third quarter on the completion of wells. Let me give you a data point here at comp. so if I look at rig count, second quarter to third quarter and my number is going to be the poorly average from second quarter to third quarter. The rig count was up I think 14% and in our early cycle applications around drilling and artificial lift combined, the growth in that part of the business was almost identical to the increase in the rig count. It correlated very, very well, Jeff. We would expect that correlation to hold true for October and November as well. We\u2019re being a bit cautious here in our outlook for energy with respect to the month of December. We have some concerns that we are going to see something similar to last year, when customers went really quite for the last two weeks of December and in fact many of our customers actually did not take product delivery at all through the final two weeks of the year. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to see that same phenomenon again this year, but we do expect a little bit of slowing in activity in December and it\u2019s not connected to rig count per se, it\u2019s just connected to customer spending and I call it balance sheet management. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes, I would have guessed and correct me if I\u2019m wrong but what you said there about you\u2019re up 14 tracking to rig count up 14 implies I guess no net draw down on ducts [ph] in the quarter and I guess I would have thought that in my cap. Bob Livingston : Okay, there was a net draw down, I don\u2019t have a number but I think it was significant relative to what we\u2019ve seen over the last three or four quarters. I think, the net draw - and we haven\u2019t seen the final data on that. But I think the net draw down on ducts [ph] in the third quarter could be approaching a 1,000 wells. You have to appreciate that 20%, 22% better than 20% I think it maybe 22% or 23% of our artificial lift business is outside of North America and that especially in the Middle East and Latin America in the third quarter, we actually saw, I think a small single-digit decline year-over-year in our non-North American business and our US artificial lift business the, it was a little bit better than the rig count increase. Jeffrey Sprague : And just finally I\u2019m sorry, if I could sneak one in, you gave us in the bridge kind of the fuel cost impact in Fluids, but can you give us the sense of what the overall mix effects of all the M&A is in Fluids, if you can parse that down to kind of almost the same store sales basis on the core underlying Fluids. Brad Cerepak : You want core margins, Jeff? Bob Livingston : Do you want core margins? Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. Bob Livingston : So let\u2019s see, we had a. Brad Cerepak : Core margins, ex-acquisitions. Bob Livingston : Ex- acquisitions and deal cost 20%. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Yes, we caught a lot of grounds so couple of clean ups from me. So just going back to Andrew\u2019s question about the sort of 30,000 foot macro view, what you hearing from customers? I mean, are we seeing budgets to third or budget cuts or is there some softening in the solution channels, where we are seeing some inventory headwinds, I mean any color there will be very helpful. Bob Livingston : It depends, I think it somewhat depended upon the sector. I think what we continue to see in our longer cycle, oil and gas applications is continuing budget cuts and I\u2019m not so sure that the customers are actually cutting their CapEx budgets but are being reallocated. We are convinced that\u2019s happening a little bit here in North America with respect to the EMV rollout, even though we in our OPW legacy business have shown organic growth year-to-date and we\u2019ll show it for the year. It is less than expected and we are rather certain that part of that reduction is being diverted to the EMV rollout. So they\u2019re not necessarily cutting their budgets but reallocating where some of the CapEx spending is going. In the industrial that one\u2019s a tougher one to call, Nigel. The orders do seem to be closing a bit longer, the cycle is a bit longer and as I mentioned earlier the push outs that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of months, I made the comment to Brad just recently, we\u2019d go back several years before we would find a quarter really saw that level of push out activity. Nigel Coe : Yes, that\u2019s the [indiscernible] of my question. I\u2019m just trying to figure out what caused that to happen this quarter as oppose to maybe first half of the year. Yes, okay. Bob Livingston : I\u2019m not sure, I can answer that question. I can tell you that it\u2019s rather evident right now. Nigel Coe : Okay, great and then just on the fluids margins. You know in previous calls you call out the impact of acquisitions it\u2019s obviously lot of noise in that number. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can give us. Bob Livingston : Let me maybe correct that, when we say ex-acquisition and deal cost, maybe that number is also ex-restructuring. It\u2019s all out, its ex-restructuring acquisitions and deal cost. Brad Cerepak : So it really is the core margin of the continuing business of fluids. Nigel Coe : And sorry, what was that core margin again, Brad? Brad Cerepak : 20%. Nigel Coe : 20%, okay that\u2019s helpful. Brad Cerepak : In the quarter, yes. Nigel Coe : Right, and then just a quick one on the Energy, you know the comments in your prepared remarks seems to point us to minus 26% or there are about on your full year guide, but then you commented about the December caution. So the reason for the range on energy, the wide range of energy would be because of the December caution perhaps. Bob Livingston : Yes. Nigel Coe : Great, thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC. Deane Dray : One of the changes that people are talking about in retail refrigeration is the recent announcement that Amazon is planning to move into grocery stores and so what might the prospects be for Hillphoenix this new customer, what the timing might be and are you in discussions with me? Bob Livingston : Amazon is a customer of Hillphoenix, we are working with them pretty closely on their distribution centers and I know that guys are having discussions on their, I call them their neighbourhood rollout program. Deane Dray : Any chance you could size for us, what an opportunity that might be and the time out? Bob Livingston : They can\u2019t even size it for us. Deane. From a timing perspective, I doubt you would see anything measurable in our business before the second half of next year and that\u2019s a guess rate now based upon what little bit we know that\u2019s been shared with us. Deane Dray : Got it and then on potential divestitures, are you still contemplating others like you did with Tipper Tie, what might the prospects be for those in timing there? Bob Livingston : So I\u2019ll turn this over to the guy, who runs M&A. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Bob. I don\u2019t want to say too much about timing on other things but as you know we\u2019ve always communicated that there are parts of the portfolio that given the right opportunity perhaps, we would love to do something once, now that\u2019s the best I could tell you at this point. Deane Dray : That\u2019s pretty vague, Brad. Brad Cerepak : I know. I\u2019m not announcing divestitures today. I\u2019m not - announcing any divestitures today. Deane Dray : Got it, thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse Julian Mitchell : Thanks for saving the best to last. Bob Livingston : We did, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Welcome. I\u2019m glad to hear it. Just on the refrigeration again, really on the top line and I guess there doesn\u2019t seem to have been much linkage so far between the year-on-year change in organic orders and the year-on-year change in organic sales, orders have been trending pretty good I think organically up about 5%. Bob Livingston : Orders have been strong, yes. Orders have been strong. Julian Mitchell : So when should that gap start to close because it sounds like Q4 again will be tough for the revenue line, is it all coming in the first half of next year although the visibility is low on that? Bob Livingston : I would say, you\u2019ll see that gap closed, maybe not all in the first quarter but it will close in the first four months. Julian Mitchell : Understood and then just within the energy business the pricing pressure I guess has been stable at around 1.8% in the last couple of quarters. Bob Livingston : [Indiscernible]. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s the good rate for next year, okay. And that should be the good rate for next year, is that what you meant by no sort of further degradation earlier on. Bob Livingston : Should not be any worse than that. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : Thank you, Paula. This concludes our conference call. With that we want to thank you once again for your continued interest in Dover and we will look forward to speaking with you again next quarter and just a reminder, our Investor Day will be in early December and we will send out invitations for that. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you that concludes today\u2019s third quarter 2016 Dover Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Overall, I was pleased with our fourth quarter business activity and results. Among the highlights in the quarter were a continuing recovery in our shorter cycle drilling and artificial lift markets, along with strong results in our printing and identification platform. We also saw solid activity in bearings and compression, as well as our Petrochemical & Polymer markets. From a geographic perspective, organic growth was mixed. Our U.S. activity excluding energy was flat year-over-year. Our European and China activity improved year-over-year and sequentially. Energy performed very well in the quarter, and modestly exceeded expectations. Revenue was up 7% sequentially, largely driven by early cycle upstream applications. Our brands and compression businesses also had a very good quarter driven by a positive customer mix. Segment margin was 10.5% and EBITDA margin returned to over 20%. Engineered Systems organic growth of 1% was driven by another strong quarter in printing and identification which had 5% growth. In the Industrial platform, organic revenue declined slightly, as activity slowed in the second half of the year at Environmental Solutions. Fluids posted 36% revenue growth, driven by acquisitions, organically, fluids was flat. Within this result, strong activity in our Petrochemical & Polymer, as well as our hygienic and pharma markets was offset by continued softness in our longer cycle oil & gas markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment revenue declined 1% organically, principally driven by tough comps in canned shaping equipment. Core margin performance was below expectations at Hillphoenix, due to product mix and production challenges in case manufacturing. I am confident of the changes we are implementing will result in improvements in this business. During the quarter, we closed Rav and Wayne, and both are off to a great start. We also closed on the sale of a business not considered core to our growth strategies. Now, looking forward. Within energy, we are encouraged by the recovery in the North American rig count and oil prices during the second half of 2016. We see strong growth in 2017 and have developed our guidance based on an average US rig count of 680 to 700 and an average WTI price of $55. Current market sentiment is a bit more bullish than our assumptions, thus our guidance may turn out to be conservative. In Engineered Systems we expect our Printing & Id platform to continue its strong record of performance, driven by increased equipment sales and very consistent consumable revenue in our marking and coding business. Also a strong contribution from RAV will complement modest but mixed organic growth in our industrial platform. Fluids strong growth will be driven by acquisitions, primarily Wayne, from which we expect a significant contribution to EPS. We also expect to see solid petrochemical and polymer, as well as hygienic and pharma markets. Our longer cycle oil and gas markets are expected to remain soft for the bulk of the year, especially within transport markets. Finally, within Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we expect solid activity in food equipment, glass doors, and specialty refrigeration cases. At this time, we expect our standard case business to be modestly down on reduced activity at a few big-box retailers. We are very focused on margin and expect it to be better as customer and product mix and manufacturing all see improvements. Order activity is showing strength early in 2017. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Brad. Brad Cerepak : That thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on slide three of our presentation deck. Today we reported fourth quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, an increase of 5%. Within this result, growth from acquisitions of 11%, more than offset an organic revenue decline of 2% and a 4% impact from dispositions and FX. EPS was $1.03, which included a disposition gain of $0.36, a product recall charge of $0.09, and discrete tax benefits of $0.05. For the full year, EPS was $3.25. The earnings bridge can be found in the appendix of our presentation deck. Segment margin for the quarter was 15.8%, adjusting for the previously mentions special items and restructuring margin was 12.8%. This result was below last year largely driven by lower organic revenue and the impact of acquisitions. Bookings increased 7% from the prior year to $1.7 billion. On an organic basis bookings declined 1%, acquisition growth of 12%, more than offset the combined impact of reduced oil and gas markets, dispositions and FX. Organic bookings in Engineered Systems grew 2%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 2%, while Fluids and Energy were down 3% and 4%, respectively. Total company book-to-bill finished at 0.98. Our overall backlog increased 8% to $1.1 billion, and on organic basis backlog declined 1%. Free cash flow was $240 million or 14% of revenue. For the full year we generated nearly $700 million of free cash flow or 10.3% of revenue. Now let's turn to slide four. Engineered Systems organic revenue increased 1%, reflecting solid growth in Printing & Identification, partially offset by soft industrial markets. Fluids organic revenue was essentially flat; Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined 1%, driven by tough comps in canned shaping equipment. Energy organic revenue was down 8%. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids and Engineered Systems at 37% and 8%, respectively. Now on slide five. Energy revenue of $293 million decrease 9%, on a sequential basis, revenue increased 7%. Earnings were $31 million and segment margin was 10.5% including restructuring costs of 1 million. These results exceeded our expectations and reflected very strong incremental margin. Bookings of $300 million were down 5% year-over-year, but more importantly showed 11% sequential improvement. These booking trends, along with continued rig count additions set us up for a strong start to the year. Book-to-bill finished at 1.02, of note December book-to-bill was 1.09. Turning to slide six, Engineered Systems revenue of $626 million was up 5% overall, included in this result is organic growth of 1% and net acquisition growth of 5%. Slightly offset by FX. Earnings of $97 million increased 8% principally reflecting a strong performance in Printing & Identification and the benefits of productivity. Our Printing & Identification platform revenue of $268 million increased 4%. Organic revenue was up 5% reflecting solid global marketing coating markets and strong digital printing equipment activity. In the industrial platform, revenue increased 5% to $374 million. This result included net acquisition growth of 7%, and an organic decline of 1%. The organic decline reflected slower activity at Environmental Solutions. Margin was 15.5%, a 60 basis point improvement, primarily reflecting the benefits of productivity programs. Excluding acquisitions, margin was 17.3%, up 220 basis points on a comparative basis. Bookings of $643 million were up 6% overall, including organic bookings growth of 2% and growth from net acquisitions of 5%. Organically, Printing & Identification grew 8%, while Industrials declined 2%. Book-to-bill for Printing & Identification was 1.01, industrial book-to-bill was 1.04. Overall our book-to-bill was 1.03. Now let's move to slide seven. Fluids revenue increased 36% to $483 million. Revenue performance reflects 37% growth from acquisitions, partially offset by a 1% FX impact. Organic growth was essentially flat. This result primarily reflects strong shipments to Petrochemical & Polymer customers, and continued strong results in pharma and hygienic markets, offset by weak longer cycle oil & gas markets, especially in transport. Earnings decreased 44% to $35 million, excluding the product recall charge and restructuring, earnings improved modestly. Margin in the quarter was 7.2%, excluding the product recall charge and restructuring, margin was 13.6%. Of note, core margin remained very solid at over 18%, which further adjust for the impact of acquisitions and related deal costs. Bookings were 457 million, an increase of 42%. This result principally reflects the impact of acquisitions. On an organic basis, bookings declined 3%. Book-to-bill was 0.95. Now let's turn to slide eight. Refrigeration & Food Equipment\u2019s revenue of $376 million included an organic revenue decline of 1%. The revenue decline was largely driven by project timing in our can shaping business. Earnings of $118 million included a disposition gain of $85 million. Adjusting for this gain and restructuring, earnings were $34 million down 30% from the prior year, and adjusted margin was 9%. Production and efficiencies of about $7 million at Hillphoenix accounted for the majority of this decline. Bookings of $337 million decreased 2% organically, principally reflecting soft order activity by a few big-box retailers. Book-to-bill was 0.89. Let's move on to the overview on slide nine. Let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense was $32 million, higher than our forecast and includes a settlement of approximately $3 million. Net interest expense was $33 million, largely in line with expectations. Our fourth quarter tax rate was 25.4%, CapEx was $49 million in the quarter. Moving on to slide 10, which shows are 2017 guidance. To start, let me say our revenue guidance is unchanged from the forecast we shared at our investor meeting just two weeks ago. We expect total revenue to increase 10% to 12% including organic revenue growth of 3% to 5%. We also expect acquisitions will add approximately 10% growth, partially offset by completed dispositions and FX. From a segment perspective, energy is expected to grow 13% to 16% organically, driven by improving upstream and North American oil and gas fundamentals. Engineered Systems organic growth is anticipated to be 1% to 3% driven by very solid printing and identification markets. We expect both fluids and refrigeration of Food Equipment to post flat to 2% organic growth. Corporate expense is anticipated to be around $125 million, up about $12 million over last year, reflecting a comp reset and planned investments as we further implement Dover business services across the company. Net interest expense is up modestly over 2016 on the funding of the Wayne deal. We forecast the full-year normalized tax rate to be about 28%, CapEx should be around 2.4% of revenue and we expect to generate free cash flow at 11% of revenue. Lastly, we expect segment margin to be around 13.7% at the midpoint of our guidance.  Turning to the 2017 bridge, on slide 11. Let's start with 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.85. We expect the year-over-year impact of lower restructuring costs in 2017 to be $0.08 to $0.10. Performance, including changes in volume, productivity pricing and restructuring benefits will add $0.81 to $0.95 to earnings. Increases in investment and compensation will impact earnings $0.15 to $0.13. Growth investments comprise about two-thirds of this total. Lastly, the combined impact of interest, corporate expense and the tax rate will be a $0.19 to $0.17 headwind. In total, we expected 2017 EPS to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60. At the midpoint of our guidance, this represents a 23% increase over the adjusted prior year. With that, let me turn the call back over to Bob. Bob Livingston : Thanks, Brad. I am very optimistic about 2017, and believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities in front of us. Within Energy, we see improving US oil and gas markets driving growth in our drilling, artificial lift, and automation businesses, which represent about two-thirds of this segment revenue. For this segment, we are expecting strong organic growth in 2017. Within Engineered Systems we see adoption rates of digital printing continuing to grow, and our marketing and coding business, marketing conditions remained favorable and we expect continued strong execution. Additionally, our recent RAV acquisition will be a significant contributor to growth and we are excited to become an even stronger partner with our customers in the global vehicle service markets. We also expect our core industrial businesses to post modest organic growth. In Fluids, 2017 strong growth will be driven by recent acquisitions, most notably Wayne, we have a great management team in place who are fully focused on the EMB opportunity, and capturing significant synergies. Modest organic growth will largely be driven by strong hygienic and pharma markets and improved customer activity in our petrochemical and polymer and industrial markets. Lastly, in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, recent strong bookings and can shaping equipment has set Food Equipment up for an improved 2017. We also expect another solid year for glass doors and specialty refrigeration cases, also encouraging is the fact that we are well booked in refrigeration cases for the first quarter. And, I fully expect margin to expand in the second half of the year, as our improvement initiatives take hold. As we begin the year, our markets are largely constructive, and I am confident we will execute well and deliver on our 2017 plans. In closing, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. Now, Paul, we will take some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks. Before we open up the line to questions, I just again like to remind you as a courtesy if you can ask one question with a follow-up, will be able to get more questions and we have over 20 people in queue. So with that, Kristine, let's take the first question. Operator : Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Jeff. Brad Cerepak : Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : I've got two unrelated questions, if you can take them. First, just on Wayne itself, Bob, now that you've got it closed. Can you just share a little bit kind of \u2013 it's performance here the last three to six months, the trends in the business into the close, so to speak, and is there any kind of overhang or anything to be thinking about in the first half as you digested? Bob Livingston : So there \u2013 Jeff, I'll give you a comment on the second half of '16 because that's really when we started tracking their performance on a fairly close basis. As we have communicated and as we expected, the retail fuel and market does build quarter-to-quarter sequentially through the year. We saw that happen at Wayne. I would say for the second half of the year, revenue plan they were perhaps \u2013 they perhaps lately exceeded it, they actually had a strong \u2013 a pretty solid and strong December, our first month of ownership with them. So we were quite pleased with the performance of the business in the second half of the year. I'll actually share this with you for those who may be interested if you are trying to fill out your models. I think the revenue we booked under what the 3 or 3.5 weeks of ownership in December, Jeff, I think it was approaching $50 million. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. Great. Bob Livingston : Very strong margin, but you know, dilutive to the results of Dover because of \u2013 to your question on overhang, we had some expenses and cost in the fourth quarter. But, Jeff, as we go forward, we are going to continue to see charges through the P&L related to Wayne and capturing the synergy benefits. I would say, those amount to about $9 million to $10 million or so in 2017 and not having all the date in front of me, I'd say they're pretty evenly spread. I don't see any big impacts sort of the first quarter on Wayne related to synergy costs. Jeffrey Sprague : We, obviously, don't have any idea of like how - what Wayne's plan look like versus history or anything. But would you characterize the performance as up versus 2015? Do you have visibility\u2026 Bob Livingston : No. We actually do have, I don't have the exact data. But I do know that it was up in '16 over '15, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. Thanks. Could you just quickly and I'll get off on price for Energy, I think you said you weren't planning it and Baker out there this morning saying that people are begging for prices to be held flat so to speak. Do think there will be upward pressure on price for you, price realization? Is that starting to happen in your business yet? Bob Livingston : Upward pressure on price, you are asking if the customers are going to encourage us to raise our prices? I don't think that's going to happen. Jeffrey Sprague : No, are you going despite the discouragement raised it anyhow? Bob Livingston : I - you could actually see that very, let\u2019s say, very judiciously in the second half of the year. I would not expect to see anything of note to occur in the first half of the year, Jeff\u2026 Brad Cerepak : And we are not planning\u2026 Bob Livingston : And we're not planning on any price increases at all for 2017. I will point out that we did end 2016 on a price down number of - I think it ended up right at 2% of revenue for the segment, Brad, am I correct? Brad Cerepak : Correct. Bob Livingston : For Energy, which is what we had been guiding all year in. So I feel comfortable with, I call it, the pricing part of the Energy plan for 2017 and maybe we see a little bit of lift in the second half, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Thank you very much. Bob Livingston : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Good morning, guys. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Shannon. Brad Cerepak : Good morning, Shannon. Shannon O'Callaghan: Bob, maybe put a little more context on the comment that the energy markets are little more optimistic than what you've baked in. I mean you talked about the 1.09 book-to-bill in December. Maybe just a little context on where that stands versus what you would normally see it end of December. And also the bearings and compression business in there actually turned this quarter too, I mean, is that going to continue or is that kind of a one-off? Bob Livingston : Okay. So let me give answer to the questions, it\u2019s probably a shorter response on bearings and compression. The folks there had an outstanding fourth quarter. But I would also tell you it was just about as expected. We had some project shipment scheduled for the fourth quarter. The team did a great job of executing. They delivered good margins on that, but it was some project activity, Shannon. We looked into 2017 for bearings and compression. We've got modest organic growth in bearings and compression. It is a bit lumpy. We're not going to see sequential growth in B&C from the fourth quarter to the first quarter simply because of the strong project shipments in the fourth quarter, but we will see growth in 2017. Comment on the \u2013 let's call it the upstream activity. Look, the headline number we all watch, right, actually I would say two headline numbers that we watch and we one of them we can see weekly is rig count deployment, and so we all know what the trend line has been. The \u2013 we were \u2013 nobody was more pleased to see the rig count increase that was posted last week. I think it was 35 or 37 units, Brad, 35? Brad Cerepak : Yeah. Bob Livingston : So, as we start here in January, maybe our rig count assumption is a bit conservative. That said, Shannon, don't look at rig count as being the leading indicator for the entire segment. It is a very, very good indicator for our drilling activity and, in fact, I would tell you that in 2016. Our drilling activity increased perhaps even a little bit stronger than we saw in the rate of change with respect to rig count in the second half of the year. I think some of that was a little bit of restocking. But in 2017, I would expect our drilling activity to pretty highly correlate with the rig count that's not quite true with automation and artificial lift. The significant increase in CapEx spending that we've seen with customers in the second half of 2016, and I suspect the lion's share of some of the increase CapEx spending that we'll see in the first \u2013 at least in the first quarter of 2017 is highly weighted to drilling. We are seeing increases in well completions. But it is not nearly at the rate that we\u2019re seeing with rig count increases. We do expect well completion activity to pick up during the year but the rate of change in the first half \u2013 second half of last year was nowhere near the rate of change we saw in rig count. I hope that gives you some color. Shannon O'Callaghan: Yeah. That's great Bob, thanks. And just one quick follow-up on the sequential margin there it was very strong leverage sequentially even adjusting for restructuring 3Q to 4Q. Anything in particular, I mean other than was that mainly the fact that the drilling business had a strong quarter or were there any other positive mix factors to consider in for Q4 for Energy? Bob Livingston : Well, you're right about the drilling \u2013 our drilling business having a very strong fourth quarter, but again I'll give a shot out to the guys at bearings and compression. The revenue increased sequentially from the third quarter to fourth quarter and delivered pretty good margins on that business. Brad Cerepak : Yes, of course the board in Energy they were sequentially up as you know, and the margin conversion was quite good. In fact, going into 2017, sequentially, we would expect very strong margin conversion and year-over-year margin conversion in Energy in excess of 40%. Shannon O'Callaghan: Great. Thanks, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. This is Andrew Caddell [ph] for Deane. Once that you give some more color on the declines you've been seeing in Environmental Solutions and I think how long you expect this to persist and what might be in guidance? Bob Livingston : Okay. So the second half \u2013 I'm not sure I can separate the fourth quarter from the second half on that. The second half activity was probably down \u2013 gosh it could have been as much as 5% or 6% versus the first half of 2016 just within Environmental Solutions and we actually weren\u2019t expecting that. We were expecting a little bit of a falloff in the fourth quarter, but as we came into the second half of year we weren't expecting that falloff in the third quarter. We see the softness continuing in Environmental Solutions through the first quarter. We think by the time we get to mid part of the second quarter that the customer buying activity returns and we'll see a much stronger revenue and earnings progression in that business and our guide reflects that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And is there a specific vertical that\u2019s causing this ongoing kind of weakness? Bob Livingston : No. This is a fairly defined vertical. It\u2019s [indiscernible]\u2026 Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, can you update us I think on Energy there's a pretty steep margin kind of improvement as the year progressed and just want to see if that's on track as you kind of round out January? Bob Livingston : Well, I don't have January closed yet, but the order rates not just in Energy, I would say this for all that's on the call. The order rates here in January, in general, largely across Dover are coming in a little bit stronger than we had anticipated for January. And specific \u2013 your specific question about conversion in Energy, I think Brad answered that a few minutes ago. We\u2019re expecting fairly healthy incremental margins in energy, a little bit better than 40% and we feel pretty confident with that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just I'll ask question energy, I apologize. Can you comment on exit margins in December? Bob Livingston : Okay. Andrew Obin : Relative to what you've\u2026 Bob Livingston : I'm going to take a guess, I know Brad is going to correct me. But I think our operating margins and this would've been no adjustments, whatever restructuring charges we had in December would've been included in this. But I think our operating margins in December were like 11.1%. They were little bit better than 11%. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Bob Livingston : Okay. Andrew Obin : And that's with adjustments? Bob Livingston : I'm sorry. Repeat that. Andrew Obin : That was with the adjustments. Bob Livingston : If there were any. Andrew Obin : Okay. Bob Livingston : If there were any restructuring charges, the margin I'm giving you includes those restructuring charges. I just don't recall what the restructuring charges were in the month. Brad Cerepak : Yes. In the month. Andrew Obin : Appreciate it. Bob Livingston : We had a $1 million for the quarter. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just to follow up on Wayne, could you just talk what it is you are seeing in the channel in terms of larger customers putting full retrofits versus readers? What are you hearing, because we are sort of hearing conflicting messages from the channel? On one hand you have sort of big brands encouraging their retailers to do a full upgrade at the same time you do have the allegation of the cycle. Bob Livingston : Well, I'm not sure that we are hearing much different from that. It does vary from customer to customer and I'm referring to you said specifically to larger accounts. It's going to be a bit different. But as a general statement, I think what we are generally hearing is that, if the dispenser is eight years or older. The dispenser on, if it's been in the field eight years or longer, I think the operators are being given strong encouragement by the brand owner to replace the dispenser in its entirety. If it's less than eight years, then we're seeing - we are simply seeing the retro - the up fit or the upgrade being sold. Andrew Obin : And what\u2026 Bob Livingston : I'm not so sure, I don't think that's much different than what we've been hearing over the last three or four months either. Andrew Obin : Got you. And what share of the install base is eight years or older? Bob Livingston : Pardon? Andrew Obin : What share of the install basis eight year\u2026 Bob Livingston : I don't have that data. Andrew Obin : I\u2019ll take it offline. Thank you so much. Bob Livingston : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Thanks and good morning, all. Bob Livingston : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning, Steve. Steven Winoker : Hey, just like to start some of the peer companies have talked about customer pull-through and budget flushes at the end of \u2013 through December. Maybe outside of Energy, which you covered pretty well in your other businesses. Did you see any signs, evidence, discussion where that that might be happening? Bob Livingston : No. I mean, we had strong order rates in December, but I wouldn't \u2013 I don't think we \u2013 that's just not part of our portfolio make a. That's \u2013 we don't think we see that. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then on margins, both in Fluids and Refrigeration, and Hillphoenix, outside of the one timers, obviously, still \u2013 obviously we have productivity issues and refrigeration. But maybe talk about just some of the activities there from an operational basis, from a supply chain planned basis to what extent do you think you'll start to see better leverage incremental\u2019s performance? Bob Livingston : Okay. So I think we may have shared this, maybe on our October call. I think I shared with you that our \u2013 I told that our production variances within Hillphoenix that we sort of took it on the chin was in the third quarter were about $7 million. Okay. And I think, in the fourth quarter it was a little less but it wasn't, I mean, it was still, I would still say it was too high. It was enough $5 million to $6 million range. One of the key metrics and there are several, but one of the key metrics, one of the key KPI's that we managed to within this business is the production hours per case and we've been making slow and steady progress on that KPI for the last four or five months. I'd like to think the trend we're seeing here in the early part of the year here so far in January is one that we continue with, but we have seen a rather significant improvement in our KPI here in January on production hours per case. Steven Winoker : Okay. And on the\u2026 Bob Livingston : We're not \u2013 I've told you, our guide is that the second half of the year is when we're going to start to see some improvements in margins within the segment, driven by the improvement in margins within Hillphoenix, and don't expect it any sooner than that. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Steven Winoker : Okay. And how about\u2026 Bob Livingston : We'll try to deliver it sooner but don't expect it any sooner. Brad Cerepak : And maybe I can add to that a little bit. And maybe just pick up where Bob left off on our margin profile. And what I would add to that is, as we progress through the year, we see the first quarter margin really setting up lower year-over-year, given the Refrigeration and some other things including Tokheim becoming what I call core now. So I'm talking core margins, first quarter being below the prior year but then progressively improving throughout the year where we see our core margin expanding for the year, by roughly 20 basis points year-over-year, being impacted again by what we said already, by investment levels that we are making. So the progression for the year really coming off of last year is what I would say modestly down margins in the first quarter, expanding margins throughout the rest of the year. Important that's our profile\u2026. Bob Livingston : Its not just profile, so if I were to add to that, if you were \u2013 if you follow \u2013 if you look at the top end of our guide and look at the revenue number, the second half of the year is up about 250 million am I right on that? Brad Cerepak : That\u2019s right. Bob Livingston : Up about 250 million over the first half. The two Brad\u2019s comment on this, the two drivers of this is the sequential build through the year within our Energy segment and the \u2013 I call it the market profile within retail fueling, both of which we believe will be normal and ordinary in 2017. And the pressure we're going to feel in the first quarter as Brad related on margins on a year-over-year comp, it's real and we have it in our guide that way. But we will see a significant change in business results in the second quarter and a slight improvement going into the third quarter. And we'll again, because of Refrigeration we'll see what was a seasonal roll off in the fourth quarter. But I think you really need to look at our profile again, because the Energy model for this year of sequential improvements through the year and the impact at retail fueling is having on the Dover profile, I call it the quarterly waterfall, it does create a little bit different profile for Dover in 2017. Brad Cerepak : Yes. And coupled with by the way let's not forget that we had gains on dispositions in first quarter and in the\u2026 Bob Livingston : In '16. Brad Cerepak : In '16 and in the fourth quarter now. So the way I think about it first quarter 2016 was $0.52 and with margin that we're talking about we're not giving guidance for the first quarter. But I would tell you we see modest improvement off of that $0.52, and then\u2026 Bob Livingston : Not significant improvement. Brad Cerepak : Not significant, but more significant than as we progressed through the year. So hopefully that gives you an insight on our margin expectations and what's driving the top-line into more of a back half versus first half growth rate. Steven Winoker : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : So focus color there on margins. I'm little bit slow this morning, so just want to clarify maybe Brad or Bob, so you look at 1Q EPS of somewhere between 55 and 60 is that the right thing? Bob Livingston : We're not going to give guidance. Brad Cerepak : We're not going to argue with you Nigel. Nigel Coe : Nothing to argue? Okay. Bob Livingston : Okay. Well, he's not arguing by the way. Nigel Coe : So switching back to Energy, just wanted to dig into some of the two smaller segments there. Automation still down significantly and I think we all view that as a bit more of a structural grow longer-term. I'm just wondering what kind of perspective are you hearing from customers on the need or the want to automate their wealth. And typically how long into recovery is it before we see Automation spending picking up? Bob Livingston : I think we're starting to see it now, Nigel. I actually was pretty pleased with the activity we saw in the fourth quarter within automation. In fact, if I'm not mistaken, automation growth in the fourth quarter actually may have been slightly better than we saw in artificial lift. So I was really pleased with the activity in the fourth quarter. But more importantly, the question you ask is, what are the customers, how are we engaging with customers and what are they saying and we see this as being a significant opportunity for further growth, not only in 2017, but into 2018. And I like the margin profile of this business. I like the level of customer engagement we have in the business and I think you'll see us post some good growth here in 2017. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. And then, digging into bearings and compressions, a lot stronger than we'd expected, but obviously not this in your plan. Just continue to remind us, what is driving that business? Is it more of the OE turbines or specific aftermarket? And\u2026. Bob Livingston : Nigel, I would tell you in the fourth quarter, we did within - within bearings and compression, we did see one of our major OEMs return with some fairly strong demand that we were able to respond to rather quickly in the fourth quarter. We also had some other project type of business in our bearings business, in the bearings portfolio, but the significant part of that was with OE activity. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : The \u2013 we don't have all the details here from the cash flow statement, but it looks like there was you know, in the fourth quarter the net change in assets and liabilities was a pretty big number, it was like $140 million or something like that, backing out the first nine months. And anything going on there, is that just \u2013 what part of the business was that in, working capital wise or was it something else like a tax dynamic? Bob Livingston : Well, look, I think my reaction to it not having the date in front of me is that we did complete several acquisitions in the fourth quarter. You're seeing that impact on the balance sheet for sure. And so, not able to give you the date net of that or the core working capital. You have to follow up with Paul on it in a little bit more detail, but nothing fundamentally different. With respect to the core, I'd say, if anything, we saw based on the trends to the back half of the fourth quarter that our working capital grew a little bit, Steve. So we did \u2013 we were a little bit lower on our guide on free cash flow and I would say that that's on the balance sheet but it's not a big number. Brad Cerepak : The other color I'd give you, Steve, on that is December inventory build, we actually had December increase in inventory and that's pretty unusual for us. But the \u2013 it was in response to stronger order activity we saw in November and December. Our order rates built through the quarter excluding refrigeration, our order rates pretty much across the board within Dover built through the quarter, we typically don't see an inventory build in December. We experienced a little bit of that this year. Steve Tusa : Right. And I guess just another follow-up cash question on CapEx. You guys were at a relatively low level versus D&A you guys have, obviously, done a couple of big deal so there you may have enough capacity and historically your CapEx has kind of moved up with sales, it feel like it\u2019s kind of at the low end of the range right now. Would you expected that to continue to kind of inch up as a percentage of revenues over the next couple of years as we get into recovery mode or you have plenty of capacity to kind of observe any growth you see out there? Brad Cerepak : Look, I think the guide we're giving for '17 of 2.4% is that the number, Brad? 2.4% of revenue, Steve, that's a good number. Steve Tusa : Okay. Brad Cerepak : I'd almost say it's a good top end number for the next couple of years. You have to appreciate, we still have even with all the cost takeouts and Energy over the last couple of years, Steve we didn't impair assets. Steve Tusa : Right, right. Brad Cerepak : So with respect to production tooling and autoclaves and everything else, we're \u2013 we actually won't see the standard level of CapEx within the Energy business that we perhaps saw in '11, '12, '13 and '14. Steve Tusa : Okay, one last quick one on first quarter. Just kind of clarifying what the range of Nigel put out there, you had said up modestly, up modestly from the 52? I mean, 55 to 60 I'm not a math guy but that's you know\u2026 Brad Cerepak : I'm not either. Steve Tusa : That's a 10% growth rate there. So that would even seem to be a little bit more punchy than what you're talking about just to make sure everybody's level set, did you say up modestly or did you say up double-digits from that year? Brad Cerepak : I said to Nigel, I'm not going to argue with you. Steve Tusa : Okay. Okay. I guess that's the answer. Okay. Thanks a lot. Brad Cerepak : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just on the fluids business\u2026 Bob Livingston : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Pumps, I know we're short of time. So pumps had flung to a slight growth rate in Q4, you know, having been down very significantly in the preceding six months. How do you see pumps revenues playing out in 2017? Was that some sort of lumpiness in Q4 that now reverses or\u2026 Bob Livingston : So it is interesting. Good pick up on that and good question. It has been something that we have all been watching pretty closely here in the second half of the year and I will tell you, we actually started to see a turn, albeit extremely small in the third quarter. We actually had a sequentially a little bit of pick up in revenue third quarter over second quarter, and I think fourth quarter versus third quarter it was 3% or 4% improvement in our pumps revenue, so we were very pleased to see that. We're actually forecasting a little bit of growth in organic growth in our pumps business in 2017. We're not going to see it in the first quarter. We've got some \u2013 I would call it some unfavorable comps just with respect to activity against the first quarter of last year. There is a little bit of project activity that flows through this part of our portfolio. But we - for our standard pumps and we're seeing the pick up in general industrial activity, not in oil and gas, but for our standard pumps, we are continuing to see and expect some substantial improvement in standard pumps. When you put it all together, look at some of the project activity, the first quarter is going to not have a strong of a showing as we saw in the fourth quarter or that we'll see in the remaining part of 2017. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And then, my follow-up would just be on the extent of your ambitions on sort of further portfolio moves. Obviously, 2016 was extremely active, you spent about $1.6 billion on M&A, $200 million coming in from divestments. How are you thinking about 2017 in that context? Bob Livingston : A bit more modestly. We've got an active pipeline, but I will - to be quite frank, it's near-term over the next three, five, six months. There's nothing upsizing our pipeline. You may see us close on a couple or maybe even three. I would label them as smaller activities and Brad it can't even be at $100 million - all three of them are much less than $100 million. So they are small bolt-ons and add-ons. But I would also tell you, don't be surprised if you see another divestitures announcement here in the next few months. Julian Mitchell : And buybacks just sort of\u2026 Bob Livingston : The activity will be light compared to '16. Julian Mitchell : Got it. And buybacks? Bob Livingston : I think we will do our best to offset dilution this year. But beyond that, I\u2019d like to keep the capital available for growth initiatives and M&A. Julian Mitchell : Very clear. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Bob Livingston : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Bob or Brad can you talk a little bit more about the increase investment at the company and specifically within Engineered Systems? You mentioned at the Investor Day that you want to develop your products and your technology faster. Can you give some color on what specific end markets within Engineered Systems you are targeting? Are you targeting that revenue struck market and whether the focus of these end markets is going to be market share gain or maybe to offset the more difficult markets you've seen lately? Bob Livingston : So let's see, I think in our guide, Brad, we have $0.10, had $0.10 impact on EPS guide for '17 with respect to our growth investments. So let's say rough number that's about $25 million. I would say half of that is within Engineered Systems. And when I \u2013 and actually to be more specific, half of that $25 million is actually within our Printing & ID platform, and it's pretty evenly split between our marking and coding business and our digital textile business. And marking and coding, it's both, I call it some advanced and a little bit faster - I had the way I want to describe some \u2013 not so much rental product launch, let's call it some technology development that we'd like to bring on a little bit quicker than we had in our three years stat plan that we've looked at a year ago or six months ago, and some channel development. We've got a little bit more we want to do at \u2013 in our marking and coating business around channel development and so we have green lighted these investments. They'll be phased-in during the year but we have green lighted these investments. Within digital textile, two main areas for the increased incremental investment, number one is around channel mostly related to service capability development, especially in some of the emerging markets that we\u2019re now starting to sell equipment into. But the one item that's different that we're going to fund this year is a technology center or even a center, let's call it a center of excellence that's focused on more than just working with our print customers. But it's going to be set up in a way that it actually encourages and helps facilitate the owners of the label, the fashion houses, to actually allow us to get a little bit more engaged with them at an earlier point of the design cycle to also promote and push the use of our equipment. So it's about half and half but the bulk of it is in Printing & ID. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, Bob. That's helpful, and then just unrelated, can you give us a little more color on the 20 million in restructuring approximately that you're going to spend here in '17, you know, what's interesting is, if you look at '16, the $40 million you really didn't spend much at all on refrigeration. The segment margins that you said underperformed your expectations. We know you've been working hard on sort of changes to the manufacturing process that you talked about. But do you not need to spend a little more restructuring on refrigeration what are the goals in '17? Bob Livingston : Well, what you're asking about restructuring and as part of that within refrigeration. Within our retail refrigeration business, the answer is no. We may have a little bit of carryover within the segment, but it's actually not related to retail refrigeration. Do you want to provide some color? Brad Cerepak : Kind of going back to what I said before in the 20 million, the lion share of the way we think about that right now is for synergy benefits related to Tokheim and Wayne integration, I would say half of that,\u2013 I think I use the number before $9 million or $9 million to $10 million. We\u2019ll see how that develops. But that\u2019s the current thinking of half of that going into fluids. Some of the spend is also going to be in DES as we continue to do some restructuring and some of the industrial business that we have there. Like Bob said, very little, very little in terms of DRFE and then very little in terms of DE as well. So that's kind of the way we\u2019re thinking about it right now. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks, guys. Brad Cerepak : Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bob Livingston : Good morning, John. John Inch : Good morning, guys, just wanted to ask about the Tipper Tie gains. They are $0.03 higher than what you said on January 12. Why would that be the case? Bob Livingston : Just the simple true up to the final accounting that's the simplest way to say it. John Inch : Okay. And then, Brad was there an offset to the $0.05 tax benefit. I know you don't \u2013 these things move around a lot. I just wanted to \u2013 it\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts this quarter. I just wanted to make sure if there was an offset for that? Bob Livingston : To the $0.05? John Inch : Yes. But that\u2019s\u2026 Bob Livingston : That's our discrete tax and this is no real offset to that, no. So you could think about within the guide, the previous guide range of $3 to $3.05, the discrete put us \u2013 if you include them we\u2019re at the upper end of the range, if you exclude them we\u2019re at the lower end of the range versus where we were previously. John Inch : Okay. Bob Livingston : As you know we don't forecast discrete tax benefits. They are very lumpy. They come when they come so to speak. There was an international piece associated with this $0.05 and some state related reserves. So very much tail end related. In fact, we had to wait to see the year completed itself before we knew for sure whether we met the goal to release them and that's why it was very late in the game. John Inch : That's fine. What were the fluid margins X Wayne and Tokheim? I was just looking at my notes and I think there were 19.3% a year ago if you X out deal cost and purchase accounting that may not be wholly accurate. I just think I remember that. So I'm just curious. Brad Cerepak : Well, we have the number at, I'd say excluding restructuring, deal costs and the like, last year I have 18.3. John Inch : Okay. What were they this quarter X Tokheim, I guess Tokheim is not in there, what were the X Wayne? Brad Cerepak : X Wayne and Tokheim, Tokheim still acquisition, this it crush over into\u2026 Brad Cerepak : In '17. Brad Cerepak : In '17. I'm sorry. Let's make sure we got our years right here. In '16 it was 18.3%. Are you asking for what '15 was? John Inch : Yes. I was trying to compare the apples-to-apples, Brad. I'm sorry. Brad Cerepak : Okay. John Inch : So the fourth quarter of 2015. Brad Cerepak : 19\u2026 Brad Cerepak : That was the full year Bob. Bob Livingston : Yeah, 19.7. John Inch : That was 19.7 and then what was it in the fourth quarter of '16 if you axe out the Wayne? Bob Livingston : 18.3. John Inch : Right. Got it. Okay. That was all I had. Thanks much. Bob Livingston : Very good. Thanks. Operator : We have time for one final question this morning. Our final question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Maybe going back to Steve's question earlier on cash flow, so the quarter was about or the year was about $50 million lighter than we expected. Is that predominately because of big inventory build because orders were better is that - did I hear that right earlier? Bob Livingston : Well, no actually, I don't know if I can say predominant. I know that was one of the characteristics that was different in the fourth quarter, especially in December. I would also tell you that we actually didn't have the rollover in Hillphoenix revenue in December like we normally see. And Hillphoenix is a pretty big generator of cash for us in the fourth quarter historically, so it is a little bit of inventory and a little bit of DSO. But I'm telling you there's nothing unusual in it, Joe. Brad Cerepak : Yes, 50-50 maybe on that 50 million split between receivables and inventory. Bob Livingston : What is unusual from an operating perspective is to actually see as build inventory through the quarter. Joe Ritchie : Well, so that kind of brings me to my follow-on question, right? Because as we're progressing through 2017 it looks like you are basically forecasting high teens cash flow growth year-over-year at a time when your orders are improving, I would expect some type of inventory build. And so how are you guys thinking about inventory and just more generally net working capital for 2017? Bob Livingston : Okay. I don't have an exact numbers here. I know we've got working capital \u2013 our working capital target for '17. I don't have the absolute number. I know we're - our internal targets are to reduce our working capital metric. I think its 60 or 80 bps in '17 with most of the emphasis, most of that improvement coming out of inventory. Joe Ritchie : Okay. So all right, so the plan is to reduce inventory while orders are going to get better. Okay. And then maybe the last question, you guys mentioned in the Fluids business that there's improved activity in petrochem in 2017. Is that a function of some of these petrochemical crackers that are getting completed in North America? Or what's really, kind of\u2026 Bob Livingston : No. It\u2019s \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t label North America is a big driver of that for us this year. We have participated in this. We continue to participate in that, but the upside in '17 we're actually starting to see some of the emerging economies especially in China. In fact, our \u2013 we have had some pleasantly to note we've had even here early in January we've had a very strong start on order activity in China with respect to this vertical. Joe Ritchie : Okay. That's good to hear. Thanks, guys. Bob Livingston : Thanks. Operator : That concludes today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for any closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : Thanks, Kristine. Yeah. This concludes our conference call. We thank you again for your continued interest in Dover, and certainly look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a good afternoon. Bye. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the fourth quarter 2016 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Let me begin by saying I am very pleased with our first quarter business activity and results. Revenue and bookings growth was broad based at every segment. I was very encouraged by our organic performance as revenue was up 4% and bookings increased 12%. When factoring the significant contribution from acquisitions as well as the impact from dispositions, revenue and bookings grew a very healthy 12% and 21% respectively.  During the quarter, the recovery of our US drilling and production markets accelerated on higher than expected rig count. Well completions also expanded in the quarter. Further, our businesses serving the printing and identification, retail fueling, and retail refrigeration markets, as well as the majority of our other industrial markets had very solid activity. From a geographic perspective, US, Europe, and China markets all grew organically year over year. From a segment perspective, energy exceeded expectations with broad based improvements. Revenue was up 15% organically, largely driven by early cycle upstream applications benefiting both our drilling and artificial lift businesses. Our automation and bearings and compression businesses also had a very strong quarter. We converted very well on the volume improvements, resulting in segment margin above expectations.  Engineered Systems growth of 5% reflected another strong quarter in printing, identification, and the impact of acquisitions. In the industrial platform, growth in the majority of our end markets, most notably auto service equipment, was offset by reduced volume in our Environmental Solutions business. Of note, although chassis supply has been challenging, it did improve as we exited the quarter. Overall, bookings were very strong.  Fluids also had a very solid quarter, posting 32% revenue growth. Solid activity in retail fueling, along with the majority of our other businesses, was partially offset by continued softness and longer cycle oil and gas applications, most notably transport activity. Of note, Dover Fueling Solutions had strong first quarter market activity and remains on track with our integration plans and delivery of synergy benefits.  Refrigeration and food equipment revenue grew 5% organically. This result primarily reflects strong activity in the retail refrigeration market, especially in the glass door and refrigeration case and systems product lines. Customers are increasingly closing medium temperature cases, which is benefiting our business.  Now looking forward. In energy, stronger than expected US rig count deployment, along with increasing well completion activity, will result in higher full year revenue growth than previously expected. We are now assuming the 2017 average US rig count to be between 820 and 840, up significantly from our forecast at the beginning of the year. We are maintaining our forecast for the average WTI price to be around $55. Our improved outlook reflects our strong position in the Permian and the success of our drill bit insert and ESP product lines. We are also benefiting from improved bill rates by our bearing and compressions OEM customers. In Engineered Systems, we expect our printing and identification platform to continue to deliver consistent solid performance, driven by our unique position in the digital textile market and our focus on consumables in marking and coding. Regarding our industrial platform, we anticipate an increase in year-over-year organic revenue driven by our strong bookings. Within fluids, we expect the majority of our businesses to remain solid, including retail fueling, hygienic and pharma, and other industrial markets. The strong overall growth rate in this segment will be primarily driven by Dover Fueling Solutions, where the US is growing nicely and European markets are improving. We also expect our transport market, which has largely stabilized sequentially, to benefit from easier comps in the back half of the year. Finally, in refrigeration and food equipment, healthy bookings, especially in retail refrigeration, will drive higher revenue than previously forecasted. The strength in our retail refrigeration business reflects our leading position in glass doors and cases as well as our technology around energy efficiency. We also expect food equipment to have a solid year.  Given the continuing strength of our bookings activity as we enter the second quarter, we feel confident of delivering strong performance across all segments in 2017. As a result, we are raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Bob. Good morning everyone. Let's start on Slide three of our presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $1.8 billion, an increase of 12%. Growth from acquisitions of 12% was complemented by organic growth of 4%. Partially offsetting these strong results was a 4% impact from dispositions and FX.  EPS was a $1.09 and included a gain of $0.39. Adjusted EPS of $0.70 exceeded the high end of our expectations, principally reflecting strong performance on higher revenue and a lower tax rate.  Adjusted segment margin was 11.8%, an 80 basis point improvement over last year, largely driven by strong incremental margin on increased volume in our energy segment. Bookings increased 21% to $2 billion. This positive result was broad based and reflects organic growth of 12% and acquisition growth of 12%, offset by a 3% combined impact of dispositions and FX. Total company book to bill finished at a seasonally strong 1.12. Overall, our backlog increased 20% to $1.3 billion. On an organic basis, backlog increased 13%. Free cash flow was $36 million for the first quarter, which is always our lowest quarter of the year. Our quarterly result was impacted by inventory increases driven by selective pre-builds. Overall, we remain committed to full year free cash flow of about 11% of revenue or 140% of net income.  Now turning to Slide four. Organic growth in the quarter was solid led by energies growth of 15% on improving US oil and gas fundamentals. Refrigeration and food equipment increased 5%, primarily on strong retail refrigeration markets. Engineered Systems was up 2%, primarily reflecting continued solid growth in printing and identification. Fluids organic revenue declined 2%, principally reflecting weak longer cycle transport markets. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth in the quarter was most prevalent at Fluids and Engineered Systems at 35% and 9% respectively. Now moving to Slide five. Energy revenue of $324 million increased 14% year over year and 11% sequentially. Earnings were $42 million and segment margin was 12.9%, both significantly improved over last year. These results exceeded our expectations, driven by continuing improvements in oil and gas fundamentals, especially the US retail. These results also reflect strong conversion on volume.  Bookings of $348 million were up 27% year over year and 16% sequentially. These bookings trends, along with continued rig count additions and higher expected well completions, set us up for a strong second quarter. In total, in the second quarter, we expect year over year revenue growth of about 30% or 4% on a sequential basis. Book to bill finished at 1.07. Turning to Slide six. Engineered Systems revenue of $608 million was up 5% overall and included organic growth of 2%. Excluding a gain on a disposition, earnings of $86 million increased 4% over an adjusted prior year, driven by volume growth. Our Printing and Identification platform revenue of $249 million increased 4%. Organic revenue was up 5%, reflecting solid global marking and coding and strong digital textile markets. In the industrial platform, revenue increased 6% to $359 million. This result included net acquisition growth of 8% and a 1% organic decline. The organic decline was attributable to lower shipments at environmental solutions. The remaining businesses in the industrial platform, all delivered solid organic growth, especially our auto service equipment business. Adjusted margin was 14.2%, essentially in line with last year. Bookings of $676 million were up 18% overall, including organic bookings growth of 12% and growth from net acquisitions of 7%. Organic bookings growth was very broad based, with printing and identification up 7% and industrials up 15%. Book to bill for printing and identification was 1.03. Industirals was 1.17. Overall book to bill was 1.11. Now on Slide seven. Foods revenue increased 32% to $525 million, principally driven by acquisitions. This revenue performance primarily reflects solid activity across the majority of our businesses, especially retail fueling within fueling and transport. This market is benefiting from robust activity in the US and also from improving international activity. Overall, organic revenue declined 2% and FX was a 1% headwind. Earnings increased 14% to $53 million, largely driven by volume growth, offset in part by $4 million of integration and restructuring costs. Margin in the quarter was 10%, slightly better than expected. Bookings grew significantly to $566 million, an increase of 35%. This result reflects acquisition growth of 35% and organic growth of 2%. Organics booking growth was broad based. Book to bill was 1.08. Now let's turn to Slide eight. Refrigeration and food equipments revenue of $357 million included organic revenue growth of 5%. Organic revenue increase was largely driven by the strong activity in the glass door and refrigeration case product lines. Food equipment results reflected solid organic growth in the commercial kitchen equipment markets, offset by expected lower shipments in can shaping equipment. Earnings of $34 million were down 12% year over year, reflecting a $2 million impact from a disposition in the prior year and approximately $2 million in restructuring. Margin was 9.4%, 110 basis points below last year and largely in line with our forecast. Bookings of $439 million increased 7% overall and 13% organically, reflecting strong order rates in nearly all of our end markets. Book to bill was seasonally strong at 1.23. Going to the overview on Slide nine, let me cover some highlights. Corporate expense and interest expense were both essentially in line with expectations. Our first quarter tax rate was 25.7%, reflecting the impact of a disposition and other discrete items of about $0.04. Excluding these items, our normalized rate was 27.8%.  Moving on to Slide 10 which shows our 2017 guidance. As Bob previously mentioned, we are increasing our annual guidance. We now expect total revenue to increase 11% to 13% versus our prior forecast of 10% to 12%. This forecast includes organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%, up one point. Our expectation for full year acquisition growth is largely unchanged. Completed dispositions will now impact revenue by 2% and FX is now expected to be a 1% headwind.  From a segment perspective, energy is now expected to grow 20% to 23% organically, up seven points over the last forecast, largely driven by the growth in our drilling and production and automation businesses. Engineered Systems and Fluids organic growth rates are both being raised one point at the low end, driven by solid bookings growth. Refrigeration and food equipments estimated revenue range has been increased one point to reflect our strong first quarter and continued bookings momentum. Corporate expense has been increased $5 million and net interest expense remains unchanged from our last forecast. Our full year tax rate is now expected to be slightly lower than our initial estimate, largely driven by favorable tax items reported in the first quarter. Our forecast for CapEx and free cash flow is also unchanged from the prior forecast. Lastly, we now expect full year segment margin to be around 14%, excluding the gain, up about 30 basis points from our prior forecast. Turning to the bridge on Slide eleven. Starting with 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.85 as a base, the year over year impact of lower restructuring cost in 2017 is unchanged. Performance, including volume productivity pricing and restructuring benefits, is now expected to increase $0.29 from the prior forecast at the midpoint, principally driven by our improved organic revenue forecast, especially at energy. Compensation investment will now be about $0.02 higher than our prior forecast. The combined impact of interest corporate expense and the tax rate is about $0.01 lower than our prior forecast. Lastly, the full year net benefit from disposition will be $0.35. This represents a gain on sale of $0.39 less the $0.04 of previously forecasted earnings from the divested business. In total, we expect 2017 EPS to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.20.  With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Bob for some final thoughts. Bob Livingston : Thanks, Brad. As we begin the second quarter, I am pleased with the start to our year. Our strong first quarter bookings growth was much more than oil and gas recovery. I like the growth we are seeing across our portfolio and across our major geographic regions. This overall improvement sets the stage for stronger revenue growth in 2017. Beyond the markets, we continue to make strides in several other areas. We are actively investing for growth around Dover. We are increasing sales and customer facing resources, expanding engineering talent and all businesses are focused on driving growth. In addition, we are building our capabilities within many of our businesses. One example of this is our new digital textile printing center of excellence to promote this exciting technology and accelerate its adoption.  We are also continuing to drive productivity through a number of initiatives, including global supply chain, our shared service organization and through relentless efforts around lean and facility consolidation. These efforts, combined with our four main objectives heading into the year, are our primary focus. As a reminder, the objectives are to fully leverage the North American oil and gas recovery, capture significant market opportunities from our acquisitions in Fluids and Engineered Systems, drive core margin improvement and successfully integrate our new acquisitions and capture the synergy benefits. We are doing well against these objectives.  Our energy results have been very strong. Our recent Wayne and RAV acquisitions are performing above plan. Our integration plan is on track and segment margin is showing improvement. In all, while we still have several opportunities for improvement, we've made meaningful progress in a number of key areas. In summary, our markets remain very constructive as we begin the second quarter and I am confident we will continue to perform well, execute on our objectives and leverage our strengths.  With that, I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for staying focused on our customers. Okay Paul, let\u2019s take some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks, Bob. Before we take questions, I just want to remind the group that we have several people in queue. So if you can ask one question with a follow up, I'm sure that everybody on the line will appreciate that. And with that, Paula, if we can have the first question. Operator : Your first question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Morning guys. Hey Bob, maybe start with kind of the mix of business through the year on energy. You talked about rig count better than expected. You also mentioned well completions. Can you talk about how much is being driven by drilling at this point and how you see a bit of the hand off or the pickup from artificial lift phasing maybe through the year? Bob Livingston : Yes. Good question, Shannon. So that's a forward question, not a first quarter question, correct? Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Both. Yes. Bob Livingston : Yes, both. Okay. So I would say in the first quarter I think the over performance in energy was primarily attributable to the rig count activity being higher than we expected coming into the year. We did see well completion activity increase during the first quarter, but at a much lower rate than we saw on the rate of change with respect to drilling activity. In fact the industry data - I just looked at, I guess it was just a few days ago, even with the well completion activity increase in the first quarter, uncompleted well backlog actually increased in the first quarter. So as we look at the balance of the year with respect to energy, we've got a bit more of a muted expectation with respect to rate of change on rig count in the second, third, and fourth quarters.  We still see increases, but the rate of change will be quite less than we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, but we are expecting to see well completion activity pick up, especially in the second half of the year. I mentioned this increase in uncompleted wells in the first quarter. Shannon, here is where I would probably be willing right now to give a comment with respect to \u201918. I think this uncompleted well backlog that will see activity start to increase again here is in the second and third quarter. I think it really is setting this energy segment up well for continued well completion activity into 2018 and perhaps even beyond. We feel quite bullish about the well completion activity in front of us. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, great. And then just on refrigeration, seeing some nice strong orders there, just your thoughts on converting that to margin based on some of the production changes you've made in the plants and the change in the mix of orders, et cetera. And then it also sounds like close-the-case is picking up a bit. So maybe just, as you think about the changing mix of the business and the production changes you've made, how confident are you in the ability to convert those orders into attractive margins. Bob Livingston : So it's - let me comment first on the close-the-case activity. I think we commented on this both at our investor dinner earlier in the year as well as on our January call that this was a big change that we truly did expect to see. We expected change to be rather measurable in 2017 to start to see more and more of the medium temp door cases being taken by our customers with doors on them. That is happening. So that increase in activity both at Hill Phoenix, and I would also say at Anthony was fairly healthy in the first quarter. And we expect that change to continue and we feel very well positioned to benefit from that change. To your other question, with respect to Hill Phoenix, the activity in the first quarter, I would say that our production efficiency and manufacturing initiatives that we had planned for the first quarter, I think we executed well. The results we were looking for in the first quarter were on plan, if not slightly better than we expected, but I'll also repeat myself again. You\u2019re not going to see the pickup in margins in this segment until the second half of the year. And I think the effort that the guys are working on inside the factory and their productivity efforts in the second quarter will continue to show progress and we will deliver these margin improvements in the second half. Shannon O\u2019Callaghan: Okay, great. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Good morning guys. Yes. So - wow, what difference three months makes. I wanted to stick with refrigeration. Bob Livingston : What? It\u2019s your birthday, Nigel? Nigel Coe : Sorry? Bob Livingston : Did you have a birthday? Nigel Coe : I'm kind of forgetting my birthday at this age. But sticking with refrigeration, obviously a huge uptick in backlog activity there. I\u2019m just wondering, have we seen a change in the underlying market conditions? Is there some large projects stored the numbers, gaining share? Any color there would be helpful. Bob Livingston : I'm not going to comment on share gains. We actually won't see the industry data on the first quarter for probably another three or four weeks. But the profile in the first quarter was different, Nigel. We know we had some activity with a couple of customers, one of them being one of our top five or six customers, that those orders we would typically have expected to be second quarter orders, they came in in the first quarter. To put us in perspective, we're actually not changing our expectations for the first half with respect to Hill Phoenix. So the over performance we had on orders and in revenue in the first quarter, we're assuming right now we'll pay that back a little bit here in the second quarter, but we are looking for an improved forecast for the year. That said, I will tell you that the order activity so far in April has been quite reflective of what we were seeing in February and in March. So it's - this is one area where we could have another pleasant surprise here in the second quarter. Nigel Coe : Okay, great. And then maybe for Brad. Can you just call out the impact to refrigeration margins from the manufacturing alignment and also the impact to fluids margins from Wayne accounting? Brad Cerepak : Holy. Let\u2019s see here. I'm looking at Bob. So I actually don't have in front of me the data on the Wayne margins inclusive of ADNA. They're not negative, but they\u2019re - we are - as your question infers, we are eating a fair amount of purchase accounting charges here in the first quarter. From a full year perspective, let me give you this comment. I think you should have a fairly good feel for the ADNA for this business for the full year. We do see the operating margins for Wayne and Tokheim expanding through the year. The first quarter is the lowest quarter of the year, both in revenue and earnings for this business. I think for the year, we're looking at margins for the year of 11% in my operating margins brand, 11% for the year, with the fourth quarter being maybe 300 basis points higher than the yearly average. And the first quarter was - I don't think we hit 8% operating margins in the first quarter. Bob Livingston : Just shy of 8%. Brad Cerepak : Just shy of 8%. Yes. So I guess to add to that. The Wayne business is typically double digit, slightly over double digit type margin profile, ex ADNA again, all these numbers that Bob is talking about. And Tokheim, we've told you before is in the high single. So the combination of those two \u2026 Bob Livingston : Is 11 for the year. Brad Cerepak : Is about 11 for the year. Now, we're - what I would say is DFS or Dover \u2026 Bob Livingston : Fueling Solutions. Brad Cerepak : Fueling Solutions, we're off to a great start there. I would expect that we will beat our plan with respect to acquisition, delivery of EPS related to DFS. Nigel Coe : Great and then just any color on the manufacturing costs in refrigeration? Bob Livingston : I think we still had some production variances in the first quarter. I would call them production variances higher than what they should be, but that variance is half of what it was in the fourth quarter and in the third quarter of last year. I will point out one of the things with respect to refrigeration, Nigel. even though we did see the improvement in production variances, what I call the factory variances in the first quarter and my earlier comment, was as planned, if not a bit better. we were encountering some input cost - metal cost headwinds in the first quarter and Brad, that number was probably about $4 million higher metal cost than we had anticipated coming into the year. We'll continue to see that as a headwind in the second quarter. We are processing material surcharges with our customers. We expect to offset not all of it because there is a lag, but we expect offset a significant chunk of that as we go through the year. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague at Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you gentlemen. Good morning. Wonder if we could just flesh out a little bit more on the energy progression. And I guess the nature of my question is to make sure we get kind of the margin dynamics correct here. So you clearly obviously had a very, very rich mix in Q1 with drilling leading your business up. Bob Livingston : Good catch. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. So I'm trying to kind of balance the idea of you still should show very good operating leverage off of the press space and every one of your businesses, but as the completion activity comes up and perhaps other things are going on, how should we think about this margin progression for the year. Brad Cerepak : Okay. So let's stay with the first quarter first. As you know, the conversion there was significant year over year. Adjusted ex restructuring, Jeff, 60% conversion year over year, driven on the strength of drilling as you point out. Sequential improvement in margin on the higher volume about 30%, 31%. As I think about it going forward, and we gave you some numbers related to the second quarter in our script, the pre read, I\u2019m thinking that the year over year for the year, for the full year, will be in the 40% range. So coming off that high first quarter conversion will moderate based upon the mix of business. But sequentially I still see going sequential improvement in that 30% range. Jeffrey Sprague : And according, that\u2019s with the restructuring, X, that's underlying ex all restructuring costs. Brad Cerepak : Yes, it is. Bob Livingston : Yes. And I would add one other point here to what Brad just shared with you. I think you will also see us here in the second quarter and third quarter add a little bit of cost back into the segment. We have tried to stay as lean as we possibly could in the fourth quarter and first quarter, but as the drilling activity continues to increase and we start to see an increase in well completion activity, Jeff I don't want to see a lead time stretch. Jeffrey Sprague : Right. Just a quick follow up on energy and then I have one other question. Just how should we think about the growth in your drill business versus the rig count in the quarter? I assume you lag that growth by some amount as we inflect it higher. I think the rig count was up 33%. Bob Livingston : Yes. I do that data, Brad. My recall is, is that our improvement, our rev - our top line growth in our drill bit and serve business, was actually fairly well correlated with the increase in rig count. In fact it may have been a bit higher. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay, great. And then just quickly on cash flow, looked unusually low in the quarter. What's going on there? It sounds like you're pretty comfortable with the year. Brad Cerepak : Still feel very comfortable with the year. First quarter activity was a little bit stronger than we expected, Jeff coming into the quarter. So the inventory levels naturally were a bit higher. Receivables a little bit higher than we expected, but I would also tell you that in a couple areas of the business, we did make decisions about halfway through the quarter to do some selective pre-builds to make sure we were holding delivery times where we wanted them to be in the second quarter. And that's - they were \u2026 Bob Livingston : (Indiscernible) about 40 million. Brad Cerepak : About 40 million. Bob Livingston : 40, 45 million of free flow. Brad Cerepak : $40 million of inventory that was - I would just label as pre-builds to support second quarter delivery schedules. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Good morning. Just to get away a little bit from drilling and refrigeration, you\u2019ve sort of made this commentary that I think in every segment that you're seeing broad based booking strength. We getting a lot of questions from investors about the macro environment. What\u2019s your read on the macro in the US and globally based on this booking strength? What does it tell you? Bob Livingston : Well, so if I could ignore I'll call it projects, which tend to distort some of the numbers on occasion, I would say that the industrial activity we were seeing here in North America, here in the US, was fairly indicative of what we were seeing in the third and fourth quarter of last year. And by that, I am also telling you, probably not much of an increase. I mean it was healthy, but I'm not sure we actually saw - I would label it as an increase in market activity here in the US. In Europe I would label the first quarter activity and perhaps even what our expectations are for the second quarter, as an improvement in general market activity for Europe.  Our growth in China was fairly strong. It was I think our organic growth in China may have been - it was better than mid single digits. I think it may have been 7% or 8%, even approaching 10% in the first quarter. And that's important for us because I think I made this comment on our January call with respect to the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of last year was organic positive for us in China. And I believe the fourth quarter was our first quarter in about seven we'd actually had positive organic growth. So we see that as a fairly positive signal for our business activity in China. The balance of the year may not be pushing 10%, but we look at it as a fairly healthy market for us over the balance of the year. Andrew Obin : And just a follow up on fluids within your pumps business. Maybe I missed it. could you just comment on the pricing environment and what are you seeing in terms of bookings on the pumps, and as I said, the quality of the backlog and where it's coming from, and when does it inflect positively? I guess that\u2019s the question. Bob Livingston : Well, if your comment is on industrial and by that, you're asking me to exclude the impact of some of the later cycle oil and gas activity that we're doing. Andrew Obin : No. actually no. All inclusive, including the \u2026 Bob Livingston : Oh, inclusive of that. Okay. Andrew Obin : Yes. Bob Livingston : I know the second half is positive organic growth for our pumps business. And Brad is nodding yes. The second quarter is as well. I knew the second half was. So I think our inflection point is the first quarter. And we\u2019re anticipating fairly healthy mid single digit organic growth out of our pumps business for the balance of the year. Andrew Obin : And how is pricing? Bob Livingston : Normal. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much. Congratulations. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Good morning. So just to kind of put a bow on it. I guess the 40% incremental ex structuring for the year, is that around the 13% margin for energy? What\u2019s the margin you\u2019re dialing in for energy for the year? Brad Cerepak : Slightly over 13, yes. Bob Livingston : Slightly above 13. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just, you guys had given I think some color on the margins for the rest of the segments during the guidance period. Maybe if you could just update some of those or any change. I think it was 15 point, high 15 to 16 in energy and engineered, 13 in changing fluids, 13 in change refrigeration. Maybe just give us some update on the margins by segment for the year. Brad Cerepak : So I think, Steve you're dead on with those numbers. Here what I would say, is we just went through energy. We\u2019re up 30 to 40 basis points from our last estimates. So that spread pretty evenly across the other three segments. That\u2019s the best way to think of it. So everybody up slightly with energy being up significant. Steve Tusa : All right. And then just the - I guess just the second quarter, the margin cadence in fluids, seasonally there's a little bit of noise there from the acquisition, et cetera. Is that - what should we think about as the margin there for the second quarter? Bob Livingston : Well, I mean I think it's going to be indicative of the full year type of rate. Steve Tusa : Okay. Bob Livingston : So I think you\u2019ll see that and that rate will build into the third \u2026 Brad Cerepak : Through the third and the fourth. Bob Livingston : Yes, so that the total year, the second quarter looks like the full year, but the first quarter is lower as you know. So it has to build into the back half as the seasonality of the business there. Steve Tusa : Right. and then just one last quickly on the product recall charge you took in the fourth quarter, I noticed in the 10-Q that was I think tweaked down a little bit from what you had originally expected. Would that have been a change - did that impact the income statement at all/ Brad Cerepak : No. That\u2019s just cash payments against the reserves. Steve Tusa : Okay, got it. Bob Livingston : Yes. No P&L impact. Steve Tusa : Got it. Okay, thanks a lot. Operator : [Operator instructions]. Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning guys. Bob or Brad, you mentioned that your organic backlog growth was up 13% as of the first quarter, but you only raised your organic revenue guide for the year up a percent to 5%. So maybe you can talk about the balance between being conservative, maybe more difficult comparison in the second half of the year. And are there any concerns you have in any of your businesses that they could be a little slower in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. Bob Livingston : Any of our businesses being slower in the second half, I cannot think of a single one. Brad Cerepak : No. Bob Livingston : No. The answer is no. With respect to your question, are we being a bit conservative with respect to our outlook given the 13% organic growth in bookings in the first quarter? Let me take you back to my comment earlier on refrigeration. We had really strong bookings in refrigeration in the first quarter. The book to bill, gosh, what was it like? 1.2 or 1.25, something like that. I think - I'm not sure I'd label it conservative as much as I would express some caution as we enter the second and third quarter, which is typically the ramp season for Hill Phoenix and Anthony. I made a comment earlier. I have - I think we have some belief that the strong bookings we saw and the strong revenue we saw in the first quarter, we would have normally had some of those bookings and some of those shipments in the second quarter.  So as we move into the second quarter, I think I'm being a little bit cautious, but conservative perhaps. We\u2019ll see - let us play the second quarter out and you can tell me whether we were conservative or just being cautious. If you look at it around the rest of Dover, I think we're boding well and if there is an opportunity for us being described as being conservative, it could very well be - and the point you're making here that maybe there is a little bit of caution even beyond refrigeration. Will the bookings rates that we saw in the first quarter continue into the second half? And the only thing I can share with you right now is that the order rates in April are very reflective of what we were seeing in February and March. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay Bob, that's very helpful. And maybe focusing on ESG, you mentioned cross engineered systems broad based organic bookings growth. And then you mentioned that ESG, the chassis availability issue is getting better toward the end of your quarter. I think you said previously that you would expect it to improve significantly in 2Q. So maybe talk about the expectations for that particular business unit. Do you still think 2Q should look materially better within that business and underlying environment around that business? Bob Livingston : Q2 will be significantly better within this business than we've seen not just in the fourth quarter, but I would say significantly better than what we saw in the second half of last year. Our bookings within this business in the first quarter were actually quite strong. The market activity for us is quite healthy. I think the book to bill within that business in the first quarter - gosh Brad, 1.3, something like that. It was quite healthy. For the full year, organic growth is up nicely in this business. It may be pushing high single digits for the year. So we see a very strong recovery in this business in the second, third and fourth quarters. The chassis delivery has started to improve. We saw significant improvements in March. We see further improvements in April, and I think by the time we exit the second quarter, we'll feel like our shipment production schedule and our chassis delivery will be well matched. Andrew Kaplowitz : Great. Thanks, Bob. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays. Scott Davis : Good morning guys. I'm not sure you mentioned anything, or if you did, I apologize, but you mention anything about your M&A plans for the rest of 2017, the backlog with how things are tracking in that regard? Bob Livingston : I guess I would give you a similar comment that I've shared on previous calls. We remain very active at looking at some of our targets and having discussions with companies that have been on our target list for two, three or sometimes 10 years. We announced a small acquisition, I guess it was in April. Brad Cerepak : Yes, in April. Bob Livingston : Early April with respect to our digital textile printing initiative. Don't expect anything significant from us in M&A over the next three or four months, Scott. But you may see us close on a couple of smaller deals, sort of reflective of the size that you saw in this announcement earlier this month. Scott Davis : Okay. And just, can you remind me what your balance sheet capability, or what you think your next 12 months potential balance sheet number is going to be? Bob Livingston : My number is always higher than Brad\u2019s. We\u2019ve traditionally said it's in the order of magnitude of $500 million to $700 million, that range. Scott Davis : Okay. And does book to bill give you confidence to step up in that regard? I mean just commenting on the fact you didn\u2019t buy back any shares in 1Q. Bob Livingston : Look, the execution on our M&A targets, it is significantly lesser influenced by our backlog and it is the ability to reach a conclusion and agreement with the owners of the targets. Don't expect us to announce a share repurchase program for 2017. Our focus is still on growing the business. Scott Davis : Okay, very clear. Thank you guys. Good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Hey, was hoping you could give some more color regarding your comment that the Wayne integration is ahead of plan? Bob Livingston : Okay. Like what? Deane Dray : Integration, new product development, geographic. Bob Livingston : Let see. The bookings in the first quarter, a little bit stronger than we had in our beginning of the year plan for both Wayne and Tokheim, actually for the entire business, Dover Fueling Solutions. I don't remember what the number was in excess of our plan, but $10 million or $12 million greater than we had anticipated. Synergy, the synergy capture activity was on plan. I would counter that by also saying that are our cost to achieve on our integration activity, we did pull some of that forward from the second quarter into the first quarter. Brad, $1.5 million, $2 million? Brad Cerepak : About $2 million. Bob Livingston : Increased spending on restructuring and the second quarter within fluids than we had in our opening plan for the quarter. Europe, Tokheim did very, very well in Europe in the first quarter. That said, I'd also have to remind - I keep reminding myself and I\u2019ll remind you that we didn't do very well in Europe in the first quarter of last year with Tokheim, but the step up year over year by Tokheim in Europe in the first quarter was actually fairly impressive and we feel like that market is beginning to recover for them and they are executing very well. With respect to combining the two businesses, we actually had a price increase in Europe in the first quarter. I think on the Tokheim brand we processed a price increase in 1st of February and with Wayne in Europe, the price increase was announced the 1st of March. This is very noteworthy, Deane because I think this may be the first price increase in Europe in this market in, could be seven or eight years. It\u2019s been a long time and the early read is that the price increase is sticking. So all in all, we're quite pleased with the market activity. We are pleased with what the teams are achieving early in the process on the capture benefits. And we were very pleased that we could move some of the restructuring of what I\u2019d label as the cost to achieve forward from the second quarter into the first quarter. So all in all I'm very happy with this business in the first quarter. Deane Dray : Great. That\u2019s real helpful. And just, my follow up, on the mix in energy, I know we saw strength in bearings and compression in the fourth quarter. It looked like it was still pretty healthy into the first quarter. What\u2019s the expectation there? I know that a lot of the focus has been on the drilling and the production side, but how about on the longer cycle equipment? Bob Livingston : Well, you've picked it up correctly. Bearings and compression performance in the first quarter was healthier, was stronger, both revenue and earnings than we had anticipated coming into the year. For the entire year 2017, this business top line organic will be up mid single digits. And margins, margins are performing quite well and continuing to expand, as they should. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Good morning. Just wanted to ask about pricing in energy. It was flat sequentially, down 60 bps year on year. maybe give any color as to how you see that playing out over the rest of the year, and if there are any interesting trends within the sub segments of the business. Bob Livingston : So let's see here. I think if - when we do the analysis, we would show that pricing was down in the first quarter within energy. Brad, it's a little under $2 million for the first quarter? Brad Cerepak : Yes. Bob Livingston : But I would also say this was price concessions that were delivered to customers in the second quarter of last year. I do not believe there were any price concessions agreed to in the second half of last year. Am I correct with that statement? Okay. So what we're seeing here in the first quarter is sort of the burn off or the tail end of the price concessions that we gave up in the second quarter of last year. With respect to our guide for2017, we are not including any price increases other than those that we would normally see as we introduce new products where the pricing on those new products may be a bit healthier or stronger than the product it is replacing. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thank you. And then my follow up would just be back to refrigeration and food equipment, just food equipment specifically. You\u2019ve had a tough revenue trend for the past 12 months. It sounds like that's mostly in can shaping still. Bob Livingston : It is. Yes. Julian Mitchell : How do you see that playing out from here in terms of the recovery slope? Bob Livingston : The recovery slope here is pretty strong in the balance of the year for food equipment. With respect to our food service equipment in the first quarter, we had quite healthy organic growth rates just within the food service equipment. We still had some really tough comps in can shaping. We had very good order activity in can shaping in the first quarter. And their plan for the year will have growth. I also think it's high single digits for the year. And here's an important thing to note on that business. I actually believe that the bulk of our revenue forecast for the balance of the year, it may be as much as 80% of our production forecast for the balance of the year within can shaping is in our backlog. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : Thanks Paula. This concludes our conference call. With that, we thank you as always for your continued interest in Dover and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Have a good day. Thanks. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s first quarter 2017 Dover Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Bob Livingston : Thanks Paul, good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our second quarter reflected the continuation of a trend that began to develop late last year, namely, improving global markets and strong results reflecting solid execution by our teams. These factors resulted in revenue growth and margin expansion that exceeded our forecast. All segments posted sequential margin improvement, most notably, in refrigeration and food equipment, and in fluids. And these segments, our work on integration, productivity, and commercial excellence resulted in improved performance in the quarter. Overall, our segments performed at a high level which we expect to continue. We are raising our full-year guidance for revenue and EPS reflecting our strong second quarter results and our increased confidence in the back half of the year across all segments. As we highlighted at our June Investor Day we expect strong performance over the next few years in both organic revenue growth and margin expansion. Delivering on our 2017 commitments is a critical step towards achieving our three year plan. I\u2019m pleased to say we are executing well on our revenue growth and margin expansion activities. Our work on involving the portfolio over the past several years is yielding tangible benefits. It has been a steady and purposeful transformation as we have focused on building great businesses. With 60% of our revenue from businesses that hold a Number One or Number Two market share, we have built and expanded the leading positions serving growth markets through platforms like marking and coding, fueling and transport and pumps to name just a few. We continue to have significant potential to expand revenue and margin as we apply our operating model to improve every business and use inorganic investment to strengthen our businesses even further. With regard to evolving our portfolio, we have focused on markets at all for solid long-term growth rates markets where expertise and solution set is valued and in markets that provide opportunities for further expansion. Regarding our operating model, we strive to make the businesses we own better through the steady application of a number of value creating tools and processes. We started with the establishment of our global sourcing organization several years ago, to investments in talent development and embedding a continuous improvement process across the organization to more recent investments in shared services.  We have steadily been adding capabilities and have a clear and executable path to sustained business improvement. Our discipline strategy of positioning ourselves in strong markets and improving our businesses allows us to generate significant free cash flow. Some of this cash will be returned annually through increasing dividends while much of it will be in reinvested to further grow our businesses thus creating even stronger platforms. In short, we believe today we have world-class leading platforms and attractive markets and are well positioned to deliver growth, margin expansion, and consistent free cash flow yield. With that I'd like to turn it over to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks Bob, good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned we had a very strong second quarter. We achieved organic revenue and bookings growth at every segment. Leverage on this organic growth combined with solid contributions from our recent acquisitions and strong execution on margin improvement activities resulted in an overall segment margin of 15%. Sequentially, this represents a 320 basis point improvement over the adjusted first quarter. There were several highlights in the quarter, including broad-based growth in engineered systems, the return of organic growth in fluids, and meaningful progress in the retail fueling integration, productivity and commercial improvements in refrigeration and food equipment, and lastly strong growth in energy on a higher than expected US rig count and increased well completions. Also from a geographic perspective, US, Europe and China markets all grew organically year over year. As noted earlier, we are increasing our full-year revenue and EPS guidance as a result of our strong second quarter and our positive outlook for the remainder of the year. I'll share those specifics with you in a little bit, but first let's go through some of the details on the quarter, starting on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today we reported second quarter revenue of 2 billion, an increase of 18%. Strong organic growth of 10% was complemented by acquisition growth of 12%. Partially offsetting these results was a 4% impact from dispositions and FX. EPS was a $1.04d, exceeding the high end of our expectations, principally reflecting strong conversion on higher revenue. Segment margin was 15%, 190 basis point improvement over last year, primarily driven by strong incremental margin on increased volume in our energy segment and by stronger performance in refrigeration and food equipment. Bookings increased 19% to 2 billion. This positive result reflecting organic growth in each segment is comprised of 12% organic growth and 11% acquisition growth, partially offset by a 4% impact of dispositions and FX. Book to bill finished at 1.01. Overall, our backlog increased 21% to 1.3 billion. On an organic basis, backlog increased 16%. Free cash flow was 150 million in the second quarter, a sequential increase of 115 million. We expect very strong free cash flow generation in the back half of the year consistent with our normal pattern. Now turning to Slide 4. Our strong organic growth was broad-based. Engineered systems grew 5% driven by solid activity across both platforms. Fluids organic revenue increased 4%, principally driven by solid retail fueling and strong industrial pump in pharma and hygienic markets. Refrigeration of food equipment increased 5% reflecting alignment with retail refrigeration customers who are investing. Lastly, energy grew 39% organically. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth was 34% in fluids and 10% in engineered systems. Turning to Slide 5. Engineers systems revenue of 655 million, was up 5% organically reflecting broad-based growth. Earnings increased 3% as volume leverage was moderated by investments and material cost inflation. Our printing and identification platform revenue increased 5% organically, driven by continued strength in our marking and coding markets. In the industrial platform, revenue increased 15% including acquisition growth of 17% and 5% organic growth. The organic growth was broad based with particular strength in our waste handling business. Margin was in line with our expectations, which included a 90 basis point impact from acquisitions. Bookings increased 14% overall, including organic bookings growth of 9%. Organic growth reflects solid markets across the segment. Book to bill for print and identification was 1.01, industrials was 0.97. Overall book to bill was 0.99. Now moving on to Slide 6. Fluids revenue increased 36% to 553 million reflecting our acquisitions and retail fueling and 4% organic growth. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by solid activity in retail fueling, especially in Europe and Asia and strong industrial pump in pharma and hygienic markets. Earnings increased 36%, largely driven by volume growth, including acquisitions and productivity gains. Of note, we have accelerated the pace of our retail fueling integration and now expect a 6 million net benefit for the year, up 3 million from our prior forecast. This will put us ahead of the pace for 2018 synergy benefits. Margin in the quarter was 13.3%, up 330 basis points sequentially representing meaningful progress in our retail fueling activities, including integration and commercial actions. Bookings grew 34%, driven by acquisitions in organic growth of 4%. Organic bookings growth was driven by solid activity in our pumps and our hygienic and pharma markets. Book to bill was 1.0. Now Turning to Slide 7. Refrigeration and food equipments revenue of 426 million included organic growth of 5%. The organic increase was largely driven by strong activity in our retail refrigeration business. We outperformed the border market on the strength of our alignment with customers who are investing in energy efficient solutions and enhanced fresh and prepared food merchandising. Food equipment results were in line with our expectations, with solid results in our can-shaping business more than offset softness in our commercial cooking equipment markets. Earnings increased 4% from the prior year or 8% on an adjusted basis, excluding the impact from a prior-year disposition. Margin expanded 70 basis points year-over-year and 600 basis points sequentially, reflecting improved execution and volume leverage offset in part by previously mentioned material cost inflation. Bookings increased 6% organically. Book to bill was solid at 1.09. Now on Slide 8. Energy revenue of 359 million increased 39% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Earnings were 53 million and segment margin was 14.9%, both significantly improved over last year. These results exceeded our prior forecasts largely driven by US rig count growth, increased well completion activity and strong results in bearings and compression. Bookings were up 43% year-over-year and 1% sequentially, setting us up for a solid third quarter. With respect to the third quarter, we expect revenue will be up about 1% to 2% sequentially. Book to bill finished at 0.98. Now going to the overview on Slide 9. Our second quarter corporate and interest expense were both essentially in line with expectations. Our second quarter tax rate was slightly higher than forecast at 28.9% and included 2.5 million of discrete tax costs. Excluding these costs, our effective tax rate was 27.8%. Now moving on to Slide 10. We now expect total revenue to increase 12% to 14% versus our prior forecast of 11% to 13%. This forecast includes organic revenue growth of 5% to 7%, up 1 point. The impact from completed acquisitions, dispositions and FX is essentially unchanged. From a segment perspective, organic growth of engineered systems and fluid are both being raised 1 point, driven by solid second quarter and broad-based bookings growth. Refrigeration and food equipment remains unchanged from our prior forecast. Energy is now expected to grow 24% to 27% organically, up 4 points over the last forecast, largely driven by strong second quarter growth and continuing constructive markets. Our full-year forecast for corporate expense is up 5 million, primarily on increased investments. We expect third and fourth quarter tax rate to be about 28%. Further our forecast for CapEx and free cash flow is unchanged. Lastly, we now expect full-year adjusted segment margin to be up slightly from our prior forecast. As a result, we now expect full-year EPS to be in the range of $4.23 and $4.33, up $0.15 from our prior forecast at the midpoint or an increase of 38% over 2016 on an adjusted basis. The revised guidance reflects increased second half performance and in all segments. Please note that our guidance bridge can be found in the appendix of our presentation deck. With that I'll turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments. Bob Livingston : Thanks Brad. I am very excited with our strong first half performance. All segments positively participated in our results through acquisitions, improving end markets or internal initiatives. Each segment had multiple drivers of performance improvement. Now let me take a minute to share my views on some of the important drivers that should positively impact our midterm performance. In engineered systems, our printing and identification platform will continue to deliver consist solid performance, driven by our focus on consumables and product innovation and marketing and coding and our unique position in the digital textile printing market. In our industrial platform, we have built leading positions in vehicle service and waste handling. Our focus in these markets is around providing full solutions rather than simply equipment. Within fluids, we expect to the EMV [ph] upgrade cycle in the US to accelerate starting in the second half of 2018. Along with that, our growing participation into hygienic and pharma, and industrial pump markets should provide for solid mid-digit growth in the segment. This growth will be complemented by margin expansion from our retail fueling integration and from the application of our operating model across the segment. In refrigeration and food equipment, the strengthen in our retail refrigeration business reflects our leading position in cases and systems, our technology around energy efficiency as well as our expertise helping our customers effectively merchandise fresh and prepared food. The retail food market continues to evolve and is shifting to these areas where we are the acknowledged leader. Finally, within energy, the significant drilling activity we've seen over the last few quarters has created a large backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells. We expect that many of these wells will get completed over the coming quarters and we will have strong participation in this activity. In all, our markets remain solid and I expect our execution to remain strong. With that I'd like to thank our entire Dover team for remaining focused on our customers. Now Paul let\u2019s take some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks Bob. Before we take the first question, I'd just like to remind the listeners if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up we\u2019d be able to get more questions. And so with that Stephanie, can we have the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Bob, could you pick up on the last point on drill but uncompleted wells and provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing there. Just eyeballing your book to bill and a little bit of backlog draw, some of which is not unusual seasonal, but it does kind of raise the question if this wave of drilling is going to be fully followed by kind of the wave of completions, which would seem to be necessary to carry your results into the back half. So any color there on the visibility that you have in that business and maybe the state of play on the number of wells and backlog et cetera could be helpful. Bob Livingston : Maybe I don't do it in the exact order you've asked the questions, Jeff. So let me start with the last question on the status of drilled but uncompleted wells. I don't have the data here in front of me, I did look at it a few days ago and I think the status of drilled and uncompleted wells at the end of the second quarter was a bit higher than it was at the end of the first quarter. Even though well completion activity did increase during the second quarter. The drilling activity has been rather robust during the second quarter. Our outlook for the second half of the year, Brad, you're going to help me here with a number. But I think for the second half of the year in drilling, our forecast assumes that rig count will be up.  I think it's rather modest 1% or 2% from where it is right today, Jeff. We're not forecasting much growth and further rig count deployment. We do continue to see the completion of wells continuing in the second half of the year. The activity in the Permian remains quite strong and in fact I think sequentially, June was up 15% over May, I don't remember what the data was, May over April, but I do know that June was up 15% over May in the Permian. And we feel fairly solid with our forecast for the second half of the year depending upon rig count, it could be conservative. Jeffrey Sprague : And just shifting gears to another topic. Refrigeration is up 5% organic in the first half. What gets us to up only 1 to 3 for the year, what's really happening in the back half? Brad Cerepak : I would start first by telling you that our first quarter was probably a bit stronger than we anticipated. Our second quarter was a bit stronger than we anticipated. Our bookings were strong during the quarter. June bookings were solid. I think we feel fairly comfortable and confident with our third quarter forecast. And I will tell you that sitting here today, I feel like we're being a bit conservative with our fourth quarter forecast. This was the only segment where we did not raise organic growth for the balance of the year. And Jeff, my color comment on that was the activity within this segment wanted to see a raise in organic growth in refrigeration and I would just tell you, I think we're being a bit conservative with our outlook for the fourth quarter and did not raise organic growth. But the activity sort of, today sort of warrants that, but I think we're being conservative. Paul Goldberg : Can we have the next question please? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question on, EMV and Wayne, it looks like its steady sequentially, but how should we model revenues in the second half of \u201917 and where are the orders trending for US fuel. How should we think about I guess the regulatory cycle. Bob Livingston : Well we shared - we shared the outlook over the next two to three years at our Investor Meeting in June. We do expect EMV in the activity in the second half of the year to moderate and to be less than we expected as we open the year. That said that's primarily a US comment. I would compliment that US comment by saying that for both Wayne and Tokheim, most notably at Tokheim, our revenue activity, our market activity in Europe, Middle East, Asia has been stronger than we anticipated both in the first quarter as well as a second quarter. And even though we see a little bit of moderation of activity in the US here in the second half, I would be remiss by not sharing the fact that our earnings for the year are remaining as we have held since we opened the year, we have strong earnings potential. Andrew Obin : And that's a question on cash flow. As I look at the first half cash flow and it makes perfect sense given where the organic growth is for the business so far year-to-date, but 140 million versus 170 million last year, but you are calling for a very strong cash conversion, 140% for the year. If organic growth continue, how do you get working capital out of the company with strong organic growth. Brad Cerepak : So let me take that question. You do point out quite correctly that in the quarter we had very strong organic and total growth as well at 18%. So, working capital did increase, net about 50 million in the quarter with AR being about 100 million up. So, given the sequence within the quarter, with June being the largest part of the quarter's results, gives me some confidence that as we go into the back half that receivables will be collected. Now let me comment on inventory because I think this is an important point. We did see our inventory; we said this in the first quarter.  We continued to carry into the second quarter with inventory increase of about 50 million more than we would have expected principally driven by a few areas, one being as we referred to before to better manage our peak periods of production flow in refrigeration, we increased some inventory there. That will burn off in the second half. We also selectively increased inventory as we started to see some material cost inflation in very specific areas, not broad based, but very specific areas. So all in all about 50 million of inventory builds over above where we would have expected that I have full confidence will burn off in the second half. Bob Livingston : Brad, the only other comment I will make there is on working capital as a percentage of our revenue. I actually think we're at the lowest working capital number as a percentage of revenue since I've been CEO. Brad Cerepak : Well, longer than that. Bob Livingston : Longer than that, yeah. So it was a record low of 17.6% in the quarter, which shows really the guys are doing a great job on looking at and managing our working capital in total. Brad Cerepak : Andrew, we feel quite comfortable with our cash flow forecast for the balance of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : So I just want to pick up on Andrew\u2019s points on Wayne. Is the second half pretty much tracking to you know how you saw with maybe two months ago. I think you mentioned perhaps that the first half was a litter bit stronger second half but weaker than back in June. I just wonder if that dynamic has changed at all. Bob Livingston : I think the comments \u2013 well, you say two months ago, let me refer to my comments that we shared with all of you at our June Investor Conference. And I think the second half is shaping up fairly close to what we - to the color we shared at the June investor conference. EMV activity is down in the second half relative to what we expected coming into the year. And again that's a US comment, but I will tell you it's - we are very, very pleased with the activity of both Wayne and Tokheim outside of the US. And we actually feel, we actually feel quite good with the commercial activity and the integration activity within this platform. Nigel Coe : And then switching back to energy Bob, this mix between drilling and production, so I\u2019m just wondering, as these ducts start to complete, that 1% to 2% higher revenue in 3Q, is the mix between drilling and production materially different to what we\u2019ve seen in the first half of the year, 2Q and do you think you can actually grow margins sequentially on the back of them? Bob Livingston : Yeah. We\u2019ll see a bit of a tapering in the growth in our drilling activity. Actually, I would maybe rephrase it. I think we will see more than a bit of tapering in the growth of our drilling activity. But offsetting that, we do expect growth in well completion activity that will be recognized by our artificial lift in our automation businesses. Brad Cerepak : But specific to margin, off of the second quarter rate, we do expect to expand that margin in the back half on energy. Nigel Coe : Sequentially? Brad Cerepak : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Charley Brady : Just wondered if you could comment on the Amazon Whole Foods merger as it relates to the refrigeration food equipment business and kind of some of the consolidation that's going on, taking place in there, and maybe how it affects your view of that business long term. Bob Livingston : Okay. Well, there's two parts. So the consolidation within the industry, goodness, we've been seeing that occur for several years now and of course, when it does, when company A and company B go together, it's not uncommon for us to see a bit of a pause, while the combined business decides what they\u2019re going to do with respect to remodel or new store construction. But that's sort of normal for this industry. The first part of your question, with respect to Amazon and Whole Foods, my answer is not going to surprise you. We're not seeing any change right now and there really hasn't been any communication that we've received from either of the two that would lead us to believe that it's going to have any impact on our business. Charley Brady : Great. Thanks. And just as a quick follow-up, just I want to clarify the comment on the Tokheim business in Europe, so you're saying that that European business is the strength there to fully offset the softening you're seeing in EMV in the second half? Bob Livingston : Yes. In fact, let me clarify that. It's not just Tokheim. It\u2019s Tokheim and Wayne, seeing better activity in Europe, the Middle East and Asia that is truly offsetting a little bit of the softness we're seeing in the second half with respect to EMV activity. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Bob, so clearly the chassis issues that you had in waste handling seem to be behind you. So how do we think about your overall industrial business within energy and engineered solutions going forward? Can you sustain mid-single digit organic growth and then you mentioned last quarter that waste handling could be up high single digits for the year. Do you see that kind of growth potential for that business? Bob Livingston : Well, I'm going to give you both a comment for the year and then echo what we shared with everyone at our June investor conference. The growth we've seen in the first half, especially in the second quarter, we see it continuing in the second half. In fact, relative to our guidance, it's going to edge up a bit. Our waste handling, our [indiscernible] management business is performing well. The chassis issue is behind us. That business built revenue during the quarter with, I would say, June being, I think, it was a record shipping month in June for that business. And the outlook for the second half of the year for that business is as solid as we've been signaling all year long. It is high single digit growth in that business for the year. The other comment I would share is beyond 2017 and this is what we shared at the Investor Conference a few weeks ago, we see the industrial platform is having strong mid digit growth -- organic growth for the next two to three years and we think we're in a very good market position. We think we're in a very good technology position and it's not just waste handling, it's across the platform. Andrew Kaplowitz : Bob, that\u2019s helpful. And then, can you talk about your appetite for bigger portfolio management, specifically how that -- how you're thinking about energy now. When you look at rig counts, they have shot up faster than really anyone expected. There\u2019s been some oil price volatility here, which leads to some fear that rig counts are peaking. Does that incentivize you at all to potentially try and monetize energy faster, how are you thinking about it right now? Bob Livingston : Look, I think that's at least the third question that I've had this year on energy and our portfolio inclusion. And my answer, I\u2019m smiling when I say this. And my answer is really the same. This is -- we've built a great position with these businesses around our upstream energy portfolio. We did expect strong growth in these businesses this year. We've seen it. We'll see how the second quarter or the second half performs. I happen to think we may be slightly conservative on that second half guide. And it is that and other topics that are similar to this is something that Brad and I do review with our board on a very periodic basis. I have no other new news to share with you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Steve Tusa : Good execution in the quarter. Definitely, all these issues of the last year or so or a year and a half ago are pretty much, look like they're remedied. So congrats on the execution. Bob Livingston : Thank you. I appreciate that and the teams have done a good job. Steve Tusa : Yeah. So on the energy business, so it looks like organic is up about mid-20s in the second half on the top line. Rig count year-over-year is up pretty dramatic, up I think like 70%, 80%, given the easy comps year-over-year, assuming a stable, assuming so. So is there any way to kind of give us the variability around, what if rigs were actually down, what would your revenue kind of -- what is the revenue profile of like how much that completion activity comes on to offset. So I'm thinking more kind of on a 12-month basis, if rigs were down year-over-year, is there enough duct activity out there, what -- I guess the question is, at what rate of rig decline and kind of over a 12 to 18 month period, would you still be able to grow the business, given the significant completion activity that's out there. How are you kind of thinking about that as you plan for the next year? Bob Livingston : Steve, I don't have enough time remaining on this call to give you a complete answer to that. So let me, okay, I really want to do this. Steve Tusa : Yeah. I guess let me simplify. Let me simplify this, is given the complexion of what you expect on completions and all these may get an \u201918 question, I mean I know you guys don\u2019t want to give guidance, but if rigs were down 10% year-over-year in \u201918, 10%, what do you think your kind of -- can you backfill that with completion activity and still grow the business? Bob Livingston : If rigs were down 10%, the well completion activity could very easily offset the decline we would see in our drilling activity. And we -- as -- we have done that analysis and if the price of oil remain constructive in the $45 to $50 area, we actually think we could have modest increase in revenue for the segment. Steve Tusa : Okay. That's a great answer. And also just the mix of margins would obviously be a little bit different, right, because drilling is \u2013 Bob Livingston : Somewhat, but not dramatically. Steve Tusa : Okay. That\u2019s a really great answer. And then lastly, just on energy, what do you -- did you change at all your margin expectations. What's the margin you expect for the full year? Bob Livingston : Oh gosh. I don't have that data with me. I don't think from the margin expectations from our April call, the answer is no. In fact, they may have edged up 20 or 30 bps, 40bps from the April call expectation. Brad Cerepak : No. I think they're up a little bit more than that. I think our expectations now are up about somewhere around 80 bps. Bob Livingston : 80 bps. Steve Tusa : Okay. And that\u2019s 80 bps from where you were, from where you had originally guided? Brad Cerepak : That\u2019s right. Steve Tusa : Okay. One last quick question, on refrigeration and food, you got like 2.5% price, 2.4% price. Where did that come from? What drove that? Brad Cerepak : So some of it is material surcharges, offsetting the material inflation we've seen in the first half of the year. And in fact, I think in the second half of the year, the price increases -- and the price increases are done by the way. They were done at the end of the first quarter and coming into the second quarter. I actually think the price increases we've seen in that segment negate the material inflation that you would -- that we would receive as an input cost in the second half of the year. Steve Tusa : Is that a new mechanism for you guys? Brad Cerepak : Some of it is also strategic pricing, Steve, but we have been very aggressive on material surcharge pricing. Steve Tusa : Is that a new mechanism that you guys have put in place, because I recall this business was a little bit more pinched historically? So that's kind of something you guys have done as a reaction to kind of the last ten years of kind of history or whatever it is, where you know you're just kind of operating smarter? Brad Cerepak : I'm not sure it's 10 years, but I would say the last five or six for sure. Yes. And it is new. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Mircea Dobre with Baird. Mircea Dobre : Just wanted to ask a question on optics rather than content, so for several years no, energy was typically the first segment discussed in your slides, it was the first segment discussed in Q. Now we've seen the second move at the end and obviously performance here is quite good. So I'm just wondering as to why this change has been made, what should we interpret that as and why now? Brad Cerepak : Well, I guess the biggest reason for that -- my answer is I was a bit bored. So for four years now, the order of the presentation has been alphabetical. I just decided to change it. Actually, we started to change it with our June investor conference and we just moved it from large to small. It's just as simple. Mircea Dobre : Okay. All right. So I shouldn\u2019t read anything else in it? Brad Cerepak : I'm just bored. Mircea Dobre : Okay. And then my follow-up, maybe talking a little bit about engineered, sort of a guidance question for the second half. Performance here has been good, north of 3% organic for revenue in the front half. The bookings have grown organically double digits and yet your revenue guidance is only 3% to 4% organically for the year and the comps really aren\u2019t getting tougher. So I'm wondering if it's the same level of conservatism as to what you apply in our revenue or if there's something else I should be thinking about. Bob Livingston : Look, I have pointed out, I guess with two segments, both refrigeration and energy that our guide for the second half could be conservative. I'd like to think on that way for the entire group of segments for Dover. Don't read anything into, don't read anything into disparities here at Engineered Systems for the second half. We've got a fairly strong third quarter planned. I think across the board, we've taken a bit of a conservative attitude towards the fourth quarter and we just have a lot of delight with what's going on in engineered systems. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. John Inch : I guess I have a question about the font you used in your presentation. Bob Livingston : I'm not going to answer that one. Brad Cerepak : Don't imply anything by the size of the font. John Inch : That was a cheap shot, but I couldn't resist. Okay. The performance, including restructuring this year, the $1.36 to $1.40, Brad, can you remind us how much of that you say it's including restructuring benefits, how much of the restructuring benefits again in 2017 and are there a spillover that you could quantify that go into \u201918? Brad Cerepak : Oh gosh. Okay. But restructuring benefits, I think last time we said within that line item, the restructuring benefits would be about 46 million, which included carryover from the prior year 2016. Now given the acceleration that we're talking about with respect to the integration with DFS and other activities, we're now at about 52 million, so up 6 million of restructuring benefits. At this point, I really don't have a good number of the carry over into \u201918, but certainly we're going to continue to see the continuing impact of the integration activity where we said 35 plus million I think, we were thinking. It wants to go higher and we\u2019re not seeing a lot of that right now in 2017, because of the costs. The delta between the benefits and the cost being about 6 million, that continues to grow into those out years, so that you can count on. John Inch : Yeah. That makes sense. Bob, what were your comments around EMV in \u201918, I missed it. You were talking about EMV picking up significantly in \u201918. What\u2019s the framework in context of that again please? Bob Livingston : To be specific, we shared this at our June investor conference that we do expect some slowdown and softness and EMV roll-out here in the US in the second half of \u201917 and in the first half of \u201918. But we do expect that EMV activity to start to pick up in a measurable way in the second half of \u201918. John Inch : So that makes sense. So that's just basically the anniversarying of the soft patch because of the push out in spite of the deadlines, are customers kind of giving you that feedback? I mean, obviously your primary competitor is sort of saying the big oil companies are still spending and what, I'm just trying to understand how kind of hard and fast some of these estimates sort of are, so \u2013 Bob Livingston : Yeah. I would agree with that. Our larger customers, the oil companies and some of the larger chains have continued with their EMV upgrades, especially in the first half, but those commitments were made by the customers in the October-November-December timeframe of last year and they have continued with their EMV upgrades and we still see continuing EMV upgrades in the second half. It hasn't fallen to zero. It's just not as strong as we would have expected eight months ago. But the input we're getting from customers is, they can defer it a year and many of them are deciding to do that. John Inch : That makes sense. If we go back to earlier in the year, you were cautioning against getting too crazy in terms of us forecasting too high a variable contribution margins for energy and I think one of the commentaries was, look, we might have to put back or layer in some cost. So I guess I'm wondering is that still sort of valid, I mean, you did really great variable contribution margins this quarter and the context I'm sort of trying to understand is, as the rig counts kind of swap the baton with well completion, is there something about the mix of those activities or sort of absorbing fixed costs that naturally would cause for variable contribution kind of rates if you will to ebb against this notion of, I do actually have to hire people back because the business is just really good. Bob Livingston : No. I understand your question. So I would tell you that we did especially in our drilling inserts business, we did see cost added in the first quarter. We saw some additional cost added in the second quarter, and in the second quarter, we did make a conscious decision that we wanted to bring our lead times and our delivery cycles back in. We divide and stretch a little bit, but we\u2019re willing to bring them back in. Within artificial lift, the bulk of the cost adds here in the first half of the year, I don't want to say all of it, but it has been primarily related and restricted to cost adds around our ESP business. In the second half of the year, as we expect well completion activity to pick up a bit, we will have to add some cost in other parts of artificial lift. John Inch : And just last, our energy, so all this opining about divesting energy, what about the prospect of doing an energy deal or two maybe in -- maybe in the submersible pump business or something like that, is that off the table and if so why would it be? Bob Livingston : Well, that question has been asked before and I -- my response -- my response over the last six or nine months has been, look, what we have today and especially in artificial lift and automation, it reflects the strategy that we laid out in \u201909 and \u201910 to build this upstream business and we were really focused around artificial lift. And if you look at where our spending on acquisitions has been over the last six years, Brad, over the last six years, within this segment, gosh, I think 90% of it has been in artificial lift. We actually feel we're pretty much done with larger deals in the upstream business. There is always a smaller opportunity or two that we look at. We're looking at one or two right now that would help us expand our capability, especially around technology or geo in artificial lift. But you shouldn't -- you shouldn't expect us to be spending any significant M&A dollars in our upstream energy business next quarter, the following quarter or next year. John Inch : Yeah. Just wasn\u2019t sure if the thought had maybe changed, considering the industry has rebounded to the degree it has. Bob Livingston : No. I think if you're going to see anything of any, I call it, reportable size within upstream, you'd see us execute on something around automation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : Yes. Back to energy and I may have missed this, but can you comment on the contribution from price across the business by drilling and production and bearings and automation. Bob Livingston : Okay. My comment, my lead comment on price for energy for the second quarter is that it was neutral. Maybe, it was what, a positive 0.5% or something, which is called neutral. We actually do expect a little bit of a price increase activity in the second half, Deane. I would label it as very specific, very modest and most of what we're looking at right now is to offset the increased costs we're seeing on some steel input. Deane Dray : And then when I look at the book to bill just under 1 and I'm trying to reconcile that with the comments and the nice things you're saying about bearings and compression growth in the quarter. Since that's a bit longer cycle, I would have thought you would have seen that come through in higher bookings and I know on an absolute basis, bookings were up big, but why wouldn't that have been reflected in a higher book to bill? Bob Livingston : I just wouldn\u2019t read anything to it. I think it's just all a matter of timing. We had an outstanding quarter at bearings and compression in the second quarter. The revenue and earnings were a bit higher than we had anticipated, coming into the quarter. And it's -- that business is pretty much a book and ship business. It just doesn't carry a lot of backlog. Operator : Your next question is from Nathan Jones with Stifel. Nathan Jones : If we could start with some of these investments, you called out engineering and corporate investments, are there an increased level of investments going on in other segments? Is this, maybe you\u2019re catching up on some stuff that you'd scaled back in the last couple of years when demand wasn't great and how you're thinking about making some of these, what I assume are more voluntary investments going forward? Bob Livingston : No. At the segment level, I think the only significant investment that we've called out and we did that early in the year, I think on the, at our January meeting and our January call was within engineered systems and we did make a very conscious decision late last year as we come into 2017 to increase some investment spending, we call it investment spending, it's the P&L around the build out of our digital textile business and a little bit more, little bit of an increase in product development spending and innovation spending within our marketing and coating business. But if you look at the other three segments, yes, I mean we've increased spending, but it was not along the lines of warranting a call out, like we did at engineered systems. With respect to -- your other comment was with respect to what corporate and it is up a bit this year. We have increased our spending around IT security. We've increased some spending around IT infrastructure. And we're carrying a little bit more of expense at corporate right now with respect to helping us manage our digital rollout. Nathan Jones : Okay. And then just in the fluids business, you\u2019ve obviously seen a big pickup in the short cycle energy business, some of your long cycle energy business that\u2019s hitting fluids, have you seen any change in trends in that business there. Bob Livingston : So within, this is specific to pumps, correct? Nathan Jones : Yes. Bob Livingston : All right. Within the pumps, I would say the only thing that we've noticed in pumps with respect to our longer cycle oil and gas exposure is that we have seen throughout the year, it was more noticeable in the second quarter than it was in the first. We have seen an increase in pump activity, especially in the Permian. But that's not what was driving the 4% organic growth in the second quarter and I\u2019m sitting here today, I will tell you that's not what's driving our increased outlook for fluids in the second half of the year. It really is an increased activity in, what I would call, industrial applications and continuing increased activity in the hygienic and pharma. Operator : At this time, we have time for one additional question. Your next question is from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Scott Graham : I have one question and seven follow-ups. My primary question is about the fueling and transport business. And, I know the part of the idea behind acquiring Wayne was to build your critical mass, not just in EMV, but really also away from the EMV, that portion of the business and what gets this business growing, when does that critical mass start to be brought upon the market to accelerate the growth away from EMV? Bob Livingston : Oh, I think we're seeing it this year. As we have, I think shared at least once last year and a couple of times this year, we see the -- we see that retail -- we see that retail fueling market as a sort of -- as a baseline globally, growing something like 3% a year. And then, you have some, I call it, special cycles that you add to it, EMV being one of them. And we\u2019ll experience that in 2017. Don't lose sight of the fact, don't lose sight of the fact that within fueling and transport, which includes OPW that there's a business within OPW that provides components and hardware for the railroads. And that rail business is actually down about 20% this year. And we have been talking about that and signaling that for the past, I don't know Brad, four or five quarters, but it will continue to be down this year and it is a headwind for that fueling and transport business. The other parts of fueling and transport I think are doing quite well. Scott Graham : My follow up is simple, the pumps business. We saw some nice organic growth in that business. Did you see anything in any specific end market that was the driver there? I know the comparison was easy, but still up 6 is up 6 and just kind of wondering what was the driver there. Bob Livingston : Well, I\u2019ve sort of commented on that from an application point of view, it was General Industrial. It was hygienic and pharma and the only other color I would add to that, it was very broad based from a geographic expansion. We saw growth here in US, North America, Europe and China and Asia. It was quite broad based. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : Thanks, Stephanie. I just wanted to thank everybody for joining us today on the conference call. We thank you for your interest in Dover and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Have a good day and a good weekend. Thanks. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s second quarter 2017 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Bob Livingston : Thanks Paul. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for this morning\u2019s conference call. Our third quarter performance reflected continued strong global markets resulting in organic growth at each segment. In particular, we had strong organic growth across several platforms, including digital printing, waste handling, bearings and compression, and pumps. We also had solid performances in a number of other platforms including marking and coding, retail fueling and retail refrigeration. In all Dover\u2019s organic growth was 9% in the quarter. In total, our revenue and margin expansion were largely in line with our expectations. In addition, our strong bookings growth sets us up for a solid finish to this year. I am pleased that we are firmly on track to deliver on the three-year plan we outlined in June, we expect solid organic growth and margin improvement this year, and we are positioned to deliver further growth and margin expansion in 2018. I\u2019m also encouraged by our portfolio work to drive long-term success and value creation. We have continued to simplify our portfolio and invest in market-leading platforms that have strong market positions and margin profiles. In addition to the planned wellsite separation we recently signed an agreement to sell the consumer and industrial winch business of Warn for $250 million and expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter. Regarding wellsite, we are continuing the process of evaluating our options for separation, the process is moving along well and before we expect to announce our plans by year end. Within wellsite markets have remained quite constructive and we are on track to hit our 2017 forecast of $1 billion in revenue and $250 million in EBITDA. We are committed to pursuing the transaction that is best for the business and also creates the greatest value for our shareholders. While our portfolio simplification activities advance, we have continued to build the pipeline with targets that enhance and expand our growth platforms. I am very pleased with our execution on the topline this year and I\u2019m encouraged that we\u2019ve made progress on margins. As we enter the fourth quarter and continue working on the wellsite separation, we are actively reviewing our cost structure to rightsize our company and improve margins. This review was broad-based, excluding wellsite, with the goal of achieving $40 million of cost savings for 2018. The goal of all of these actions is a focused and consistent portfolio with a sustainable runway for revenue growth and margin improvement. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we had a very solid third quarter. We achieved organic revenue growth in all segments and had organic bookings growth in three of our segments. Leverage on this organic growth combined with the benefits of integration led to solid year-over-year margin improvement. Overall, adjusted margin was 13% -- 15.3%. There were several highlights in the quarter, including broad-based revenue and bookings growth in Engineered Systems, strong revenue and bookings growth in Fluids, along with continued sequential margin improvement, continued organic growth and year-over-year margin improvement in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, and lastly, strong broad-based revenue and bookings growth in Energy. Also from a geographic perspective, U.S., Europe and China markets all grew organically year-over-year. Our full year EPS guidance remains unchanged. Importantly, this guidance does not include anticipated gain on the sale of Warn, fourth quarter costs associated with the wellsite separation or any incremental rightsizing costs. We record these items as the disposition is completed and as cost of the separation and rightsizing are incurred. Now let\u2019s go through some details on the quarter, starting on slide three of the presentation deck. Today we reported third quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 17%, organic growth of 9% was complemented by acquisition growth of 10%. Partially offsetting these results was a 3% impact from prior dispositions. Adjusted EPS increased 40% to a $1.16. This result excludes $0.02 of disposition and wellsite separation related costs in the quarter. Adjusted segment margin was 15.3%, 120 basis point improvement over last year, primarily driven by incremental margin on increased volume. Bookings increased 14% to $1.9 billion. This result was comprised of 7% organic growth and acquisition growth of 10%, partially offset by a 3% impact of prior dispositions and reflects strong growth in Engineered Systems, Fluids and Energy. Book-to-bill finished at 0.97. Overall, our backlog increased 18% to $1.3 billion. On an organic basis backlog increased 12%. Free cash flow was $214 million in the quarter, a sequential increase of $64 million. We expect very strong free cash flow generation in the fourth quarter consistent with our normal pattern. Now turning to slide four, organic growth was broad-based. Engineered Systems grew 7% driven by solid activity across both platforms. Fluids organic revenue increased 5% principally driven by solid retail fueling and strong industrial pump in pharma and hygienic markets. Refrigeration & Food Equipment increased 2% and Energy grew 31% organically. As seen on the chart, acquisition growth was 30% in Fluids and 8% in Engineered Systems. Now turning to slide five. Engineered Systems revenue of $646 million was up 7% organically reflecting broad-based growth. Adjusted earnings increased 5% over the prior year as volume leverage was partially offset by the impact of investments and material cost inflation. Our printing and identification platform revenue increased 4% organically, driven by continued strong growth in digital printing and solid activity in our marking and coding markets. In the industrial platform, revenue increased 18%, including acquisition growth of 14% and 9% organic growth. The organic growth was broad-based with strong performance in waste handling. Margin was slightly below our expectations, reflecting the timing of investments and modest material cost inflation. Bookings increased 10% overall, including organic bookings growth of 3%. Organic growth reflects solid activity across the segment. Book-to-bill for each of the platforms and overall for the segment was 0.98. Now on slide six. Fluids revenue increased 36% to $563 million, reflecting acquisition growth of 30% and 5% organic growth. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by strong industrial pump and hygienic and pharma markets, as well as solid retail fueling activity. Earnings increased 32%, largely driven by volume growth, including acquisitions and productivity gains. Our retail fueling integration continues to be on track, supporting a strong sequential margin improvement. In all, margin was 15.5%, up 220 basis points sequentially. Bookings grew 39%, driven by acquisitions and 10% organic growth. Organic bookings growth was broad-based. Book-to-bill was 1.02. Now on slide seven. Refrigeration & Food Equipments revenue of $439 million included organic growth of 2%. Organic -- the organic increase was largely driven by solid activity in Refrigeration. Food Equipment results reflect a continued softness in our commercial cooking equipment markets. Earnings increased 2% from the prior year or 7% when excluding the impact from a prior disposition. Margin expanded 70 basis points year-over-year reflecting volume leverage offset in part by business mix. Bookings decreased 11% organically, reflecting a general slowdown in our retail refrigeration markets and the timing of orders in can-shaping machinery. But you know our can-shaping business is expected to have a very strong fourth quarter as we ship against orders booked earlier in the year. Book-to-bill was 0.82. Moving to slide eight. Energy revenue increased 32% to $359 million, reflecting growth in the U.S. rig count and increased well completion activity. Earnings were $52 million and segment margin was 14.5%, both significantly improved over last year. These results were largely driven by year-over-year improvements in the U.S. rig count, increased well completion activity and continued strong results in bearings and compression, which grew 9%. As Bob mentioned, our wellsite business had a strong quarter with 39% revenue growth and we are on track to achieve the full year forecast. We expect fourth quarter segment revenue to reflect modest sequential growth. Bookings were up 36% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. Book-to-bill finished at 1.04. Going to the overview on slide nine. Our third quarter corporate expense included $2 million of wellsite-related separation costs. Interest expense was in line with expectations. Our third quarter tax rate was 24.6%. This rate reflects increases due to changes in geographic mix of earnings, which were more than offset by discrete tax benefits. The net result of these items was a $0.04 EPS benefit. Moving on to slide 10 which shows our 2017 guidance. We now expect total revenue to increase 14% to 15% versus our prior forecast of 12% to 14%. Within this forecast, organic revenue growth is 6% to 7%. The impact from completed acquisitions is unchanged at approximately 10%. The full year impact from FX is now expected to be neutral up 1 point from the last forecast. From a segment perspective, organic growth is largely unchanged from our prior guidance. Our full year forecast for corporate expense is $133 million and now includes $2 million of wellsite costs incurred in the third quarter, interest expense is unchanged and we expect the fourth quarter tax rate to be about 28%. Our forecast for CapEx remains unchanged and the full year free cash flow is expected to be 10% to 11% of revenue. In summary, our full year EPS guidance of $4.23 to $4.33 is unchanged. As previously mentioned, this guidance does not include the anticipated gain on the Warn disposition, which is estimated at approximately $230 million net of tax and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. It also does not include any fourth quarter costs related to wellsite separation. And lastly, it does not include any rightsizing costs currently estimated to be about $40 million to $45 million. At the midpoint, our EPS guidance represents an increase of 39% over 2016 on an adjusted basis. Please note that our guidance bridge can be found in the appendix of our presentation deck. With that, let me turn the call back over to Bob. Bob Livingston : Thanks, Brad. Throughout the year all segments have grown nicely and we had gain share in several of the markets we served. Additionally, we have made progress on several of our initiatives to drive margin expansion. For instance, our retail fueling integration is on pace and sequential margin expansion in Fluids has been strong. Retail refrigeration margins have also grown on improved productivity. Looking forward, we have multiple opportunities to outgrow the broader market. Here are just a few. Our unique position in the fast-growing digital textile printing market is providing us a strong growth opportunity. We see the penetration rate of digital technology climbing to 30% over the next 10 years from the 3% to 4% rate of today. Our comprehensive solutions, including equipment, ink and software positions us very well to full leverage this technology shift. Within retail fueling we expect the EMV upgrade cycle in the U.S. to accelerate as our customers began preparing for compliance with payment regulations that go into effect in 2020. Along with that, our growing offering of remote monitoring and software-as-a-service provides ample opportunity for strong growth. In Refrigeration we expect food retailers to invest in closed-door refrigeration cases, energy efficient systems and in specialized display cases, as they look to manage operating cost and differentiate themselves in the market. In these product categories we have a leading position. Finally, within our industrial pumps business, the worldwide growth of plastic usage and our customers\u2019 desire for improved efficiency plays to the strengths of this platform. We have the leading position in pelletizers and other polymer processing equipment due to our higher output, faster changeovers and more compact designs. These growth drivers coupled with our margin improvement initiatives provides a very positive framework for the next several years. And in closing, I\u2019d like to thank our entire Dover team for remaining focused on our customers. And with that, Paul, let\u2019s take some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks. Before we take our first question, I just want to remind everybody, if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, we will get more questions in. So, with that, let\u2019s have the first question, Paula. Operator : Okay. Your first question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Nigel. Nigel Coe : So just want to -- hi -- hi, guys. Just want to kick off with ES margins. They came in -- you mentioned, your margin came in more or less in line with your expectation. But just wondering about the impact, if you could maybe just define the impact of raw material inflation and on that topic, I know that the pricing ES improved from 0.3% to 0.5% from 2Q to 3Q. I am just wondering what actions you are taking on pricing to offset that raw mat inflation? Bob Livingston : The material inflation, Nigel, in the third quarter for Engineered Systems was a little bit higher than we had expected coming into the quarter. You do appropriately note the price increases both second quarter and third quarter, and I would love to have seen more of a price increase in the third quarter and I know the guys are working on that here for the fourth quarter and going into 2018. But the -- I -- at the end of the day even though I say margins overall came in largely in line with our expectations. Margins at Engineered Systems to be frank were a bit disappoint and they should be better. Nigel Coe : Okay. But it sounds like you\u2019re trying to get pricing pushed through the channel. Bob Livingston : Yes. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then you mentioned obviously in the PR that the process for wellsite is on track. Are you -- given the cost you incurred during the quarter, are you pursuing essentially a dual track process where you are preparing for spin but open to other options, so that if you do decide to spin in December that the process could be relatively quick from there on? Bob Livingston : We are managing a dual track process. We have been -- we\u2019ve got a rather robust work extreme internally, as well as with our outside advisors to prepare us for a spin process and if we get to year end and declare that our separation process will be a spin, we would expect the spin to be completed before the end of the second quarter. Nigel Coe : Okay, Bob. That\u2019s great. Thanks. I will leave you there. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Steve Tusa : Hi, guys. Good morning. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Steve. Brad Cerepak : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Can you just talk about -- I heard you say some about $40 million and I believe it was cost savings for next year, but obviously, there is some stranded stuff if you spin or sell. You mentioned that you are going to spend some money here in the fourth quarter, that\u2019s not yet in guidance. Can you maybe just kind of tie those things together and just reminds us what\u2019s new and what\u2019s not in the bridge? Bob Livingston : Okay. Well, I\u2019ll let Brad deal with the bridge. So the -- first off, I would -- let me respond to your comment about stranded cost. If we were to assume that the separation plan for wellsite is a spin. Steve, the cost connected with wellsite as it operates today within Dover and the segment cost are going to move almost 100% with the spin. So the stranded cost to me is actually a de minimis number. That said look at as we look at moving into 2018 absent wellsite, it is a smaller revenue base. On a pro forma basis we expect and will deliver improved margins in 2018 over 2017, and we are looking where -- as my prepared comment pointed out, it\u2019s a very broad-based review of all areas of Dover excluding wellsite and we have -- today we believe we\u2019ve got rough line of sight to about $40 million of savings that would show up in 2018 and I think Brad commented on the cost that we would incur to execute on capturing those savings and it\u2019s about $40 million to 45 million. Here is the problem I have with the $40 million to 45 million and it\u2019s one of timing. We still have some projects to approve here over the next two weeks to three weeks. We have internal communications to rollout. I\u2019m not sure sitting here today that we will end up booking that entire $40 million to $45 million of cost into the fourth quarter, some of those cost may very well bleed into the first quarter. Do you want to\u2026 Steve Tusa : Yeah. Got it. Brad Cerepak : So\u2026 Steve Tusa : Yeah. Brad Cerepak : So, Steve, just to clarify the bridge, because it\u2019s still a work in progress. Steve Tusa : Yeah. Brad Cerepak : I think we are confident on the $40 million of benefits. We are not as confident as the split on the cost side, but a loin share of it will be in the fourth quarter based upon what we know today and it is not in the bridge, so\u2026 Steve Tusa : And that\u2019s above and beyond, what you\u2019re getting from the restruct -- base restructuring you are already doing. Brad Cerepak : Absolutely. Bob Livingston : Yes. Brad Cerepak : So the base restructuring previously we\u2019ve been talking about $18 million to $20 million. We are still -- that base restructuring still ongoing, which gives us over $40 million. That\u2019s -- that generates benefits for us in the current year of about $47 million. There will be some carryover into \u201818 on that as well. Steve Tusa : Okay. Just one quick question on the -- to follow up on Nigel\u2019s question on the, I think, it\u2019s Engineered business. Anything kind of the distribution channel and product ID that may be influencing margins there, I know your peer reported and margins there were not may be just little bit mixed. Anything going on in PID to kind of stands out from a margin perspective? Brad Cerepak : No. The -- from a marking and coding perspective, we had a very good third quarter with marking and coding. We are continuing to make some investments within our digital print business and that\u2019s for 2017. Help me with this number. I think it\u2019s about $5 million or $6 million of incremental investment that will not continue and will not repeat in 2018. But with respect to marking and coding it was a pretty solid quarter and no\u2026 Steve Tusa : Got it. Bob Livingston : To answer your specific question, no issues with distribution. Steve Tusa : Okay. One last quick one, sorry, Paul, I know you are going to call me for this. Bob, with all this movement around the portfolio, you obviously, had a nice run here, you\u2019ve done a lot at the company and changed it quite a bit. Is there any kind of a step -- further step forward in kind of succession planning, I mean, clearly, the company has changed a lot, you have done a lot of heavy lifting and anything to discuss on the succession planning side? Bob Livingston : The answer is no, other than I would repeat what I\u2019ve said before with other questions on this topic. The Board and I run and have been running a rather robust process around succession planning. I think the Board feels quite comfortable with it. We are -- we do not anticipate a near-term change. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Bob Livingston : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, guys. Bob Livingston : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Hi. Bob Livingston : And welcome back. Brad Cerepak : Welcome back here again. Scott Davis : Thank you. Sounds like Steve trying to get you to retire Bob. Bob Livingston : Yeah. Might be. I think that as well, Scott. Scott Davis : I am just joking. I just had -- I was curious your comment about dual tracking the Energy business is interesting, but is there a scenario where you could sell pieces of Energy and spin the rest. I mean there are some real gems in there? Bob Livingston : That\u2019s not. Scott Davis : [Inaudible] (27:39). Bob Livingston : I won\u2019t say, no, to anything, but I don\u2019t see that -- truly I don\u2019t see that being one of the outcomes. Scott Davis : Okay. And then on the Refrigeration business when you showed a couple book-to-bill 0.82, I mean, I think, most of us knew that market was getting a little bit softer. But is some of that reflected in the fact you guys have just been cutting your SKUs that kind of redefine your market a little bit? Is there any way to parse that out? Bob Livingston : No. Not, look, we\u2019ve actually been asking that question ourselves. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s having an impact with our customers or with the business. It\u2019s been a very odd year, Scott, within this segment. We typically have, my goodness, for years have historically seen the second quarter and the third quarter being the high points for this segment with the two shoulder seasons, the first quarter and the fourth quarter being light. We saw the change starting to occur with this segment and the order rates in the fourth quarter of last year, we had very strong organic growth in the first two quarters of this year. And the questions on every call this year so far had been, well, why aren\u2019t you raising your guide on the Refrigeration segment with respect to the topline. And part of our concern is that we knew we were a bit frontloaded in the first half of this year with respect to some customer activity, most notably around some of the cutover on the DOE regulations. We just did not know what we were going to see definitively in the second half. I fully expect 2018 to return this segment to a more seasonal and normal pattern that we\u2019ve seen over the last several years. Scott Davis : Okay. Fair enough. Good luck guys. Thank you. Best of luck. Bob Livingston : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz : Bob, so during the quarter, actually you mentioned potential for $0.04 of hurricane impact. But it seems like your businesses were able to absorb the impacts pretty well. So could you see and did you end up seeing less impact than you thought and if there was any impact, what particular businesses absorbed the most impact? Bob Livingston : Well, we -- goodness, it sounds like a huge number, Andrew, but with respect to Harvey in Texas, our energy businesses that have operations there in the Houston area, we actually lost 4,000 work hours due to the storm and due to the factories being shut down for five or six workdays. And at the middle of September we were looking at a better bit of a challenge in closing the quarter to hit the topline plan and believe that we would incur some missed earnings that could amount to $0.03 to $0.04 for the quarter. The guy -- the teams there did an outstanding job in recovery activity in the second half of September. But I would still tell you that the cost for the incremental overtime and extra work that was done to take care of the customers. I think we incurred probably $0.01 to $0.02 of cost that was related to the storm, it\u2019s included in our EPS results for the third quarter and to a much lesser degree, much lesser degree, when the hurricane came up the East Coast, we had two, if not three of our larger operations on the East Coast that were shut down for one to three days, but the biggest impact was Harvey. Andrew Kaplowitz : Bob, do you see any positive impacts from the hurricane in terms of replacement in any of your businesses, any step up as you\u2019ve gone through October here? Bob Livingston : We\u2019re seeing a little bit of an increased activity in the Houston area with respect to glass doors to replace some of the damage doors. They are especially in the smaller footprint stores. And I think it\u2019s possible though we haven\u2019t booked a specific order yet. But it is possible that we see some order activity here in the fourth quarter as a result of storm. But if it happens it\u2019s not in our guide and we haven\u2019t seen the orders yet. Andrew Kaplowitz : And can you give us a little more color on your fueling and transfer market, you mentioned last quarter that it was actually a rail business that was a big lead on the business this year, was that still the case in Q3 and do you see any stabilization there and do you think a moderation in EMV-related activity that you expected this quarter? Brad Cerepak : Lot of questions. Bob Livingston : Okay. So that -- that\u2019s -- so let me be real specific here on transportation within our Fluids segment. That part of the business and Paul what is it, about $100 million in revenue. Brad Cerepak : Yeah. Bob Livingston : Roughly $100 million in revenue. Paul Goldberg : Yeah. Bob Livingston : I think it was down\u2026 Paul Goldberg : 18%. Bob Livingston : \u2026 almost 20% year-over-year in the third quarter. Our retail fueling business\u2026 Brad Cerepak : Stable at that level. But it\u2019s stable. Bob Livingston : Yeah. Okay. Within our retail fueling business the organic growth for retail fueling was 4%, 3% to 4% in the third quarter. Activity -- whether it would be dispensers, hanging hardware or underground components, activity in Europe and China continues to be quite strong and solid. With respect to the U.S. market, dispenser activity in the U.S. was down in the third quarter as we expected. The only other color note I would share with you is that in the last two weeks of September and it is continuing here so far in October, the order rates -- the incoming order rates for dispensers is actually picked up comfortably, I mean, it\u2019s a nice pickup. If that were -- if those order rates were to continue to hold or even expand as we go through the fourth quarter, I think this group has the opportunity to outperform on the revenue performance for the fourth quarter. EMV\u2026 Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks. I appreciate it. Bob Livingston : EMV, I\u2019ll give you comment on EMV. It was subdued in the third quarter again as we expected and spoke about in May and our June conference. We\u2019ve been -- we\u2019ve had engagement with three of our top brands, customer brands in this space in the -- just in the last few weeks with respect to discussions on their EMV rollout in 2018 and I think we will have a firming of opinion on what EMV activity will look like in 2018 in another two months to three months. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciated Bob. Bob Livingston : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hi. Good morning, Bob. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Andrew. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Andrew Obin : Good morning, guys. Just a question on Engineered Systems, so it does seem that margins have disappointed in the quarter, often when we have these situations it took several quarters for the ship sort of to right itself. How fast do you think Engineered Systems can get to sort of normalize operating leverage? Bob Livingston : I think you will see an improvement in their margins here over the next two quarters. Andrew Obin : Terrific. And is it more operational or is it more pricing? Bob Livingston : It\u2019s -- I would say, there would never be in an absence of operational opportunities. But I would tell you that the disappointment for the third quarter was around material inflation and pricing offsets. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a follow-up on free cash flow, your previous outlook was 140% conversion. You are now saying 130%, if we look at, sorry, cash flow statement. What\u2019s driving this? Is it working capital, but you also have sort of other items chewing out cash and there is a tax item that\u2019s chewing out cash. Can you give us more visibility as to why cash conversion is now little bit lower? Bob Livingston : Brad, can walk you through some specific details, but I would -- number one, I would tell you that, working capital in the third quarter was actually 100 bps better than it was year-over-year. But it was still less than we were looking for and expected. It\u2019s not inventory. We -- inventory came in as we expected, if not a tad better and it\u2019s not a payable issue. We did see, I think -- you have to help me here, I think, sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter, I think, we actually saw almost a full day increase in DSO. But part of this is the working cap -- the absolute dollar increase which comes back to cash, the absolute dollar increase in working capital just to support the strong organic growth that we\u2019ve had in the last two quarters. Brad Cerepak : Yes. So what, Bob, saying, is -- metrics are actually quite good in terms of working capital metrics. What we are seeing is the increase in accounts receivable specifically as we have the strong -- we\u2019ve had a strong revenue growth. So we are expecting strong collections in the fourth quarter to support a strong fourth quarter free cash flow and put us in that range of 10% to 11%. Andrew Obin : Terrific. Thanks a lot. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Brad Cerepak : Good morning, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey, can we just spend a moment talking about life after the wellsite separation? Bob Livingston : Life after the wellsite, yes. Deane Dray : Yes. Just how does your oil and gas exposure change and gets, I mean, most of its going to be in Fluid, bearings and compression likely into Engineered Solutions. But if you looked at it percent of revenues but also the upstream, midstream, downstream will change significantly like in more midstream, but can you take a pass at that, please? Bob Livingston : Well, we have looked at this, we have the date on this and it\u2019s been three weeks or four weeks since I look at it and I\u2019m struggling with recall to give you specific numbers. Obviously, it is down, our wellsite exposure is down. But I would first call out the comment that I made earlier on transportation. We would label this $100 million business in transportation to be energy-related. It may not be all upstream, some of it is midstream, but I would truly label it as energy-related. And bearings and compression, it\u2019s -- there is some upstream connection to bearings and compression. But it\u2019s not the correlation or the size that we have in the wellsite businesses. And the bulk of it other than bearings and compression is connected into the Fluids segment. Deane Dray : Got it. And then, as a follow-up on the material cost inflation in ES, just could you size that for us? And I\u2019m surprised, if you -- if I had to guess where you would have seen some pressure, it might have been in Refrigeration with copper being up as much, but maybe you just size the impact there? Bob Livingston : I will let Brad\u2026 Brad Cerepak : Yeah. Bob Livingston : \u2026give you some numbers on this. But let me comment on your Refrigeration note. We actually started to see material inflation raise its head in Refrigeration in the first quarter and the second quarter. I don\u2019t remember the numbers now. But I actually think our material inflation headwind in the first quarter just within Refrigeration, I think, it was $9 million. There were prices -- there were price increases put in as we exited the first quarter in Refrigeration. We didn\u2019t have -- we didn\u2019t cover it all in the second quarter, but the gap on material inflation significantly reduced in the second quarter. And I\u2019m not viewing that given our early position on raising prices in Refrigeration to cover the material, I\u2019m not looking at pricing -- price inflation to be a decremental for Refrigeration in the second half of the year. Deane Dray : Got it. And Brad was going to size the\u2026 Brad Cerepak : Yeah. Bob Livingston : You want to size. Brad, go ahead. Brad Cerepak : You want to size it. When you are coming out of the second quarter we said we would see about $34 million of net impact on materials for the year. That was our last guide. Now up to $38 million and I would say all of that for deltas in DES, because what Bob is referring to, fundamentally on DRFE we had a first half impact, as they were putting the prices in place and it neutralize itself for the back half. That\u2019s still true today for the most part, very minor change. Our DE business is seeing some steel increases. They\u2019ve also put in place some price increases here in October. So really is fundamentally move within DES and these guys -- our guys are working on this. They are working on price increases and more productivity. That is just going to take a period of time to offset. Deane Dray : Got it. And just lastly, and this is not a question, but a comment. Off-road jeep enthusiasts like me are sorry to see the Warn business leave the portfolio today. Let that be noted? Bob Livingston : Comment noted, Deane. Thank you. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Just a question firstly on the Warn business that you just touched on and I think when you bought that you paid about 2 times, 205 times sales, just wondered if you could give any color on the sale multiple and what kind of lost operating earnings we should dial-in for the next year? Bob Livingston : So earnings, earnings for the business that was sold for next year -- Brad, I am going to see $0.10 -- it might\u2026 Brad Cerepak : Well, that\u2019s the impact. Bob Livingston : That\u2019s the impact. Brad Cerepak : Lost earnings. Bob Livingston : Lost earnings $0.10. Look, please note that, I was very specific here in my scripted comments. We did not sell the entire Warn business. We sold the winch business, both the consumer and the smaller industrial winch business, that\u2019s part of -- that was part of Warn. What we kept was actually the OEM component business for the auto industry and the business activity that was sold from a revenue perspective, Brad, I think, was -- it would $130 million on that... Brad Cerepak : Yeah. That was. Bob Livingston : Yeah. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Roughly that number. Bob Livingston : Yes. Julian Mitchell : Very helpful. Thank you. And then my second question just, you saw obviously the big drop in organic bookings in Refrigeration & Food Equipment in Q3. Maybe give a bit more detail around the retail refrigeration softness and whether the cost cutting that you\u2019ve talked about the $40 million, is a lot of that waited into this segment, would you think that that retail softness or that broader booking softness in Refrigeration & Food will reverse soon? Bob Livingston : Okay. So let me deal with cost savings initiatives, first. As I said, it is rather broad-based, but I do exclude wellsite from that comment and would not -- I would not hang more than its fair share -- pro rata fair share of activity on Refrigeration. There has been activity in the second half of last year and through the first three quarters of this year with a focus on productivity and cost takeouts. There will be some more within that segment during the fourth quarter and going into 2018. But, Julian, this is, when I say broad-based, I mean, across the segments and across corporate and across the regions, it\u2019s going to be quite broad based. With respect to bookings, I\u2019d also put you back to my earlier comment about how strange or an odd of year it\u2019s been with respect to the, I call it the quarterly waterfall within this segment being quite different than what we have seen historically. That\u2019s part of what showing up in the softer bookings here in the third quarter. But it was not all within the Refrigeration business. We also saw soft year-over-year bookings within our can-shaping business following a very, very strong order pattern we had in the second quarter. And we\u2019ve got a fairly healthy, maybe even record revenue quarter scheduled for the can-shaping business and even some of the orders that have been booked in the last couple of quarters, we actually feel within the can-shaping business and that we\u2019re well-positioned now for 2018. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mircea Dobre of Baird. Mircea Dobre : Yes. Good morning. Bob Livingston : Good morning. Mircea Dobre : Just to follow-up on Julian\u2019s question on Refrigeration here, if we are looking at comps, they are getting significantly tougher as we go into 2018 for Refrigeration and if bookings, as you say, remain relatively soft here, I recognize that there is a seasonal issue. But I\u2019m wondering on tougher comps do you believe this business can actually grow next year and volumes aren\u2019t picking up, how should we think about margins? Bob Livingston : Number one, I would tell you that the segment leadership team, as well as the operating business leadership teams truly are convinced they can grow this business next year. If you look at it on a quarterly basis, again given the change in 2017 on how strong the first quarter was relative to historical comps as we move into 2018, it\u2019s going to be impossible for just the Refrigeration platform to have positive organic growth in the first quarter as you copied against the first quarter of \u201817. But I -- we are convinced that we will return to a more seasonal pattern in 2018 and I think you\u2019ll see the positive comps show up in the second half of the year. Mircea Dobre : Bob, do you have the sense that there are enough levers in this business where if your expectation for bookings growth doesn\u2019t materialized or things that you can do to address that from a margin standpoint? Bob Livingston : Yes. Mircea Dobre : Okay. And then my follow-up on P&I. So I know your comment is that there is quite good growth over there, but my sense again looking at comps here is that your business slowed even though your comp has gotten a lot easier organically sequentially. So I\u2019m sort of trying to understand the dynamics here, are we talking about different growth in textile versus your marking and coding, is there some lumpiness that I am not getting anything now. Bob Livingston : Yeah. Yeah. Well, there is a different growth profile between digital and marking and coding. I don\u2019t know what that difference was in the third quarter, but the growth in digital textile was pretty healthy in the third quarter. With respect to MI, I am -- I don\u2019t have that number in front of me, what 3% organic growth in the third quarter for marking and coding? Mircea Dobre : Okay. I will follow-up with Paul offline. Bob Livingston : Yeah. Mircea Dobre : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Nathan Jones : God morning, everyone. Bob Livingston : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Nathan Jones : I\u2019d like to talk a little bit about the pumps business in Fluids. You\u2019ve seen some pretty decent -- pretty good organic growth here in the last couple of quarters against what are fairly easy comps, the comps do get a bit more difficult here. Is the growth here just a result of the easy comps, have you seen that business fundamentally improve and what markets are driving it? Bob Livingston : Okay. So, yeah, I don\u2019t disagree with you. We look back on the comps. We -- the revenue for this business -- for the pumps group or platform in 2016 we were clearly still feeling the downdraft from the down cycle in the upstream oil and gas activity. We have seen with respect to upstream oil and gas, we have seen a nice recovery in those applications throughout the year. And by the time, I think, the fourth quarter, the comps probably aren\u2019t as easy as they were in the first quarter and second quarter this year, but we are also still showing fairly strong organic growth for the pumps business in the fourth quarter. But the other -- I call it two areas of pumps outside of our distribution activity is our hygienic and pharma business continues to perform very, very well and strong growth rates, and those comps are not easy, because they have strong growth rates last year as well and the -- our plastic and polymer business within pumps bit more of a project business, so you get some noise when you look at quarter versus quarter and on a year-over-year basis, but we will have strong growth in the plastics and polymer business for 2017 and we will have quite solid growth in that business in 2018. Nathan Jones : So it sounds like you -- you\u2019re thinking this is more of a fundamental recovery in the business than it is just a matter of comps in there\u2026 Bob Livingston : It did not\u2026 Nathan Jones : \u2026 would that also grow in \u201818? Bob Livingston : I am not denying that for the industrial applications related to oil and gas the comps are in our favor. But that\u2019s not what is driving all of the recovery and growth in our pumps business. Nathan Jones : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Scott Graham : Hi. Good morning. Bob Livingston : Good morning, Scott. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Scott Graham : Just looking at the four -- at the full year organic sales guidance and trying to triangulate toward a fourth quarter number. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong on the math, but it looks like you\u2019re essentially implying low to mid-single organic, and A, is that about, right, and B, is that wholly due to the Refridge down there? Bob Livingston : So organic for the fourth quarter, I\u2019m probably rounding to the nearest integer, but it 6%. Now the important question there, Scott, okay, is how much -- how much of the 6% is Dover remain co ex-wellsite. I don\u2019t have that data. But it is positive. For your comment about Refrigeration, even with the difference in the customer buying activity within the Refrigeration platform in 2017, organic growth in the fourth quarter for Refrigeration is at 1% or 1% and a fraction even with our lower expectations. Scott Graham : Okay. So that\u2019s better than I sort of was calculating. Great. Bob Livingston : Yeah. Scott Graham : The other thing is that... Brad Cerepak : Well, yeah, you should remember there\u2019s some disposition impact in there\u2026 Scott Graham : Yeah. Brad Cerepak : \u2026 that you take into account. Bob Livingston : Okay. Fine. Okay. Scott Graham : Yeah. No. Got it. Bob Livingston : Go ahead. Scott Graham : The other thing is that should we see and maybe the better question is on the ES margin, could you and I know there\u2019s a question around this earlier. Could you kind of give us sort of the buckets for you had an adjusted drop of 130 basis points. Could you kind of tell us, obviously materials is the biggest issue here, kind of give us the puts and takes, and maybe the sizings of kind of what happened there? Bob Livingston : Yeah. Well, Brad, can probably provide more specific numbers then I can. But I would say that better than a third may be approaching 40% of the drop had to do with material inflation, another... Brad Cerepak : Which we gave -- which we gave you the number. Bob Livingston : Yeah. And another third of it and again it may have been slightly more than that -- another third of it was the increased investment that I spoke about with respect to our digital print activity. And then a little bit of noise just around product mix. But that always happens, a little bit of noise around product mix. But that\u2019s -- I would say, 30% to 40% of material inflation, 30% solid on increased investment in digital print and the rest of it was product mix. Brad, do you want to clarify that? Brad Cerepak : No. I think that\u2019s it. Bob Livingston : Okay. Scott Graham : Yeah. And if I could sneak in another one in here, just very simply, you made a comment, Bob that you\u2019re confident that the refrigeration market will improve next year. Could you give us a little bit more behind that thinking? Bob Livingston : Well -- I will start first with a roll up with discussions with customers and we do expect our activity to be up next year. I don\u2019t have a final number. We are going through our planning process. We will actually kick that off in about 10 days to solidify our operating plans for 2018. But we know we have been awarded some business. We haven\u2019t received the orders yet. I don\u2019t know exactly what the order level will be in 2018, but it will be incremental. And on top of that even if the revenue line were to hold constant in \u201818 versus \u201817, we see a clear path and opportunity for improvement in margins. Scott Graham : Thanks a lot. Operator : Your final question comes from Charley Brady of SunTrust. Patrick Wu : Hi, guys. This is actually Patrick Wu standing in for Charley. Thanks for taking my questions. Bob Livingston : Okay. Hi, Patrick. Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Patrick Wu : Good morning. Good morning. Just -- it sounds like even though you guys are going to the up for your rationalization process, M&A is -- the pipeline is still pretty robust, you guys sound pretty optimistic about that. Can you talk a little bit more about which areas you are looking at and sort of how valuation are right now and are there any areas specifically where you guys would have a big appetite in terms of -- if the valuation is on the high side still? Bob Livingston : We still are interested in expanding in a general way across different verticals, our pumps play within Fluids and we\u2019re always looking for opportunities. We\u2019ve seen some to expand both in our marking and coding, as well as in our digital print area. But the act -- the areas we\u2019re looking at wouldn\u2019t be any different than we\u2019ve been focused -- than we\u2019ve been sharing even at the June Investor Conference, so there wouldn\u2019t be any difference there. Your question about valuation, it\u2019s interesting, because the -- we have walked away, well, we have been unsuccessful on a couple of recent opportunities to meet the sellers expectation on valuation and we just felt it was a little bit into the discomfort range for us and we just went pencils down and withdrew and we will wait for the next opportunities\u2026 Brad Cerepak : Bolt-on, add-on. Bob Livingston : Bolt-on, nothing large, nothing significant\u2026 Brad Cerepak : Nothing that we walked away from that was directly change\u2026 Bob Livingston : Yeah. Brad Cerepak : \u2026 think about the platforms. Patrick Wu : Okay. Got it. And then just one more on Refrigeration & Food Equipment, you guys answer the lot of quest -- lot of those questions already, but if we ex-out the sort of around $6 million in inefficiencies from Hillphoenix the last year, if you look at that number year-over-year is, I think, down by like around 50 bps or so. How much of the Hillphoenix -- how much of the drag is still -- Hillphoenix still inherent in that business, is that pretty much all gone now? And then also Wal-Mart has recently sort of talked about online grocery pickups and stuff like that, I think, they open to a tune of around 400 locations this year. Has that been any -- has that incrementally benefited you guys at all. Bob Livingston : So, let me deal with your Wal-Mart question or comment first. I would say that that activity on their pickup rollout has been minimal -- a minimal impact to our business. I\u2019m -- I know that we\u2019ve had an order here and order there, but it hasn\u2019t been notable with respect to creating any change. The -- within the Refrigeration segment, the opportunity -- the greatest opportunity for margin improvement for the segment resides in Hillphoenix and Anthony, primarily Hillphoenix. Patrick Wu : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Bob Livingston : Thanks, Pat. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : Thanks, Paula. This concludes our conference call. With that we thank you for your continued interest in Dover and we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s third quarter 2017 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Paul Goldberg : Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to Dover's fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are Bob Livingston and Brad Cerepak. Today's call will begin with some comments from Bob and Brad on Dover's fourth quarter operating and financial performance, and follow with a discussion of our 2018 guidance. We will then open up the call for questions. As a courtesy, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with a follow-up. Beginning with our 2018 guidance, Dover will provide adjusted EPS guidance and results, that will exclude after-tax acquisition related amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis better reflects our core operating results, offers more transparency and facilitates easy comparability with peer companies. A full reconciliation between forecasted GAAP and forecasted adjusted measures, reflecting adjustments for aforementioned acquisition related amortization, as well as carryover rightsizing costs, is included in our investor supplement.

Before we get started, I'd like to remind everyone that our comments today, which are intended to supplement your understanding of Dover, may contain certain forward-looking statements that are inherently subject to uncertainties. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any such forward-looking statement. Also, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. We would also direct your attention to our web site, where considerably more information can be found. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Livingston : Thanks Paul. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. I am pleased with our fourth quarter performance, which reflects strong global markets, resulting in broad based revenue growth and solid margin improvement at each segment. In particular, we had strong organic growth in Pumps, Waste Handling, Food Equipment and at our well site business. A number of other businesses also turned in solid performances, including marking and coding, vehicle service equipment and bearings and compression, resulting in organic growth of 8% in the quarter. Our organic growth in the quarter and for the full year, I believe, illustrates the strength of our portfolio. In all, our team's focus and execution resulted in a solid quarter, while also making significant progress on the Wellsite spin-off, right-sizing and several other commercial and investment initiatives. Our right-sizing initiatives in the quarter were important, to align Dover's cost structure with its size post spin. These right sizing actions are expected to deliver $55 million of benefits in 2018. I am also happy with the progress we have made towards transitioning to a more focused portfolio, with strong platforms and attractive markets. We are firmly on track to achieve our three year revenue and margin targets, which we outlined at our investor meeting last June. We delivered strong organic growth, and increased adjusted margin over 150 basis points in 2017, and are positioned to deliver further growth in margin expansion in 2018. In conjunction with our portfolio shaping activities, we have continued to build our platforms with two highly synergistic deals which were recently closed. These deals, while not large in scale, are margin accretive and enable us to expand the scope of our offerings and become a more important supplier to our customers. As we enter 2018, I am excited with our position. The global macro environment is expected to be constructive, leveraged by tailwinds from our productivity and cost initiatives and from U.S. tax reform. In 2018, we were expecting solid revenue growth, strong EPS growth, and another year of strong free cash flow. Our outlook is supported by continued commitment to our strategy, with a strong focus on margin expansion. I am very proud of the entire Dover team and want to thank them for their hard work and effort, as they continue to focus on serving our customers. Brad will now take you through the specifics of our fourth quarter performance and 2018 guidance, and I will come back at the end for some closing thoughts. Brad Cerepak : Thanks Bob. Good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned, we had a solid fourth quarter. We achieved organic growth in all segments and had bookings growth in three out of the four segments. Leverage on this organic growth, combined with benefits of our productivity and cost initiatives, led to strong year-over-year adjusted margin improvement. There were several highlights in the quarter; including broad based revenue and bookings growth in Engineered Systems, strong performance in Fluids, including broad based bookings growth; continued organic growth and significant year-over-year margin improvement, in refrigeration and Food Equipment, and lastly, strong revenue and bookings growth in Energy. Also from a geographic perspective, the U.S. and China markets had strong organic growth year-over-year. Let's start on slide 3 of the presentation deck; today, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $2 billion, an increase of 13%. Organic growth of 8% was complemented by acquisition growth of 6%. Partially offsetting these results, was a 3% impact from dispositions. FX provided a 2% benefit in the quarter. Adjusted EPS increased 49% to $1.13. This result [ph] exclusive costs associated with our previously announced right-sizing initiatives, as well as Wellsite separation related costs, which were both as expected. It also excludes net benefits from dispositions, benefits from the Tax Cuts Jobs act, and benefit from a reduction to a previously recorded product recall reserve. A full reconciliation of adjusted EPS can be found in our investor supplement. Adjusted segment margin was 14.4% in the quarter, a 210 basis point improvement over last year, primarily driven by incremental margin on increased volume. Bookings increased 13% to $2 billion. This increase is comprised of 8% organic growth and acquisition growth of 7%, partially offset by a 3% impact from dispositions and reflect strong growth in Engineered Systems, Fluids and Energy. Book-to-bill finished at 0.98. Overall, our backlog increased 15% to $1.2 billion. On an organic basis, backlog increased 10%. Adjusted free cash flow was strong, at $303 million in the quarter, up 26% over last year. For the full year, we generated $703 million of adjusted free cash flow, representing 9% of revenue. While our fourth quarter was strong, we fell short of our full year plan, primarily a result of robust December shipments, which increased receivables in the month. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made on working capital this year. Working capital as a percent of revenue was 16.4%, down 280 basis points from last year. Now turning to slide 4; organic growth was broad-based. Engineered Systems grew 8%, driven by solid activity across both platforms. Fluids Organic revenue increased 4%, principally driven by strong activity in our industrial Pumps and pharma and hygienic businesses. Refrigeration and Food Equipment increased 1% and Energy grew 23% organically. As seen on the chart, total acquisition growth was primarily driven by 20% growth in Fluids. Now on slide 5; Engineered Systems revenue of $667 million was up 8% organically, reflecting broad-based growth. Adjusted earnings increased 9% over the prior year and adjusted margin was 15.7%, representing a 20 basis point improvement. These results primarily reflect volume leverage, partially offset by some material cost inflation. Our Printing and Identification platform revenue increased 3% organically, driven by continued solid activity in our marking and coding business. In the Industrial platform, revenue increased 12% organically, reflecting strong shipments in Waste Handling and robust activity in our vehicle service equipment businesses. Bookings increased 6% overall, including organic bookings growth of 9%. Organic growth reflects solid activity across the segment. Book-to-bill was 1.04 for printing and identification, only 1.0 for industrials due to very strong shipments, and 1.02 overall. Now on slide 6; Fluids revenue increased 26% to $610 million, including acquisition growth of 20% and 4% organic growth. Organic growth was primarily driven by strong performances in our industrial pump and hygienic and pharma platforms. Adjusted earnings increased 61%, largely driven by volume growth, including acquisitions and productivity gains, especially at retail fueling. Volume leverage and ongoing retail fueling integration drove an adjusted margin improvement of 320 basis points, up to 15.2%. Of note, we have recently begun setting up pre-production runs in advance of consolidating retail fueling production facilities in Europe. This consolidation and others in retail fueling, will greatly improve margin of this business going forward. Bookings grew 34%, including 9% organic growth. Organic bookings growth was most prevalent in our Pumps and hygienic and pharma platforms. Book-to-bill was 1.01. Now let's turn to slide 7; Refrigeration and Food Equipment's revenue of $377 million included organic growth of 1%. The organic increase was largely driven by the expected strong activity in our can-shaping business within Food Equipment. Refrigeration results reflected the anticipated fourth quarter softness in our retail refrigeration markets, as well as some customer rationalization. Adjusted earnings increased 34% from the prior year and adjusted margin expanded 300 basis points. These results primarily reflect the favorable business mix and significant productivity improvements. Bookings decreased 3% organically, largely due to reflecting tough comps in our retail refrigeration business. Certain customers had ordered ahead of regulatory changes that went into effect in early 2017, which had the effect of softening back half in Q4 trends. Book-to-bill was 0.85. Now moving to slide 8; Energy revenue increased 24% to $364 million, reflecting growth in the U.S. rig count and increased well completion activity, include continued solid results in bearing and compression, which grew 3%. Adjusted earnings were $49 million and adjusted segment margin was 13.4%, both significantly improved over last year. These results were largely driven by strong volume growth. Bookings were up 18% year-over-year. Book-to-bill finished at 0.98. As Bob mentioned, our Wellsite businesses had a strong quarter, with 31% organic growth and grew 34% organically for the full year. Further, we had made significant progress on the spend and fully expect to complete the transaction in May. We expect our end markets to continue to improve, and are excited about our prospects as an independent company. Now going to the overview slide; number 9; our fourth quarter corporate expense included $16 million of right-sizing and other costs and $14 million of Wellsite related separation costs. Excluding these costs, corporate expense was $35 million, a little higher than expected. Interest expense was $35 million. Our fourth quarter tax rate, included a benefit of $51 million from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs act. The benefit was primarily derived from the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, offset in part, by a U.S. tax charge for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. Excluding the impact of the tax act and other discrete benefits of $10 million, our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 24.1%. This rate reflects a favorable mix of geographic earnings. For the full year, the effective tax rate was 27.1%. For the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million shares for $105 million, as part of our previously announced $1 billion repurchase plan. We expect to complete the plan later in 2018, utilizing the dividend received from Wellsite. Moving on to slide 10; please note our 2018 EPS guidance is presented on an adjusted basis. Starting this year, we will be adjusting for acquisition related amortization and right-sizing costs and Wellsite separation costs as incurred. Acquisition related amortization was $0.86 in 2017, and is expected to be $0.93 in 2018. The delta between the years is primarily driven by changes in the tax rate. Moving to the guide; we expect 2018 total revenue to increase 3% to 5%. Within this forecast, organic revenue growth is forecasted to be 5% to 7%. FX should add about 1%, and dispositions are expected to have a 3% impact. All segments are expected to have solid organic growth. The specific rates could be seen on the slide. Our forecast for corporate expense is $122 million and interest expense is expected to be about $130 million. The tax rate is forecasted to be 22% and 23%, four to five points lower than the normalized 2017 rate. This improvement is driven by the tax act. Our forecast for CapEx is 2.4% of revenue and full year free cash flow is expected to be between 10% and 11% of revenue. Further, we expect adjusted segment margin to improve about 110 basis points over 2017 to approximately 15.3%. In summary, we expect full year EPS to be $5.73 to $5.93. This represents an increase of 19% over 2017 on an adjusted basis at the midpoint. Our guidance does not include any 2018 costs related to the Wellsite separation. With that, I will turn the call back over to Bob, for some final comments. Bob Livingston : Thanks Brad. As expected, 2017 proved to be an exceptionally busy year for Dover. During that time, we have remained highly focused on the three year goals we shared at our Investor Day in June. For the period of 2017 through 2019, we communicated our targets to be 4% to 6% organic growth on an annual basis and cumulative adjusted margin expansion of 350 to 450 basis points. Although we know, there is still much to be done, I am pleased with the progress we made in 2017. On the revenue side, we performed very well against the three year plan, generating 8% organic growth. Every segment hit their organic revenue plan. I would also plan to like out, that the businesses that propelled our growth in 2017 remained strong in 2018. Namely, marking and coding, digital printing, and Waste Handling are all set up to have a strong year within Engineered Systems. In Fluids, we expect another year of strong growth in our Pumps and hygienic and pharma businesses. Refrigeration and Food Equipment should once again deliver steady growth, and our Energy businesses are well positioned for double digit growth. Looking forward, we expect E&P related activity to be slow in the first half with tough comps, driven by the compliance date delay we have previously discussed. We also expect retail refrigeration's first half to be impacted by tough comps related to last year's strong shipments in advance of regulatory changes. We are forecasting organic growth of 5% to 7% in 2018, a full point above the target in our three year plan, and we are confident we will deliver. In 2017, adjusted segment margin improved more than 150 basis points, and we are on pace towards our three year target range. With respect to margins; in Engineered Systems, we fell a little short of our 2017 target, primarily due to significant material cost inflation. We feel better about price costs as we enter 2018 and are also forecasting reduced investment as compared to a heavy investment year in 2017. In Fluids, commercial excellence programs, productivity, and our retail fueling integration have been and will remain the main drivers of margin enhancement. Refrigeration and Food Equipments margin grew nicely in 2017 on improved productivity, especially within retail refrigeration, and we expect further progress in 2018. And finally, Energy's strong margin growth is primarily as the result of volume leverage, which we expect to continue in 2018. In total, we expect more than 100 basis points of margin improvement in 2018, and our teams are aligned around achieving this goal. In closing, I feel that Dover is exceptionally well positioned in 2018. Our markets are healthy, and we have tailwinds from U.S. tax reforms and our right-sizing initiatives. We expect to deliver a very strong year in terms of EPS growth, and will remain disciplined with respect to capital allocation. We will return cash to shareholders by completing our $1 billion share repurchase, and by raising our dividend for the 62nd straight year. And we will continue to expand and enhance our platforms through margin accretive bolt-on acquisitions, and investing in organic growth. Now Paul, let's take some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks Bob. Before we take the first question, I'd just like to remind the listeners, if you can limit yourselves to one question with a follow-up, we have a lot of people in queue, and we will be able to hear more questions. So with that Crystal, if we could have the first question? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Good morning. Bob Livingston : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question; earlier in the year, you highlighted smaller acquisitions, something you haven't done before. Can you just comment why all of a sudden, you are putting out press releases on these smaller deals and brought on capital allocation going forward, given Wellsite, and now that we have visibility on taxes, how should we think about capital allocation going forward? Bob Livingston : So your first question about press releases, is that -- Andrew Obin : Yeah. You are highlighting smaller deals, which I don't think you have done in the past? Bob Livingston : We just thought they were important to announce Andrew. I mean, there is nothing magical about it. Andrew Obin : And how should we think about capital allocation going forward? Bob Livingston : Let's stay first with the share repurchase program that we announced in the fourth quarter, and I think we will have the bulk of that completed by the time we complete the spin in May of Wellsite. We sit here today. I do not have anything significant in our acquisition pipeline, that we would expect to close on, in the first five or six months of 2018. If 2018 does prove to be a light year with respect to M&A activity, I think it's very reasonable to expect the board and I to have further discussions around share repurchases for the second half. Andrew Obin : Terrific. And just a follow-up question on revenue outlook; lot of companies sort of don't seem to indicate impact of tax reform on demand in their revenue outlook? Where do you guys stand about potential upside to revenue from the tax reform? Bob Livingston : Yeah, it's not in our guide. I think I am probably giving a simpler response that you have heard or will hear during this earnings season from other capital good manufacturers. When you look around the Dover portfolio, about 30% of our revenue was recurring. The remaining 70% -- Andrew, I would tell you that about 80% of that remaining 70% is either capital goods or components we manufacture that go into capital goods. And a significant percentage of that 80% is U.S. based. In fact, I think our earnings split for 2017 was 60% domestic and 40% non-domestic, am I right on that number? Brad Cerepak : That's close. Right. Bob Livingston : And I think -- we will watch two or three areas for a pick-up in capital goods activity that could be a response to the tax act, and we will see it. And the industrial platform of Engineered Systems, I think we will see it in retail fueling, and perhaps as well in refrigeration, especially the Hillphoenix and Anthony business. Andrew Obin : Thanks a lot Bob. Bob Livingston : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker with UBS. Christopher Belfiore : Good morning. This is Chris on for Steve. Just wanted to kind of get a little bit more color on refrigeration. So could you provide some color on the split of the mix versus productivity in the 300 basis points of adjusted margin expansion? And with regard to that, how far along you think you are in adjusting the model? And the factory performance there, and then for the year kind of going into next year, where do you think margins in region like -- what's the optimal kind of organic growth rate, within that 3% to 4% side? Bob Livingston : So I don't have the detail on the margin improvement question you've asked. I would say, the lion's share of the margin improvement is productivity initiatives. But I can't give you specific numbers or specific percentage. But productivity has been a big part of it. But we have also been -- this business was probably earlier than some of our other businesses in 2017 to push some price increases through, as a result of the material inflation. I think that helped. But we have also done a fair amount, sort of around the edges. Nothing major, but fair amount of work around the edges to exit some product areas that I would just label it as underperforming historically and coming to a conclusion that we weren't able to improve the margins to where we want it to be. And I don't know what that number is, I don't remember that number. But could be as much as $40 million of revenue in 2017 that we exited. Brad Cerepak : And another $40 million to $50 million in 2018. Bob Livingston : In 2018 that we have exited, just because we didn't like the margin profile. Christopher Belfiore : Okay. And then, just quickly on just the EMV adoption within retail skewing. How much of that was full dispenser replacement versus just the payment? Bob Livingston : I don't have that data. In 2017, the bulk of our EMV activity as we have reported in the past, was in the first half of the year. We continue to see some activity in the second half, but nowhere near what we saw in the first half. We are taking a pretty cautious approach to the 2018 guide. I would say that, the 2018 guide has less EMV activity, pure EMV activity in the guide than we actually experienced in 2017, and I will repeat myself, I think that's cautious and conservative. We do believe that the EMV activity will begin to pick up in the second half, and we will provide further cover on that activity on the April and the July call, and my hope is, is that it gives us an opportunity to raise our guide as we move through the year. Christopher Belfiore : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good day everyone. Bob Livingston : Good day Jeff. Jeff Sprague : First question Bob, actually just it might be multi-part, but this goes on kind on some of the guidance dynamics here. First, you stated that the guidance excludes Wellsite one-off costs, but I am wondering does it kind of fully reflect the total cost of what we will have, when there is two companies? In other words, just the restructuring you are doing, getting at what we -- for a lack of a better term, maybe call it the stranded costs that would be graded when you expanded [ph] the new company? And then, just secondly on the guidance too, I was wondering that $0.28 to $0.26 for commercial and product investment, never really seen that called out before, I certainly don't recollect. That's a big number. What actually is that? Bob Livingston : Okay, well let me deal with the first question. The right-sizing activity in the fourth quarter -- let me give you a number there as well. I think our right-sizing in the fourth quarter Brad, were what, $45 million, $46 million, something like that, and there is some carryover that's in our guide for 2018, for right-sizing costs. I think the number is about $11 million Jeff, and the bulk of that -- I am not going to say 100% of it, but I think the bulk of that will occur in the first quarter. And then on top of that, we have another $12 million -- $10 million or $12 million of restructuring costs planned for 2018, that I would label is just normal on ordinary recurring type of activity that you have seen us tackle in the past few years. With respect to the final separation of Wellsite from Dover, there is going to be some stranded costs that we will have to deal with. We will deal with it at the time of the spin or slightly thereafter. But it is pretty modest, Jeff. Brad, is it $4 million, $3 million? Brad Cerepak : As reflective of the activities we have been taking, we have narrowed it down to about $3 million to $5 million. Still looking at more ways to reduce the stranded costs inside Dover. Jeff, keep in mind that, when Wellsite goes, the easiest way to think about this is, so does all the segment of DE Energy, the segment costs. Soma and his team and the costs they incur at the segment level, go with the spin. So that in essence is taken care of through the spin activity. They will have to add incremental costs above that number, as a new public company, we say 35. But in reality, it's a smaller piece, because the segment already is staffed up than 35. I hope that helps. Jeff Sprague : That does help. And then on that -- in the bridge item, that commercial and product investment buckets there? Bob Livingston : That may be a change with respect to our external communication. But Jeff, I wouldn't look at it as something new within Dover. There is a fair amount of investment we are looking at in 2018 for -- well I call it commercial facing activity -- Brad Cerepak : Including digital. Bob Livingston : Including our digital activity. And we do have a fair amount of projects around Dover in 2018 for productivity, which we have a tendency to support, not only with people assigned to productivity, but with capital. But I wouldn't look at it as a different activity, it is a slight change in how we present it. Jeff Sprague : Okay. And then just one other one, and I will move on. Just back to Energy; so it looks like we -- I am assuming this margin, which is nice year-over-year but down sequentially, reflects some moderation in actually drilling activity, and we are starting to get the ducks quacking, so to speak, confusion activities. Bob Livingston : I wish the duck for quacking more Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Yeah. Can you just kind of walk us through what's happening? Bob Livingston : I would tell you that, we probably saw two things in the fourth quarter within Energy, within Wellsite, that were a little bit different than we expected going into the quarter. Drilling activity was a bit reduced, especially in November and December, relative to our early in the quarter expectations. And I think the best market indicator there to sort of coalesce with is -- the rig count activity was, I would label it as a bit flattish in the fourth quarter, and we expected a little bit more growth. The second item is with respect to well completion activity. We did not see the pull-through in our rod lift business to the degree we thought we would. And on the flipside, we saw more ESP pull-through than we had planned, and there is a margin difference between those two technology offerings, Jeff. ESP operating margins are probably five to six points less than rod lift, and I would say, the overall cover with many of our customers -- we heard many comments that my CapEx budget is done for the year during November and the early part of December. To provide a little bit more cover on that, I would tell you that, activity here in January has been quite strong. Rig count activity has been up, and in fact the rig count increase -- I think it was last week, 15, 16, 17 unit increase last week, I believe was the largest weekly increase in rigs in this recent upturn. But the drilling activity is picking up, it's a little bit ahead of our plan for January, and our artificial lift business is on plan. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. Bob Livingston : Good morning Steve. Steve Tusa : Hey, what's the -- the tax rate on the amortization add-back looks a little bit higher than what you guys are kind of guiding to for the go forward, what's the difference there? Brad Cerepak : We are using a tax rate based on the jurisdiction of which the amortization -- the statutory rate in the jurisdiction of which that amortization is incurred. In other words, you think about it, we did acquisitions in different parts of the globe, and we are applying this statutory rate on a blended basis across each of those. Steve Tusa : Okay. So that's not going to change with tax reform? Brad Cerepak : No. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then, free cash flow, still pretty solid, but a little bit light of what we were expecting. It looks like there was, we don't have the details yet, but perhaps some working capital. Can you just talk about what your assumptions are there going forward? Is this just a little bit of a working capital build on the back of better volumes? I think you guided to 11 or 13 or something like that, so just curious on the free cash flow front? Brad Cerepak : No, no, no. Don't take the 13%. We got into 10% to 11%. Steve Tusa : No you had -- I think you had -- we were expecting something a little bit higher this year, specifically? Bob Livingston : Actually, I was a little disappointed with the outcome for the year on our cash flow. It was a bit disappointing to not hit the 10% number Steve. But two things, you sort of tried give me an answer that working capital maybe was going up. Actually, let me tell you, working capital for Dover in 2017, we lowered it a 140 basis points year-over-year. What we did see in the fourth quarter was December revenue was much stronger than we would normally anticipate when you look at past years. And we typically get a little bit, I would call it receivable liquidation during December, and with the strong revenue in December, that did not happen. I think for the most part, I would tell you that cash collections were not really the problem, even though we didn't liquidate draw-down receivables in December. But I think we had a little bit more of an outflow in a couple of areas than we had expected. CapEx spending was a little bit higher in the fourth quarter than we had planned, and I think we would tell you now, that maybe our -- not maybe, our outflow on tax payments could have been lower than the payment we make. And I think even making those adjustments would get us really close to 10% but not over. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then lastly, any price costs, headwinds in your guidance for 2018, steel and like that? Bob Livingston : That's a good question. Steve Tusa : Thanks for that. Bob Livingston : Our material cost dynamic versus price in 2017, we actually had a negative headwind of almost $15 million in 2017. The bulk of that was -- I think all of it was in the first three quarters of last year. As we look at 2018, given the current material costs and the pricing actions we took in the second half of 2017, we see that flipping. We see a $13 million to $15 million tailwind in our guide on material versus price. Brad Cerepak : That's all-in bulk price. Bob Livingston : Yeah, that's all in. Steve Tusa : Great. Okay. Thanks guys. Bob Livingston : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Bob Livingston : Good morning Deane. Deane Dray : Hey Bob, [indiscernible] expand on the comment in refrigeration when you said you saw and had some customer rationalization. Just kind of expand what was going on there and maybe size the impact if you could? Bob Livingston : Okay. So it was actually happening throughout the year. This wasn't just a fourth quarter activity. I think in the first quarter of last year, we said no to about $20 million worth of business within retail refrigeration that we just weren't happy with the margins on. And getting the feel like we could improve them to the point where it would be constructive to our margin targets for this segment. In the fourth quarter we actually divested, was it in -- yeah, it was in the fourth quarter we divested a small business, glassdoor business in China that we have been working very diligently to improve the margins and grow it and just have not been successful. So we divested it in the end of fourth quarter. And I also believe in the fourth quarter, we shut down our aftermarket service business in Canada, that I don't remember the revenue number there Brad, but it was about $10 million. And I believe, the glassdoor business in China, Deane, was also about $10 million. A little bit here to a little bit there, but they were the three major items. But all in total, it was about $40 million. Deane Dray : And is that -- do you have more in store for the first quarter? Or has that run its course? Bob Livingston : I would say that it has run its course. Deane Dray : Okay. And then on the Energy side, just last question for me, can you clarify whether some of the uptick in the Energy was the recovery from the hurricane dislocations that you saw in the third quarter, it was -- I think you had sized it like $0.04 in the third quarter, did that all get recouped here in the fourth quarter? Bob Livingston : Okay. So the $0.04, in my recalling, the $0.04 was a preliminary number that I provided, I think in mid-September. That was sort of the risk we were seeing at the time. I think when we actually closed the third quarter, the guys, the business teams had done a tremendous job in closing the gap, and I believe we felt -- at the end of the quarter, we were only a penny off, because of the hurricane. So I wouldn't label much activity in the fourth quarter as being a carryover from the storm interruption in the third quarter. Deane Dray : Got it. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning guys. Bob Livingston : Good morning Scott. Scott Davis : Can we just refresh our memories a little bit or refresh my memory I should say, on Pumps. How much of that business goes for distribution versus direct? And I guess part of the question I am getting at is that, the growth you saw, is there some restocking going on that, folks want to make sure they are geared up for higher operating rates? Bob Livingston : No. So within Pumps, and I am including our PSG business our [indiscernible] business and our hygienic and pharma. Maybe 60% of it is through distribution, the balance of it being direct to the end user or an integrator. No, your question about restocking, I actually believe that the bulk of that restocking activity, we saw in the second and third quarter. I think what we saw in the fourth quarter and what we expect here in 2018 is true end market pull. Scott Davis : Right. Okay, that's helpful. And then I don't think you said this, and if you did, excuse me. But can you just give us a bit of a walk around in the world, I mean, where you saw strengths and weaknesses globally versus your model? Bob Livingston : For the fourth quarter? Scott Davis : Yeah. For the fourth quarter. Bob Livingston : I would say that China and the U.S. market activity was a bit stronger than we anticipated. In fact Scott, it was interesting, organic growth in the U.S. in the fourth quarter was a little better than 10%. We saw good organic growth, double digit in China, and in Europe, we saw flat. It was relatively flat versus the fourth quarter of 2016. But I would give our business teams a little color on that, by pointing out that the fourth quarter of 2016, we had some pretty healthy, I call them project shipments in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2016. But almost 11% of the U.S. was a little bit stronger than we anticipated. Scott Davis : Interesting. Okay. Very good. Thank you. I will pass it on. Bob Livingston : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. John Inch : Hi everyone. Bob Livingston : Good morning John. John Inch : Hi Bob, and Brad and Paul. I am coming up to about $4 on Dover Remainco under the old accounting. So excluding -- or including the amortization, excluding Wellsite. Is that -- Brad, is that about the number? And if so, in terms of your guidance for 2018, what kind of a growth rate would that represent Trying to understand sort of how you are guiding your EPS or your thought process around EPS kind of on the apples-to-apples basis, ex-Wellsite? Brad Cerepak : Yeah. Well I guess I would start by saying, you can anticipate that we will provide clarity on that in the April call, as we get closer to the spin date in May. I would say though, keep in mind, that as Wellsite comes out, the two things I would point out, that the model you would expect when we get to April. One is, is that our forecast or our guidance for 2018, does not include the current thinking around the buyback that we will do, once we receive the cash -- Bob Livingston : The dividend. Brad Cerepak : The dividend. So the stock will be bought back in that May timeframe, once we receive the dividend. And then secondly, just to give you a little bit of a sense of what direction it goes in. Wellsite is mostly a U.S.-based earner and so the tax rate for us will probably move closer to the low end of the range and they will be slightly above the range we gave. And so that will have implications to your modeling as well. That's probably about all I would comment on at this point, put aside, waiting for April. John Inch : All right. So Wellsite, just to recap, when you said Wellsite, it's going to have a higher tax rate, and the Remainco businesses are going to have a lower tax rate, I am sorry, is that what you said? Brad Cerepak : That's what I said. John Inch : In the range? Okay. Brad Cerepak : I'd say on the amortization line, because we now start to report that way. If you think about the amortization, we said $0.93 -- amortization related to Wellsite within that $0.93 is roughly $0.23, $0.24. John Inch : Okay. Good, that's helpful. In the quarter, just a good look at the quarter for a second, I think your restructuring that you actually include, so not the exclusionary stuff was about $2 million. How did that compare with your plan and what is the plan for 2018? I think you maybe -- said it Bob, but I still can't quite understand what's kind of included and excluded? And didn't you say that there was, we are going to do $18 million to $20 million of restructuring in 2017? Brad Cerepak : Yeah, we had said that around $18 million to $20 million, that's kind of normal for a given year. I think the fourth quarter was a little lighter, to your point. Your number is not that far off for the quarter and for the year, we did about $13 million or $14 million, so lighter compared to the original forecast that we gave. In 2018, we have $11 million of right-sizing carryover, so again $45 million, $46 million in the fourth quarter, $11 million in the first quarter, maybe just a little bit falls into the second quarter, but most of that in the first quarter. And then we had built in to our guidance, what I'd call normal restructuring, things that we do every year, we have been doing for five years, of around $10 million. John Inch : Okay. So and -- Brad Cerepak : Figure all in, right-sizing and restructuring in 2018 of $21 million. John Inch : Of which we are excluding the $11 million, is that right? Brad Cerepak : Yeah. John Inch : And you are keeping the $10 million? The reason that's $10 million versus $18 million to $20 million, is because Wellsites is not there, is that the biggest chunk of it? Brad Cerepak : Well, I would say, look the right-sizing has captured a lot of things, but as I -- I think we mentioned earlier. I don't think we are done sitting here today. I mean, Bob can comment on this. I mean, I am not for a moment thinking that, we will come in at $21 million. I think that there is likelihood you could see that number come up -- Bob Livingston : Should be higher. Brad Cerepak : Incremental, not dramatically different, but incrementally higher, as we continue to work through and get closer to the spin-off date. Do you want to add anything on that Bob? Bob Livingston : No. And the $12 million, would I label as normal and ordinary type of restructuring? John, you have to appreciate, that we know what those projects are. As we roll through the first and second quarter, I fully expect the business team leaders to identify other opportunities, and if it makes sense, we will do it. John Inch : And then just lastly Bob, refrigeration, when you were transitioning your ops to smaller lot sizes and bulking the sort of more flexible production systems if you will, did that completely through [ph] so that refrigeration margins today are going to be a function of volume and obviously associated pricing mix or is there still work to do around that front? Bob Livingston : No. I think most of that work around -- that we tackled around the reduction of lot sizes is complete. Now, don't take that statement as meaning that there aren't additional productivity projects that we can tackle this year and next year, because there are. And the fourth quarter, we actually -- in our case business, we actually shut down one of the case factories and have consolidated all of case manufacturing into one factory, which is a byproduct, and the end result of many of the productivity initiatives we have been working on over the last two years, just to -- I'd tell it, react to the difference in the lot sizes and some of the improvements we have made in process a little. But it's a -- the team there did a great job in 2017, and I know that you are very-very [indiscernible] excited about expanding that great job again in 2018. John Inch : And lastly, sorry, core variable margin contribution, 19, based on your guide, ex-Wellsite, what do you think that is, Brad? Brad Cerepak : I don't have that number. John Inch : No, but it has been in the -- you historically had this 30%-35% number? Brad Cerepak : You know, I'd say it's a little bit higher than that. I think that with all the productivity -- and again, I am doing this on an adjusted basis, adjusted to adjusted year-over-year. John Inch : Yeah. That's why I am asking. Brad Cerepak : It's a little bit higher than that. I'd say, it's closer to 38%, 39%. John Inch : Okay, awesome. Thank you very much. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Bob Livingston : Thanks Jeff. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey guys. Bob Livingston : Good morning Andrew. Andrew Kaplowitz : Bob, I just want to go back to refrigeration for a second. Maybe just talk about your confidence level in growing that business 3% to 4% in 2018. Obviously, we have seen the book-to-bill relatively weak a little, last two quarters. But do you have the visibility towards bookings growth in the first half of the year, and should we thinking that 2018 is basically back half loaded a bit on the easier comparisons in the second half of the year? Bob Livingston : Okay. Well on comps, it may appear to be back-end loaded. I would say -- our expectation for 2018 for the food retail business, this is Hillphoenix and Anthony, I think it's going to return to the more traditional seasonal pattern that we have seen over the last seven, eight or 10 years, and that would be that the second quarter and the third quarter are the ramp and the heavy build seasons, with the first quarter and the fourth quarter being, I'd call it, the shoulder seasons. And that's quite different than what we experienced in 2017. The order rates that we are expecting in the first quarter to support our plan for the first quarter and our ramp for the second quarter, I can tell you that here in January, our order rates are on plan. So we actually feel rather confident with our target and our guide on refrigeration. Paul Goldberg : You still available Andy? I guess Andy is gone. Crystal, you're still there. Is anybody there? Operator : Yes I am here. Paul Goldberg : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing or additional remarks. Paul Goldberg : Thanks Chris. So yeah, this concludes our conference call. As always, we thank you for your continued interest in Dover, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a good day. Bye. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's fourth quarter 2017 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Speaking today are Bob Livingston, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Paul Goldberg, Vice President of Investor Relations. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg, you may go ahead. Paul Goldberg : Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning and welcome to Dover's first quarter earnings call. Today's call will begin with comments from Bob and Brad on Dover's first quarter operating and financial performance, and follow with our 2018 guidance. We will then open the call up for questions. As a courtesy, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with a follow-up. Dover's providing adjusted EPS results and pro forma EPS guidance that exclude after-tax acquisition related amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis better reflects our core operating results offers more transparency and facilitates easy comparability with peer companies. A full reconciliation between forecasted GAAP and adjusted measures, reflecting adjustments for aforementioned acquisition related amortization, as well as separation cost and the rightsizing costs, is included in our investor supplement. Please note that our current earnings release, investor supplement and associated presentation can be found on our website dovercorporation.com.

We would also direct your attention to our website, where considerably more information can be found. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob Livingston : Thanks Paul. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for this morning's conference call. Our first quarter performance reflects continued broad based strength in our industrial markets. We generated 4% organic growth and delivered margin improvement in three of our four segments. In particular, we had strong organic growth in environmental solutions, printing and identification, heat exchangers and our upstream energy businesses. A number of other businesses also turned into solid performances including Pumps, vehicle service equipment and industrial ventures. Retail fueling revenue was in line with their expectations whereas retail refrigeration was lower than expected reflecting tough comp in south market conditions. With regard to margin, we delivered 70 basis points of improvement year-over-year and expect further increases in coming quarters especially in fluids and refrigeration equipment. We performed well in engineer systems in energy. Refrigeration and Food equipment was below expectations on lower volume. Fluids margin were slightly off reflecting some temporary inefficiencies regarding our factory consolidation in Europe and all our teams have done a nice job this quarter, a pushing pricing through to offset material cost inflation especially for steel. We also had strong organic bookings in Engineer Systems and Fluids positioning these segments well as we move through the second quarter. The team made great progress on the spin off during the quarter and on May 9th Apergy will become a fully independent company. During the quarter, we also announced a management transition. Rich Tobin will begin his President and CEO on May 1st, I'm very pleased Rich has joined us and I'm excited to see him put his stamp on the company. Let me take a moment to cover several other things happening across the company. We have continued to make progress on our digital efforts, our remote monitoring and IOT solutions and retail fueling and environmental solutions have enabled us to win significant new business. We're actively developing several focused offerings to help our customers, manage cost and improved productivity. Our pipeline is developing nicely. We have bolt-on target companies in multiple areas that add either technology or in market presence which is complementary to our existing business. And lastly, we are well positioned to take advantage of the constructive global macro environment as most of our businesses are booking well and are poised to deliver solid organic growth this year. We had provided pro forma 2018 guidance, which excludes our upstream energy business. We expect solid revenue growth and strong EPS growth. Brad will now take you through the specifics of our first quarter performance and our guidance, and then I will come back for some closing comments. Brad Cerepak : Thanks Bob. Good morning, everyone. As I take you through the next few slides, please note there being presented inclusive of our upstream energy businesses. As Bob mentioned, our results reflect organic revenue and bookings growth in three out of the four segments. Leverage on this organic growth, combined with benefits of our productivity and cost initiatives, led to solid year-over-year improvement and adjusted margin. There are several highlights in the quarter; including broad based revenue and bookings growth in Engineered Systems, within Fluids, we had strong performance in our industrial pumps, pharma, and international retail fueling business, as well broad based bookings growth across the segment. And within Refrigeration and Food Equipment, we had strong growth in our heat exchanger and can-shaping business. In the quarter, we also experienced temporary operating efficiencies including parts availability issues in retail fueling and weaker than expected market conditions in retail refrigeration. From a geographic perspective, the U.S, Europe and China markets all grew year-over-year. Let's go through the details starting on Slide 3 of the presentation deck. Today, we reported first quarter revenue growth of 6%, which includes organic growth of 4% and 1% from acquisitions. Partially offsetting these results was a 3% impact from dispositions. FX provided a 4% benefit. Adjusted EPS increased 26% to $1.16. This result excludes acquisition related amortization cost, as well as costs associated with our previously announced right-sizing initiatives, and separation related costs. A reconciliation of adjusted EPS can be found in our investor supplement. Adjusted segment margin was 12.5%, a 70 basis point improvement over last year, primarily driven by incremental margin on increased organic growth. Bookings increased 4% overall. This includes 4% organic growth, which reflect strong results in Engineered Systems and Fluids of no excluding Apergy, organic bookings also increased 4%. Book-to-bill finished at 1.10 excluding Apergy, book-to-bill was 1.12. Our first quarter adjusted free cash flow was as expected, reflecting a slight increase in working capital and higher compensation payments. Overall, we are pleased with our continued progress on working capital. Specifically working capital as a percent of trailing 12 month in revenue was 17.5%, down 200 basis points from last year. Now let's turn to Slide 4. As previously mentioned 4% organic growth was driven by broad-based growth in both Engineered Systems and Energy. Fluids Organic revenue was essentially flat were industrial Pumps and international retail fueling was largely offset by U.S. E&P activity which came in soft as expected. Refrigeration and Food Equipment decrease 7% primarily on the combination of tough comps and lower capital spending in retail refrigeration markets. As seen on the chart, foreign exchange was a 4% benefit while dispositions impacted revenue 3%. Now, turning to Slide 5. Engineered Systems revenue was up 8% organically, reflecting broad-based growth. Adjusted earnings increased 15% over the prior year and adjusted margin was 15.3%, representing a 110 basis point improvement. These results reflect solid conversion on volume and the ability to mitigate increasing material cost through pricing. Our Printing and Identification platform revenue increased 4% organically, driven by continued solid activity in both marking and coding and digital print businesses. In the Industrial platform, revenue increased 10% organically, reflecting strong - very strong shipments in Waste Handling and broad based growth across other businesses. Bookings increased 6% overall, including organic bookings growth of 8%. Organic growth reflects continued solid activity across the segment. Book-to-bill was 1.01 for printing and identification, and a very strong 1.19 for industrials, and 1.11 overall. Now on Slide number 6. Fluids revenue increased 5%, including acquisition growth of 1% and 4% from FX. Organic revenue was flat, principally reflecting solid pump international retail fueling and pharma market offset by U.S. E&P activity. Adjusted earnings increased 7%, largely driven by volume growth. Adjusted margin increased 20 basis points to 10.2%. This performance reflects earnings on volume largely offset by temporary inefficiencies including supply chain shortages of components used in retail fueling. Of no, productivity will improve as a retail fueling factory consolidation is completed in the second quarter resulting in substantially improve margin on a sequential basis. Bookings activity was strong and grew 11% overall, including 6% organic growth. Organic bookings growth was broad based. Book-to-bill was a strong 1.13. Now let us turn to Slide 7, refrigeration of food equipment revenue organically declined 7%. The decline is largely driven by tough comps and weaker than expected capital spending in retail refrigeration. Last year we saw seasonally strong first quarter activity in front of the new DOV energy efficiency regulations. We knew that this volume wouldn't repeat in 2018, whereas our can-shaping and heat exchanger businesses performed very well in the quarter. Earnings decreased 13% from the prior year and large contracted 80 basis points reflected the impact of lower volume. Bookings decreased 14% organically largely reflecting softness in retail refrigeration market in order timing in can-shaping equipment. Book to bill was 1.01. Now on Slide 8, energies organic revenue increased 17% reflecting growth in U.S rig count and increased well completion activity and it includes continued solid results in our industrial winch business. Earnings and segment margin both significantly improved over last year. Bookings were up to 14% year-over-year. Book to bill finished at 1.03. As Bob mentioned, our Apergy business had a strong quarter with 22% organic growth. Going to the overview on Slide 9, our first quarter corporate expense included $12 million of separation cost and $1 million right sizing cost, excluding these cost corporate expenses was $29 million. Interest expense was $34 million. Our first quarter tax rate was 22.6% in line with expectations when excluding discrete benefits. In the first quarter, we completed $45 million of share repurchases as part of our previously announced $1 billion repurchase plan. Now moving on to Slide 10, which shows our updated 2018 guidance? Our updated guidance is presented on a pro forma adjusted basis, as discussed last quarter, we're adjusting for acquisition related amortization and right sizing cost and separation cost as incurred. Further updated guidance now excludes Apergy for the full year. Lastly, within our updated guidance bearing and compression which was part of our energy segment will be reported within fluids. And Tulsa Winch which was also part of the energy will be reported in Engineered Systems. Moving to the guide, we expect 2018 total revenue to increase 45%. Within this forecast organic revenue growth is expected to be 3% to 4%. Acquisition will add 1% and FX should add about 3%. Dispositions are expected to have a 3% impact. All segments are expected to grow organically. Further, we expected adjusted segment to improve about 50 basis points over 2017 to approximately 15.1% at the midpoint. In summary, we expect full year adjusted EPS of $4.70 to $4.85. Our guidance exclude second quarter costs related to the Apergy separation. Further this guidance represents an increase of approximately 15% over 2017 at the midpoint. With that, I will turn the call back over to Bob, for some final comments. Bob Livingston : Thanks Brad. Going forward the strong bookings in Engineered Systems and Fluids and are strong book to bill supports our organic revenue forecast. Additionally, we expect marking and coding, digital printing and waste handling to continue to perform very well. In Fluids, we expected another year of strong growth in our pumps and pharma businesses. We also expect bearings and compression to be solid and retail fueling to sequentially improve. In Refrigeration and Food Equipment, we expect continued and strong performance in heat exchangers and can-shaping equipment, while retail refrigeration will improve in the back half of the year as several customers step up the remodel activity. With regard to the second quarter, we expect both Engineered Systems and Fluids to deliver solid organic growth as they ship under strong order books. Retail refrigeration in second quarter will continue to be impacted by tough comps related to last year strong shipments and softer overall markets. We also expect to see improved margin on a sequential basis that all three segments especially at our fluids and refrigeration and food equipment segments. I believe that Dover is well positioned in 2018. In closing, I just want to say that it has been a great honor and pleasure to serve as Dover's CEO these past nine years and I would like to personally thank every Dover employee for contributing to our success. I wish you all well and I am sure you'll have continued success in the future. Now Paul let's do some questions. Paul Goldberg : Thanks Bob, before we take questions I just want to remind everybody that if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow up, we'll be better able to handle the 18 analysts that are in queue right now. So with that Jennifer let's take the first question. Operator : Your first question will come from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you, good morning everyone. Bob congrats on a good run; enjoy your retirement thanks for all your help over the years much appreciate it. Hey, I know you don't want to speak for Rich and you made the comment about him putting his stamp on things, but is it safe to assume that given that he's on the Board that this guy that we're getting today and the outlook we're getting today kind of conforms at his views of the world also? Bob Livingston : He is not inherent of the guide providing today I can guarantee you that, Jeff. I think the forecast and the guide we have shared with you today with respect to I would say with respect to engineered systems reflects the very strong visibility we have for them in the second quarter. And I would also say the third quarter. With the fourth quarter, I think we are being a bit conservative with our outlook in engineered systems. And on fluids I will tell you, we didn't shared this in the comments, in the prepared comments here but we were very-very pleased with the order activity in retail fueling in the first quarter, especially as it build through the quarter, and have pretty strong confidence that we are going to see sequential both revenue and margin improvements in this platform and in this segment as we move through the year. It would be --I think the last thing I would want to do is Jeff as Rich is coming on board would be to raise guidance because I don't think it's necessary today. I think if there's going to be any change in guidance with respect to our strong activity I'm going to leave that for Brad and Rich to speak to you about on the July and the October call. Jeff Sprague : Great, understood and then I just wonder if we could drill a little bit more in the refrigeration for a moment then obviously there's a lot of uncertainty among grocers in particular on CapEx they want to spend and what they want to spend on and that sort of thing. Can you just provide a little bit more detail what you're hearing from the channel? Do you see capital spend perhaps freeing up later in the year and is there any particular price cost dynamics that influenced the margins in refrigeration in the quarter? Bob Livingston : So let me deal with the first one. I think there is a growing confidence that we have as a result of input and conversations we're having with customers that we will see increased spending capital spending in the second half of the year. But Jeff I will tell you it is going to be very-very much driven by remodel activity not new store construction. And without sharing the name of the customers, we have a couple of new customers that enter the order books in the second half of the year as well. So I feel pretty good with the outlook right now for refrigeration. Material and cost are pricing, I'll give you a response on refrigeration but I think it's just as important I give it for all of Dover. We entered the year with about $14 million of what we labeled as tailwind for 2018 what we thought we pricing - the tailwind we thought we have pricing above material and cost inflation, some of that has evaporated, Jeff. I think I'd get throughout the number $14 million on the January call and I would say our forecast right now and our guide assumes that $10 million of that $14 million has dissipated. But we have been much quicker this year than we were last year in pushing pricing through and many of our companies especially the larger users of steel have implemented price increases during the first quarter, we are taking orders now that have the new prices increases in them. And feel like we have got a much better start on covering the material cost inflation with our price increases this year than we did last year, across the border yes. Operator : Your next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And I would like just congratulations Bob and wish you all the best. On the just looking at that slide in the appendix, you talk about the $0.05 of the EPS this year, coming from incremental share repurchase just wondered what sort of dollar number of buyback spending that tally too, and if there had been any change in the aspiration to spend the spin dividend all on buybacks this year? Bob Livingston : Well, I'll give you a headline comment or response on that, and Brad can provide a bit more detail. So the nickel change in our guide with respect to share repurchases does assume that the dividend we received from Apergy spin will be fully allocated, 100% allocated to share repurchases in 2018. That said Julian, I will tell you the nickel increase on the guide is as conservative as we can make it with respect to the share repurchase activity. It does not assume an early ASR with respect to share repurchases; it is sort of feathered in our guide to occur during the balance of the year following the spin of Apergy. I will leave to Rich and to Brad and to the Board to make their final decision on how those shares repurchase activity actually occurs. But I'll repeat myself. The nickel could not be any more conservative on our share repurchase activity. Brad Cerepak : So, let me just add I mean a couple of facts there, I guess our forecast is assuming about 140, 154.6 or so shares weighted average for the year. Remember the timing of the nickel is it could be done lots of different ways to Bob's point. But the power actually comes forward into - goes forward into 2019, where we see those shares, opening up 2019 in that 140, 145 million to 146 million type of share range on spending of that $700 million. So you have this carryover benefit going into 2019. Julian Mitchell : Very helpful, thank you. And then my follow up would just be around the corporate cost, the guidance has gone up about $7 million I guess that's mostly costs that were in Apergy that are sort of stranded at the remainco for now. But I guess when you think about what that number should be feel revenue based excluding Apergy how much lower do you think that run rate should be than the $129 million? I guess the stranded costs would go away and then some of that base corporate cost also should be coming down because of the smaller revenue base? Bob Livingston : Well, one of the right sizings we did last year, as you know and that's why we call it rightsizing, getting ready for the Apergy spin. You're correct that our previous guide I believe was one $122 million now $129 million. Little, almost $5 million of that I would say is this Apergy stranded cost that we've shown here in corporate. Of that $5 million we got to work through the details of that we have been working through the details some of it will go away a lot of it will go away into 2019 but some of it fixed infrastructure of a building for instance doesn't go away. But we're active on it. We're on top of it. We expect to continue to work it down and I would expect the corporate cost number to continue to come down a bit into 2019. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. And Bob congratulations on your retirement and thanks for the hard work over the years. Just one question given all the macro concerns just wanted to drill into one of the businesses, drill down to one of the businesses, specifically on printing and IT. Could you provide more detail by geography and end-markets both on sales and what are you seeing on orders if you seeing signs of a slowdown in any specific market or any specific geography? Bob Livingston : Okay. I don't have the detail with me, the geographic detail for printing and IT though I do know in the first quarter I know that order rates were extremely balanced around the globe. There was nothing unusual in growth rates on order activity in the first quarter that would raise any concerns, but I don't have the specific numbers. And order activity the answer is no. We have seen no sign; no evidence in our order book would actually speak just the opposite of your question that the order activity did build through the quarter. And we are booking at a fairly solid 2018 at Markem-Imaje and another double-digit growth rate in our digital print business. Andrew Obin : And just a follow up on refrigeration and food equipment question, given sort of the weakness of organic orders in the first quarter you are saying that you are seeing pickup in orders, but basically the pickup on orders has to be a fairly substantial to get you to flat revenues for the segment for the year. How much uncertainty is there about the order pickup? Or do you actually have enough visibility at this point to feel comfortable with this forecast? Bob Livingston : Well number one this business, let's speak to our retail refrigeration, Hill PHOENIX and Anthony. I would tell you that and our customers recognize this is that our lead times over the last I would say six months maybe nine months are significantly shorter than what we were dealing within I think it was in, help me here guys in 2016 and in the first half of 2017 as we were making so many changes there in the factories. So it's the short cycle nature of this business is very well recognized by our customers today. We have very strong input from customers with respect to anticipated spending in the second half and the new awards that I referenced or hinted to earlier those are not yet, I mean we're not waiting for those to be signed they have been awarded. Andrew Obin : Fantastic thank you very much Bob and enjoy your retirement well deserved. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys, good morning, congrats as well. Congratulations to Mr. Livingston. So just on refrigeration the book-to-bill was good but not perhaps as strong as it's been historically in the first quarter because obviously this is a very seasonal business with 2Q and 3Q stronger than 1Q and 4Q. Should we expect you mentioned back half deliveries, should we expect a bit of a sub-seasonal performance in 2Q before maybe being a bit better seasonal in kind of three in 4Q. How should we just think about all - base in 1Q? Bob Livingston : Yes I think you will see this year that the third quarter is a much stronger seasonal third quarter relative to the other three quarters of the year that we have historically shown. If you look back in history, many years the second quarter has been the strongest quarter, with the third quarter being strong but typically trailing a little bit behind the second quarter. I mean we see that being different issue. We see in the third quarter, June through September are being the strongest shipment period for this business in 2018. And right now we do expect the fourth quarter to show organic growth for the retail refrigeration part of the business. And again I'm going to reference the new awards that have been booked recently. Steve Tusa : Right, okay. And as far as the margin guidance for that segment, I'm not sure you've given that specifically but maybe just some color on how you would expect for the year, its play out for Refrigeration? Bob Livingston : Well, I can't, I don't have it by quarter Steve. Steve Tusa : No, no, just for the year, just color for the year. Bob Livingston : I think we're seating 100 bps of margin improvement for the year. Steve Tusa : Okay. Even with the first quarter start being down? Bob Livingston : Even with the first quarter start. Operator : Your next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks and congratulations Bob. So maybe touching on Steve question there for second on just refrigeration. So I want to make sure that I've got this right. The booking this quarter were down a lot but it sounds like the awards are have been booked, so just like or we're expecting this year? Bob Livingston : No, no, I referenced two new customer wins. We have those contracts in house. But we don't have the releases yet and when they actually want the product shipped, but we do know there will be shipped in the second half of the year. Joe Ritchie : So the awards will then be booked in your backlog sometime in 2Q or 3Q? Bob Livingston : I would expect some of that to be flowing into Q2 and the balance of it in Q3, yes. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's good clarification. And then I may have missed the last comment you made on a 100 basis points on margin expansion. Are you guys talking about refrigeration specifically? Bob Livingston : The segment. Joe Ritchie : The segment. Bob Livingston : Yes. Joe Ritchie : Okay. And that's start to pick up from Acadian perspective in 2Q? Bob Livingston : Q2. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. And then one question on EMV, you saw some softness this quarter. One of your large competitors talked about it last night as well. Maybe talk to it's a little bit about how you expect that to move forward for the rest of the year? Bob Livingston : Well, Brad, you have to clarify if I'm speaking incorrectly here but I don't think our EMV activity in the first quarter was any differ than what we expected and my statement is true. Brad Cerepak : That's true. Bob Livingston : It is interesting that we did see in the first quarter and here you are going to get into the new launches of is it EMV or is it commercial actually normal commercial activity, the order rates were stronger in the first quarter then we had anticipated. Across the board for retail if we like it. And I see across the board, I'm not just referring to our U.S. market. We had stronger booking rates most notably in Asia, especially China and India in the first quarter, but also in Europe, across the board for retail fueling. The order rate increases we're seeing are actually for new dispensers. So, as we get into the second half of the year, we are - our confidence is growing that we are going to see increased EMV activity. But we also know especially as we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and even more so in the first quarter that was just completed, that some of the strong dispenser orders we're getting are for applications or for sites especially here in the U.S. that absent, the purchase of a new dispenser, we would be selling EMV kits. So, we've - we're actually quite pleased with the order activity we had in the first quarter and our confidence is growing that we're going to have a very solid year in retail fueling not just here in there U.S. but globally. Operator : Your next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you, good morning everyone. Hey, Bob I would have thought that you would have timed your farewell to include one last appearance at EPG, how did that does not happen? Bob Livingston : I made a mistake. Deane Dray : Alright, we'll toast you in your absence. Could we talk about the supply chain disruptions, factory consolidation issues in fluids in Europe, just give us a perspective on what is happened and you just try it will be completed in the second quarter, so will it still be disrupted in the second quarter? Bob Livingston : So, it is within the fluid Segment, Deane, you're correct. But to be more specific it's actually within retail fueling. So we as part of integration plan and activity with Tokheim and Wayne, we are in the process of moving production from the Swedish factory which was the Wayne factory into the Dundee, Scotland factory which was the Tokheim-- is the Tokheim factory. And that move I believe actually believe it gets completed in two weeks. Am I right, Brad? Its May, I think it actually gets completed in two weeks. And the - we did incur some additional I would call it overtime and let's just call it move costs in February and March that frankly we didn't have in our forecast. With respect to the supply chain, I don't remember all four parts and it really was restricted to four components that we had some supply interruption with in January and February. I think two of them were fairly much resolved and behind this but a time we exited the first quarter. The other two are being resolved as we are on this stone right now Deane and will be a non-issue but a time we exit the second quarter. And I think you're going to see some fairly significant improvement in margins for this segment in the second quarter. Deane Dray : Got it and then for the follow-up, in engineered systems the comment about industrial businesses having broad base growth beyond the highlighted waste handling business, can you just talk for a moment about these other businesses within industrial? They don't usually get much of your time, but maybe if you could touch on those here that'll be helpful? Bob Livingston : Well again it was broad based; I think I did mention in the script that we saw very solid growth at vehicle services in the first quarter. And I called out industrial ventures which going forward will be in engineered systems, but it was broad based across each of the businesses and the industrial platform. That said I will tell you it was most, the Company that led that platform in growth rates and the first quarter was material handling, they did an outstanding job. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Bob congratulations and good luck. Brad Cerepak : Okay, you have two minutes, because I am leaving at 9 :45. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, I'll be quick then. So, Bob can you talk about the change in free cash guidance, just marginal to 10% from 10% to 11% but cash as you know came in a little late last year in terms of conversion. So and you could sort of read into around working capital movement or maybe just being a little bit more conservative at the start of the year? Bob Livingston : Brad will give you some detail on this, but I look I - we have indicated this pretty strongly, every week, every month, every quarter. Working capital was down again as a percentage of revenue in the first quarter, I think you're going to continue to see that through the balance of the year. But working capital as an absolute dollar amount did increase in the first quarter as a result of some increased inventory and it's totally connected to growth rates. We had really strong growth rates and order rates and engineered systems and in fluids and some of the working capital absolute dollar working capital increase and in the first quarter, are in response to the growth rates. But again as a working capital metric, working capital came down. You want to clarify or add to that? Brad Cerepak : Not clarify but I would add a few points, our first quarter, we characterize as expected slightly negative; splits between I'll call Dover and Apergy about the same levels meaning about 50 :50. And again, if you look at five years trends, we're always somewhat little bit negative to low single-digits in the first quarter, that's traditionally, what we've seen in our first quarter, so nothing unusual there. With respect to last year, I'll just reiterate, when we looked at, last year we came in at about 9%, little over 9%. Again that splits about the same for both companies, so, going forward to 10% called now, I'd say early days, a little bit conservative perhaps but, we think it's a reasonable number as we now go forward on Dover basis ex Apergy. So, we feel like it's a good guide for us. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, that's helpful color. And then obviously, - which might have a different view when he gets into the seat but, are there any more significant actions that you can take in refrigeration, if the weakness in the market persist, if it doesn't come back as you expect, can you do more restructuring in that business? Bob Livingston : Well, number one, I'd tell you we haven't stopped. I don't remember the count, but I know that in the month of March and coming into the first part of April, there were additional right sizing steps taken, within Hill PHOENIX and Anthony. I don't remember the number but I think it was, gosh I think it was about a 110 employment positions that were reduced in March and early April. So we continue to, I think manage the business really well, and I will tell you the business leadership team at Hill PHOENIX and Anthony has done a very good job over the last couple of years. Relaying out the factories, reducing the factories footprint, and I think, I have a lot of confidence, we say little bit of volume growth here in the second half for the year, you're going to see pop in margins from this business that will reflect all of the work that this team has done over the last couple of years. I actually feel very positive about the work they've done. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Winoker with UBS. Steve Winoker : Thanks and good morning, and congrats on your retirement Bob. So just you spoke about the M&A pipeline a bit and the richness of that right now, I guess the couple of questions there, one is to what extend is that a little bit on hold given leadership transition at all? And then secondly, Middleby, others have been very active we've seen a lot of closed deals in food equipment et cetera in the recent quarter, just give us a sense for whether that space is still a priority I suppose going forward, how do you think about it? Bob Livingston : Well, let me correct something, you used the word richness. I didn't use that word. I think our pipeline is fairly active, it is absent at the current time, any significant or large deals, they're all fairly, I call them small to mid-size deals and they're all bolt-on and I would tell you that nothing has slowdown with respect to our pursuit of these opportunities over the last couple of months especially in the last few weeks as we've announced the transition with myself and Rich. And I think you'll hear more from Rich on this topic over the next couple or three quarters I am sure. Steve Winoker : Okay. Fair comments. And on margins, those long-term margin targets is that in place, you've talked a little bit about it now, but just on the road map to those kind of 300 to 400 basis points for fluid and refrigeration and food equipment. What your sense of the kind of achievability in timing of that now? Bob Livingston : I think we're in a good position to achieve those targets in engineered systems and in fluids. As I commented earlier with respect to refrigeration, we need to see this leadership team have a little bit of volume here in the second half of the year, pickup over the first half and I think you'll see those margins are achievable as well. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Scott Graham : Hi, good morning and re-echo of everyone else, Bob, congratulations and good luck and really enjoy your retirement. I'm just - I'd like to go back and revisit that last question because I think it was a prefaced with a long term characterization. Those are 2019 targets right? Bob Livingston : Correct. Scott Graham : So you do feel that with the strong second half you can get to your refrigeration targets in 2019? Bob Livingston : We're referring to the strong second half of 2018, we still have another year. Scott Graham : Right, but there is I guess my broader question is there anything right now that you see and sounds like not but just to ask it directly where you won't at least hit the low end of those targets in 2019? Bob Livingston : No, no. I feel very confident with the bow-end of this target. Brad Cerepak : Yes. But maybe I inject something here because I want to make sure we're talking a lot about the back half here. I just want to maybe set something up here for a second. I want to go back; I know you don't have 2017 on a pro forma basis that will become - Bob Livingston : Not yet. Brad Cerepak : Not yet, but I'm actually going to give it to you right now. But we're going to file an 8-K after the spin and we'll provide all the restated data and you'll have that information. But in 2017 we did $4.15 on a comparable basis to our guide that we're guiding today on an adjusted pro forma basis. The way the year setting up, you think about this way, when you see 2017 you'll see the first half was 44% of our year, the back half was the delta 56%. This year setting up no different. It's - Bob Livingston : It's actually identical. Brad Cerepak : It's identical and so when you think about first half, second half and trajectory the business, yes, DR, FE we have some bookings that we expect in Q2 into Q3 which will make the back half better. By the way on food equipment same thing, we won a big piece of business even food equipment's been a challenging market. I'm talking about matching up with the well builds and Middleby, we feel really good about that business and we said this heat exchange your business is going to have an awesome year. And so we feel good about that. The last piece I would say just again you have this data it's coming out. Our first quarter, the way our first quarter on a pro forma ex-Apergy basis will look versus the $1.16 is $0.90. And we're right on pace where we want to be. Our guide hasn't changed; our guide paused for Dover ex Apergy hasn't changed. Our core growth is up 1% on the revenue side. Our segment margin expectation guide to guide on a pro forma basis hasn't changed. There's a little bit of a change in corporate that we talked about, offset by a little bit of interest savings as we paid down the $350 million of debt due in the first quarter. And a little bit of benefit on tax and shares. And that's how our guide sets up. So we're really sitting here today with fundamentally the first quarter as we expected the mix shift is different within the segments. And the trajectory of the business feels good to us. Bob Livingston : And I echo that strongly. Scott Graham : Brad that was usually helpful thanks you. I do want to maybe just go back and maybe try to understand price cost where you said that about $10 million of your $14 million, which I assume was positive price cost if I remember that correctly that is $4 million left and you're out there increasing prices so I need to triangulate here a little bit because first quarter inflation certain commodities obviously the metals complex was pretty significant. So are you saying that you are $4 million positive price cost on an annualized basis today? Bob Livingston : Yes, without further inflation, yes. Scott Graham : So then your price increases will make you price cost positive in 2018? Bob Livingston : Slightly, slightly. Scott Graham : Very good, thanks, that's all I had. Brad Cerepak : Yes, impacts the margin rate a bit but yes, marginally price positive again. Again, as Bob said, we got ahead of the curve on this and that's where we still see ourselves at this point. Bob Livingston : And it was different than what we experienced last year. I would say across the board here in Dover, the price increases, they weren't all done on the same day, but the companies all pursue this during their first quarter and we feel fairly comfortable with the position we are with respect to pricing as it exist today for the second or third quarters. Scott Graham : Very good. I appreciate your comprehensive responses there and again good luck to you, Bob. Operator : Your final question is from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Robert Barry : Hey, guys. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I will also conclude with echoing the congrats to Bob. Good luck. Just a few follow-ups at this point, on the inefficiencies in retail fueling can you say how much that cost you in the quarter? And was that also a revenue headwind because you couldn't ship? Bob Livingston : It was a slight revenue headwind. I don't want to make a big deal of the additional revenue but I mean it may have been. It may have been $5 million, $6 million or $7 million, it wasn't a game changer. It did cause us to incur some additional cost on express freight and some overtime. Robert Barry : Got it. Got it. And following up on something Brad said earlier about feeling particularly good about Food Equipment business those lines up well build and Middleby. I know that's been kind of challenging for a little while is that - do you think that end market there is finally starting to show some traction? Bob Livingston : I would say it's spotty. I think with some customers - we see some customers buying that or buying more that they were last year, but I would say it's not broad based. We're actually looking at growth within this part of the business for the year. But it's all around special projects and special orders. And I would also tell you they are all on the books. We have the orders in house. But we see a fairly good growth rate in this part of the business in the second half of the year. Robert Barry : Got it. Just one last kind of big picture question. Are you guy hearing anything from customers about using past savings or new depreciation rules to step up investments at this point? Bob Livingston : We keep asking that question internally as well. And it's difficult. It's difficult to pin in order to the taxable changes. Robert Barry : Got it. So not clear yet that it's helping? Bob Livingston : Correct Operator : Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for his closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : Yes. So this concludes our conference call. With that, we thank you for your continued interest in Dover. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks again for your interest. Bye. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's First Quarter 2018 Dover Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

Paul Goldberg : Thank you, Crystal. Good morning and welcome to Dover's second quarter earnings call. With me today are Rich Tobin and Brad Cerepak. Today's call will begin with comments from Rich and Brad on Dover's second quarter operating and financial performance and some comments on our 2018 outlook. We will then open the call up for questions. As a courtesy, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with a follow-up. Dover is providing non-GAAP measures including EPS results and EPS guidance that exclude after-tax related amortization. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures reflecting adjustments for aforementioned acquisition-related amortization, rightsizing costs and other costs are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials. Please note that our current earnings release, investor supplement and associated presentation can be found on our website dovercorporation.com. This call will be available for playback through August 2nd and the audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for three months. The replay telephone number is (800) 585-8367. When accessing the playback, you'll need to supply the following access code 3666317. Before we get started today, I'd like to remind everyone that our comments today which are intended to supplement your understanding of Dover may contain certain forward-looking statements that are inherently subject to uncertainties. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any such forward-looking statement. Also we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. We would also direct your attention to our website where considerably more information can be found. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks Paul, good morning everybody and thanks for joining us for this morning's conference call, let's get started. In Q2, Dover posted consolidated revenue up 3% with adjusted earnings of $200 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.30 a share, up 19% and 21% respectively. Bookings remained solid at $1.9 billion at the end of the quarter and are broad-based across the portfolio excluding retail refrigeration. The Apergy spin-off is completed at the beginning of the quarter and as a result we have executed a good portion of the announced share repurchase program which Brad will take you through, the impact on the share count later in the deck. We are tightening the full-year EPS guidance range to $4.75 to $4.85 a share despite the full-year demand environment and retail refrigeration being below our original forecast and largely as a result of improved margin conversion in the Fluids segment expected in Q4, tight corporate cost controls, and share count reduction. As we have noted in the press release this morning, we will be implementing a cost reduction program beginning in Q3 which is not reflected in our current full-year EPS guidance and will be subject to a separate announcement I will deal with that, I think, in the Q&A. So let's go on in the presentation, let me pass it off to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks Rich. Good morning everyone. Let's start on Page 4 of the presentation deck. As mentioned, our results were largely driven by solid demand in Engineered Systems and Fluids. Overall revenue grew 3% to $1.8 billion. Adjusted segment EBIT improved to $276 million and adjusted margin was essentially flat at 15.3%. This performance reflected solid conversion in Engineered Systems which was offset by continued footprint consolidation supply chain issues in Fluids and lower volume in Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $343 million. Adjusted earnings increased 19% to $200 million. And adjusted EPS was $1.30. The EPS benefited from a slightly lower tax rate on discrete tax benefits whereas the full-year effective tax rate is expected to be between 21% and 22%. On Slide 5, let's get into a little bit more detail on our revenue and bookings results in the quarter. Second quarter revenue growth of 3% was comprised of 3% organic growth and 2% from FX. Partially offsetting these results was a 2% impact from net dispositions. Importantly on a sequential basis, organic growth accelerated from 1.7% in Q1 to 3.5% in Q2. FX which was a tailwind of about 4% in Q1 decelerated into Q2 to about 2% as a result of the U.S. dollar appreciating against our other trading currencies. We are using a U.S. dollar Euro assumption of $1.17 in our current full-year forecast. From a segment perspective, Engineered Systems grew $39 million organically and Fluids grew $44 million. Weak retail refrigeration markets drove a $24 million decline in Refrigeration & Food Equipments revenue. Booking increased 6% overall. Organic growth was 6%. Of note Engineered Systems and Fluids organic bookings grew $62 million and $80 million respectively reflecting broad-based market demand. From a geographics perspective, the U.S. our largest market grew 2% organically while Europe was up 1%, Asia grew 19% largely driven by strong activity in our Fluids segment. Finally book to bill finished at 1.05. Let's go to the earnings bridge now on Slide 6. Starting on the top, Engineered Systems adjusted segment EBIT improved $15 million largely driven by solid conversion on broad-based revenue growth. Fluids EBIT growth of $7 million reflects weak conversion due to footprint consolidation and supply chain issues. The $15 million decline at Refrigeration & Food Equipment reflected lower volume. Going to the bottom of the chart, adjusted earnings improved $32 million or 19%, higher segment earnings, lower interest, and corporate costs and a lower tax rate drove the improvement. Let's look at Slide 7. Our first half free cash flow was $79 million or 28% of earnings from continuing ops. Second quarter free cash flow was largely in line with last year. Our CapEx spending was focused on multiple projects which will help drive growth and productivity. Working capital increased $59 million on volume growth although working capital as a percent of revenue came down 130 basis points to 16% of revenue. Now on Slide 8. As previously mentioned during the second quarter we initiated an accelerated repurchase program funded by the $700 million Apergy dividend. Beyond the completion of the ASR, we expect to repurchase 150 million more in shares in the second half on the open market. By year-end, we will substantially complete the 1 billion repurchase we committed to last year. And as you know, the ending full-year 2018 weighted average drops further into 2019 on these 2018 repurchases. With that, let me turn it back over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks Brad. Let's move on to the segment slides. Engineered Systems delivered a solid broad-based quarter. Margin conversion organic revenue was very good at 46% in the period a result of the following. In printing and identification the positive comparable performance was driven by volume growth in Markem-Imaje and improved product mix in digital print as a result of the timing of LaRio printer deliveries which should have been expected in Q3 but delivered in Q2. In the Industrial platform, performance was more mixed as they are more subjected to material cost and tariff issues. ESG and TWG both delivered very strong performances as a result of the continued demand strength in fleet renewal in ESG and recovery vehicle accessories demand in TWG, with volume leverage and mix more than offsetting input cost headwinds in both businesses. DESTACO and MPG delivered good results on volume and improved mix on the back of automation demand and an uptick in military spending. While VSG reported absolute profits up for the quarter incremental margins were lower than expected as volume leverage and pricing were unable to cover input cost increases as a result of the delays in pricing and implementation which is being enacted going into H2. Full-year outlook for Engineered Systems is expected to remain strong with earnings levered towards Q4 as a result of industrial facility maintenance shutdowns primarily in Europe in Q3 and the timing of digital print large printer shipments pulled into Q2. Okay, let\u2019s go forward to Fluids. The Fluids segment posted organic revenue growth of 7% during the quarter with all operating companies growing revenue from comparable period with especially improved performances in our pumps, process solutions, and transport businesses. Consolidated margin performance for the segment was underwhelming as a result of the execution issues in fueling and transport specifically in DFS partially offsetting strong performances in the balance of the segment. Let me comment on some of the strong results in the segment because it's a little bit of a tale of two worlds here. In pumps and process solutions, PSG colder hydro and to a lesser extent MAG all delivered top-line and bottom line conversion in the quarter. PSG's June shipment rate was the highest in three years which is a positive sign that our CapEx levered businesses continue to gain strength. The colder business has had a strong start to the year which continued through Q2 this is becoming a business of significant attraction in the segments portfolio and one that is earmarked for capacity expansion. Results in fueling and transport were mixed. OPW was the fastest growing business at 23% largely driven by regulatory related spending in China and U.S. below ground products. Margin conversion could have been better as a result of facility consolidation costs which we consider transitory and beneficial to margins going forward and a geographic mix of revenue with APAC revenue being dilutive to consolidated margins. The expectation is that OPW will have a solid second half as end market demand remains firm. DFS while posting top-line growth of 3% posted negative earnings conversion as a result of the continued operational costs associated with the European footprint consolidation, significant supply chain costs and expediting fees, and discrete items in the quarter. Our expectation is that a significant portion of these issues will be behind us by the end of Q3 and that the second half performance will be materially improved going into Q4. What I can tell you is that during the quarter we did the operational issues and discrete items that cost us approximately $7 million of earnings and if I add that back to our margins, there still remains much to do to get margins on track in this business. The encouraging news is that we're confident it's not a product issue from the performance perspective as bench -- product benchmarking and customer feedback is positive. And it's clear that our operational execution has to improve and we have to establish and execute clear paths for profit improvement plans in Europe and APAC which are underway. Let's move on to Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Refrigeration & Food Equipment had another tough quarter in Q2 as revenue was down 6% primarily driven by reduced demand trends especially in Dover Food Retail and calendarization of shipments out of food equipment particularly at Belvac which are back-end loaded in 2018 to Q4. We have updated our full-year forecast for this segment and align with the current backlog and demand trends. EBITDA margin in the quarter declined over 200 basis points or $15 million on reduced earnings in Dover Food Retail, $14 million in Belvac and $4 million on a comparable basis. Our expectations that a full-year demand will remain weak in Dover Food Retail through the balance of the year but for comparable segment margin declines to narrow in Q3 and refuse -- and reverse in Q4 as a result of improving shipment mix in United Brands through H2, Belvac and Belvac shipments in Q4 and the flow through of cost actions in Dover Food Retail which has reduced its year-over-year headcount by 18% through June. Moving on to Slide 14, as I mentioned earlier in the presentation, we've updated our full-year revenue outlook to reflect softer than forecasted demand conditions in Retail Refrigeration and tightened our range on the EPS to the higher end of the range with a bias towards the top end. Our revenue trends and backlogs indicate we have strong businesses that are largely participating in markets with increased demand profiles. It is clear that we need to execute on better margin conversion in some areas of our portfolio and to aggressively implement actions to offset raw material and input inflation. During the last 90 days, I have visited approximately 70% of our total company revenue and our management teams in the quarter. The commitment to deliver improved performances there and we are committed to implementing the necessary actions to achieve it. That's the last slide, so we will move on to Q&A. Paul Goldberg : Thanks. Crystal, if we can have the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Welcome to Richard and thank you for the candid tone. In terms of I guess any extra color you could provide on the cost reduction measures that you've talked about in terms of magnitude and perhaps also speed of execution and how quickly investors should expect to see a meaningful payback on those cost reduction efforts. Richard Tobin : We\u2019re well through our plans. I expect that our plans will be complete by mid-August from there we will work on the accounting treatment quite frankly because there's some issues we have to deal with war notices and a variety of other things. Before the end of Q3, we'll be announcing the timing of those measures, the cost of those measures, and the flow through on our cost going into 2019 as a separate announcement, but I guess in a nutshell we're well under way at this point. I'm confident in our ability to execute and I think as a clarifying point what I've written in the press release, it said overhead, and I don't want to confuse that with what has gone on here before about rightsizing if you will nor do I want you to think of that as corporate cost. This is SG&A across the group including the SG&A in the segment, so the scale of this rightsizing initiative will be materially larger than some of the rightsizing initiatives that we have seen as a result of the Apergy spinoff. Julian Mitchell : Understood, thank you. And then my second and last question would just be around the Refrigeration & Food business and then I guess you\u2019ve obviously done a lot of cost measures already at food retail. It seems like you\u2019ve obviously decided to keep the business in light of the reviews you've done in recent months, maybe talk a little bit about your impressions on the longer-term sales growth outlook in Refrigeration & Food overall and how that informs the scale of necessary cost reduction? Richard Tobin : The cost reduction initiatives are solely in retail refrigeration because that really is the part of the portfolio that's suffering the revenue decline. I think from an earnings point of view both UB, UB is on track for the full-year. I think that we've got some calendarization differences running through the P&L right now in Belvac. So if you look at the segment performance, it's negative to a certain extent because of Belvac, our backlog in Belvac is impressive right now it's purely a question of the timing of the deliveries right now they're loaded into Q4 and that's why in my commentary, I'd said that the comparable performance for the segment actually rolls over in Q4 where we expected to be positive which is largely as a result of the cost takeout in retail refrigeration and the shipments in Belvac. So in terms of the portfolio review and the decision about keeping anything I mean we've gone through the portfolio review in terms of what we can expect about medium term performance but there's been no real decisions about a greater portfolio decision at this point. I think that I understand that there is this issue of well why don't we spinout refrigeration or monetize refrigeration, monetizing the business at it -- at its current demand levels. I'm not so sure about that from a decision point of view. So I think what we're doing right now is rightsizing that business in terms of what we believe the demand is going to be for the balance of the year. We'll have a better idea as we go through Q3 of what we expect to happen in 2019 and we're committed to making sure that that we maximize the segment profitability for that period. In terms of what we're going to do from a portfolio point of view I think that's a future consideration. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Good morning Rich. Good morning, Paul. A long, long time, good morning Brad, long time I didn\u2019t see you. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Richard Tobin : Yes, long time Andrew. Andrew Obin : So the question is I guess question for Rich as you move from the board to the CEO position and I know you sort of highlighted SG&A moves, are there any obvious things other than SG&A in terms of how the company run that you have seen as a target for improvement and the second part of my question, how long would it take for you would think to sort of steady the operation that Dover moves them in the direction where you want for you can sort of restart thinking about using the balance sheets strategically i.e. M&A? Richard Tobin : Okay, I think there's two primary issues. One is clearly that the expectation of demand in retail refrigeration of what we thought it was going to be at the beginning of the year and what it's likely turning out to be for 2018 is significantly different and that goes through 2019. So I believe that we're reaching the bottom from what I've can ascertain so far but right now we're moving as quickly as we can to intervene on the cost space to protect margins as they are. We'll make further decisions based on as I mentioned the previous question about where as we stack up on, we're taking a lot of costs out right now, we\u2019re incurring those costs of the P&L of what kind of on the run margin profile is for retail refrigeration but a variety of demand scenarios into 2019 but clearly that's a significant difference between what we had thought at the beginning of the year and what it's turned out to be, so it's up to us to action that and quite frankly, segment management has been doing a lot of heavy lifting, so I can't criticize the execution of the cost takeout year-to-date. The other issue is the execution on the facility consolidation in DFS and the margin profile of that portion of the Fluids segment has been disappointing. This has been ongoing for some period of time. I think it is demonstrated that there are some gaps in the organization about handling facility consolidation and complex industrial moves and we're paying the price for that. So right now in terms of margin of dilution accretion, we've got a significant portion of the Fluid segment that is very dilutive to the balance of the portfolio and that's a problem. We're getting our hands around about on the run profitability for that segment, if I can strip out some of the noise. But we're not moving fast enough in my mind in terms of the execution. I think that we will make some progress in Q3, so comparable earnings trajectory versus the first half move up in H2 but we're still far away from expectation in terms of the margin of that business and it's significant to our revenue stream, so it's something that that we need to fix and I think that that is going to undertake us bringing in a mix of some other kind of talents into the group to ensure that because there is other footprint initiatives that I think that will be coming through 2019 and we just got to do a better job of executing there. In terms of inorganic investment this is not a scenario of while we're going to go through a cleanup period here and then we're going to come out of the other side. We're still looking at inorganic opportunity and the balance of the portfolio we've got certain portions of our business that are executing very well I mean I highlighted some of them in the opening commentary. We're looking at a few right now and the scale in terms of purchase price is somewhere, it\u2019s less than $0.5 billion but more in the $250 million range. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. Hey Rich thanks for all the color on kind of the operational and CEO kind of new view just on the maybe some of the more kind of practical near-term operational things, can you just give us a little color on really what the supply chain disruptions are, how do you tackle those and also just a little bit of an update on what is happening on price cost in particular your efforts to get price in the business? Richard Tobin : Sure. For the most part in supply chain issues that we've had, that have been negative to earnings have been mostly isolated in Fluids and almost exclusively in DFS. And that is part and parcel to this facility consolidation to a certain extent and trying to manage our SNL pieces systems of getting the right product out. So we've had a bunch of frictional costs associated that whether that's freight expediting. On the balance of the group, it's being reflected in working capital performance where I think that the supply chains in certain parts of the business have been somewhat strained. I think in certain areas we've tried to buy forward a little bit on the industrial businesses for steel to kind of mask price increases to a certain extent and that really needs to be normalized going to the second half because we're not entirely pleased with the cash flow performance year-to-date. So those are really two of the areas where it's manifesting itself. Jeffrey Sprague : And how about on price attempts specifically Rich, how is the market accepting that, is there kind of negative demand response when attempting to get price or any blow back anywhere on that? Richard Tobin : Yes, we've got a pretty mixed portfolio, so any answer I give you is going to be kind of mixed, I mean I think that we've estimated that our commodity headwind is approximately $55 million or so, that needs to be offset in price. Clearly in the business, I called out VSG where we've been negative so far and that's a little bit because of -- that's a distribution business and there's a pal on kind of rolling that into distribution which we're committed to fixing in the second half of the year. The other businesses like TWG and ESG which are heavily levered towards commodity prices because of the demand profile has been there. They're doing reasonably well on price and they're offsetting the balance because of the volume leverage on the industrial side. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Steve Tusa : Thanks for the abbreviated script and a lot of time for Q&A. We appreciate that. On the free cash flow, you mentioned you just mentioned some working capital. I know the prior guidance was 10% of revenue, well, I know you have a big second half usually can you maybe just update us on that metric for the year and then may be little color on how that may improve in the next couple of years and just a quick follow-up on that. Richard Tobin : I'll take the time to avoid the next couple of years Steve for the time being. Steve Tusa : Okay. Richard Tobin : I can deal with that in Q3 but let's deal with between now and the end of the year. I'm not aware of anything that's changed in the dynamic or the cash flow dynamic of the business right now. So I'm not taking 10% of revenue off the table by any means. Clearly as I'm sure you\u2019ve heard during the Q3 commentary we did -- we are backend loaded in certain of our businesses and that would imply that receivable balances in Q4 may be going up but that, so we're going to have to work pretty hard in terms of the industrial inventory and payables to offset that, but I don't see any fundamental change that we've moved to at a heavier profile in terms of inventory or cash conversion but getting into kind of doing the timing quarter-by-quarter, it's hard for me to say right now I've gone through it at the Opco level, I think any kind of fluctuation in that is going to be based on timing of receivable balances and at the end of the year we're shipping out a bunch of LaRio machines and shipping out a lot of Belvac, I mean that's going to be negative unless we can carry some payables to offset into it. But right now I don't see any reason to come off 10% of revenue in terms of a target. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just a quick one on RF&E you talked about taking rightsizing actions I don't see really any restructuring in the quarter at refrigeration is that because a lot of the plan that you're going to kind of come up with and announce it's more kind of let's put stop saying let's evaluate and that would be a big part of kind of what we hear about in Q3 like kind of a calm before the storm if you will? Richard Tobin : A little bit less those than you think, I think that that the rightsizing that's been going on in refrigeration has been flowing through the P&L and it's on the variable labor side more than anything else I think that what we're going to do in the segment is take a look at the footprint because the footprint is probably well it is right now at current demand levels a lot larger than we would need, so there's going to be a part of that in it but to be clear the restructuring that we're going to announce in Q3 is not -- is more of a group wide SG&A reduction there will be some amount of footprint in it but quite frankly I think that the footprint decisions are going to take a little longer and that'll be done I don't want to say separately but I mean as you can imagine you need to prepare a supply chains and do a variety of other things to deal with a footprint so a lot of that will probably go into 2019. What we're going to do in this coming quarter is take a look at across all of the segments, so group wide SG&A because clearly as we've taken a look at the benchmarking versus our peer set, we\u2019re a bit heavy I think we've done a lot of work in the past to put in systems to allow us to take out some non-customer facing kind of costs and that's what we're going to do. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker with UBS. Steve Winoker : Thanks very much, good morning and thanks for the color this is really helpful across the business. I just wanted to start with a little bit more of that operational review that you had across the whole business you've talked about, hitting 70% of the revenue base, you\u2019ve talked about SG&A and some of the supply chain issues but to what extent is there sort of a broader operational and lean opportunity when you see about -- see how the businesses are working, do you think these are really just isolated incidents or is this more of an opportunity kind of rethinking the operations of the business forward on a portfolio basis? Richard Tobin : Yes, I think that right now we are concentrating on the actionable items, so SG&A clearly as an actionable, addressable item and as we have mentioned we've got some pretty big execution issues that we need to deal with in DFS and DFS as a material portion of our total group revenues and clearly we're kind of swimming upstream a little bit on retail refrigeration until that business stabilizes itself, so there is a lot we can do in terms of operational performance. That it's going to require that's but that is more of a sustained kind of grinded out effort. So I mean it's not something that we can turn the dial between now and the end of the year. I think other than just begin to turn it philosophically. But in my going around I think that that we do need to bring into some of our businesses some expertise in terms of operational efficiency. I think we do a fantastic job of keeping close to the customer. I think we do a really good job in terms of new product development, so kind of close to the customer and developing the products which is reflected in our top-line which has been very competitive against our peer set. I think that part of it we do quite well I think that we just need to take that kind of effort and turn some of it back in terms of operational execution. But that is something that is we can put it in it as an ethos between now and the end of the year but we're going to have to grind that out and that's more of a 18 months before we really get on a cadence that I'd like to see it out. Steve Winoker : Okay. And just to clarify on the comment this morning when you talk about asset intensity, you mean driving higher asset utilization across the business. Richard Tobin : Yes, yes, absolutely, absolutely. Steve Winoker : Okay. Richard Tobin : I won't use intensity again we're not going to become more asset heavy. We are going to sweat the assets that we have more intensely. Steve Winoker : Perfect and then so I had to get that in but on the EMV side, can you just talk to us a little bit about EMV growth. Richard Tobin : Somewhere in this pile here is the chart where do we say we were on EMV penetration 40%? Brad Cerepak : Yes, roughly 40% that's hard -- that's hard to know because we're seeing more and more -- we're seeing more and more new dispensers a lot of customers are looking at the age of the dispenser in the field and making decisions about earlier upgrade and maybe they normally would do and we're seeing that manifest itself in order rates on dispensers. The first half as you know was a challenging first half as EMV last year was pretty solid in terms of kits and conversions. The back half we'll see that more to dispenser, so but roughly speaking the number Rich gave is about where we think we are with a lot of room to consumer to run here in the back half into 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone and welcome Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Deane Dray : Hey maybe we can start with what you're thinking and I know it's a moving target regarding potential tariff exposures and you mentioned $55 million in commodity headwinds you need to offset but any color there for starters would be helpful? Richard Tobin : The $55 million is a mixed number which is, it's got tariff in there and it's got price escalation right and parsing that out -- Brad Cerepak : It's small. Richard Tobin : Yes, parsing that out is relatively difficult. We are keeping a close look at our exposure to China in terms of our revenue base clearly and not only our exposure from a revenue point of view but also the mismatch between what we make in China and selling to China versus what we import exports. So we're running the traps on all of that it looks manageable at this point, so I don't see any significant issue. I'd like to see our Asia-Pac margins move up group wide a little bit but and I\u2019d mention that in the color around LPW but at the end of the day from a growth point of view it's from a absolute profit point of view we will take it, so we're running the traps on both kind of tariff scenarios but for us right now it's less tariff and more commodity cost headwinds and then it's just a challenge for us to offset it between price and productivity. Deane Dray : Got it. And then, Rich, I appreciate that we're still early in your tenure and you're laying out some broad strokes on the operating side and what needs fixing, but can you address capital allocation broadly? You mentioned that you're not going to stop on acquisitions. You're looking at $250 million to $500 million-sized deals. But broadly, how are you thinking about return requirements? Are there any changes that we should be sensitive to in terms of how you're looking at capital allocation broadly? Richard Tobin : Right. We're looking closely at it. We -- I'm very cognizant that everyone is looking for a structured answer from me on that, our intent is hopefully before the end of Q3 around the close of Q3 that we're going to come out and I'll give you a whole presentation in terms of my thoughts on capital allocation in the short-term Brad alluded to what we're doing in terms of the share repurchase as, a) it was a commitment in the past but it's a relative valuation play at the same time, so I think we've given you a lot of color in terms of our intent there. But I understand that everybody is waiting to hear from me about capital allocation and I'm working on the presentation as we speak. Deane Dray : Understand we'll be patient. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : So when you look at refrigeration, I know there has been a few questions there but it's been a couple of years where it's been little tougher go over so when you look this quarter I know Bob had talked last quarter about a couple of new customers coming in and booking more, what\u2019s happening in the business, what is worse? The CapEx environment we all know looks weak but Bob had talked about specialty store growth so what -- it just seems like it's a moving target and what should it look like from here are you think that, where we are in terms of guidance is pretty conservative now, Rich. Richard Tobin : I hope it's conservative. I guess maybe we're talking about retail refrigeration. I think when we look at the segment. It's going to have enough it's going to have a tough Q3 and then -- these are comparable numbers now it\u2019s going have a tough Q3. And then it's going to roll over in Q4 because quite frankly the comps get better and as I mentioned the non-retail refrigeration portion of the portfolio is backend loaded right now based on our forecast, so you're going to get that kind of uptick. But the fact of the matter is we're nothing's really changed, we're in a bit of a CapEx strike by food retail as everybody struggles with the digitization and what they're going to do to react to that. It is clearly below replacement demand now so I wouldn't say does it get worse from here, I don't think that it gets worse from here but we don't see a runway for it to get demonstrably better other than to run the trap lines to say at some point maintenance capital, replacement capital has got to come back so but clearly the proportion of new build to replacement build is changed forever to a certain extent and we're going to have to size ourselves based on that. In terms of other revenues streams there you guys you could imagine we are working strenuously to diversify the business from case and door to other products within in food retail. I think that we've got some interesting irons in the fire in that regard but they are not going to impact earnings in 2018. And assumes we can put some color around it and I'm sure you'll hear from us about it but for the medium term this is all hands on deck of rightsizing ensuring that our quality remains best in class setting ourselves up for even at flat revenue we actually make comparable profits go up because of cost takeout and then working strenuously in kind of diversified the revenue stream from a product point of view. Andrew Kaplowitz : That\u2019s helpful. Then if you just back up last year this time or maybe early in the last summer and there was an Analyst Day Bob had talked about some of these long-term growth guidance for the different segments obviously refrigeration has changed but when you look at ES and Fluids you've laid out 3% to 5% growth and it looks like ES have been pretty strong so as you've looked at the overall segments Rich in terms of growth is that the way you\u2019ve looked at ES and Fluids look solid versus that 3% to 5% growth or situation looks little worse any comments on how those targets that were set last year? Richard Tobin : Yes, I know that there's a need or everybody wants me to reconcile the 2019 targets. I can just guess and I've looked at them closely. Clearly as you articulated both Fluids -- all right let's go back Engineering Systems from a top-line growth and a margin accretion point of view is largely on track. Fluids because of the negative conversion in DFS is problematic and I think we've beaten this issue of food retail. I'm more of a consolidated margin person, this is a portfolio there's going to be ups and downs in terms of the demand cycle in the portfolio but if I look at it from a consolidated point of view part of the reason that we're taking this action in terms of overhead costs is to close that gap which is a portion of it is our execution issues that we have in DFS that need to be reconciled and more importantly the headwinds that we have on refrigeration. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Charley Brady with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Charley Brady : Just on a bigger picture you talked about you particularly in refrigeration and I guess more fluids bringing some more talent on the operational execution issue, do you think as you and I know it's a little bit far to 2019 but these type of things generally take a bit more time you've got to bring people and you've got to get the plan in place and you've got to execute. I mean as we look from a margin perspective particularly on that DFS business and more into refrigeration do you see kind of going through 2019 before you and exiting 2019 before you see any real meaningful margin improvement there or should we expect it sooner than that timeframe trying to get a framework of how long do we see sort of some of these subpar margins in parts of the business before they start getting really better on the plan you going to put in place. Richard Tobin : Right. As I mentioned earlier from an execution point of view on refrigeration and the actions that have been taken on the cost basis I'm confident that the plans are in place for the comparable margin to rise it's purely a question of demand so it's a top-line issue, right, so I think that's the segment management is on it from a cost point of view it's not there's not an execution issue going on in retail refrigeration it's more of -- it's got a significant top-line headwind and because of that your fixed cost absorption becomes problematic, so it's easy you know what they've done up until this point is do with a variable cost which they take through the P&Ls on a comparable basis even a flat revenues it actually moves up going into 2019. And then it's clear that we're probably going to have to take some action in terms of the fixed cost in that business to right size it based on future demand. We're not there yet because I'm not I think we need to see some stabilization in terms of the demand profile on that portion of the business. On DFS I can tell you that if I clear out of the noise of the facility consolidation and everything else it's a material amount of earnings increase at flat revenue. But I'll also tell you that the profit margin even if I clear out the noise is unacceptable from a comp base. And that is likely to take, I think we will make improvement I think you're going to see some improvements in the second half of this year largely in Q4, I think that you'll see improvement assuming we clear out the noise which we're committed to doing in 2019 but it\u2019s going to likely take throughout 2019 to materially get this closer to benchmark profitability which is our target. Charley Brady : Understood thanks and just one more quick one on, you talked about one of the things you think you guys are pretty good at are new product development that doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue but I\u2019m wondering if you look across the portfolio, are there areas where things may have been under invested in terms of new product development and that's an area that need a little more focus or is that kind of squared up across the board? Richard Tobin : It\u2019s such a mixed bag, I think it's very difficult to answer, I think by and large as I mentioned before the customer facing portion of the business is executing. So and that includes new product development, right a lot of what we do is I would almost classify as co-engineering in a lot of cases. I think from an investment point of view, if there's been any opportunity in terms of investment it would be at the industrial level and that's a productivity issue, right. So there may be some amount of flex of investing in the industrial footprint to derive future productivity out of it and be less labor intensive in some of our more industrial businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mircea Dobre with Baird. Mircea Dobre : Yes, good morning and welcome Rich. If I may, I\u2019d like to maybe ask you kind of a longer-term question if you're looking out three to four years I mean I certainly understand what you're trying to do from a cost reduction in restructuring standpoint in the near-term but what is your sense on where the biggest opportunity for value creation would be in the company, is it on self help driving margins or is it more along the capital deployment portfolio management side? Richard Tobin : In the -- in the near-term it's driven by self-help and in the longer-term it moves more into investing where we are advantaged from a market structure point of view and we believe that we've got advantage. So over the next 18 months, I think it's more of operational execution and self-help I think that I've basically pointed my finger of where we believe that the biggest material changes can take place. But over the -- but at a certain point if we execute on that then it becomes more of an issue of capital allocation and allocating our capital where we believe that we\u2019re structurally advantaged in terms of whether it's market structure or product or a variety of other considerations. So but it's not to say I think I should repeat myself that we're going into some kind of black period where we're going to almost exclusively concentrate on execution issues, I think that we're able to do a little bit of both. So we are going to be considering inorganic investment over that period of time. So it's not a black white, so if you're asking a longer term question I think that once we get beyond kind of some of the operational challenges that we have in front of us then I think it becomes more of a -- are we going to be a disciplined allocator of capital. And I think we're committed to doing so. Mircea Dobre : I see. And then maybe clarification on guidance, if you're willing to provide it, can you comment at all on how you\u2019re thinking about segment margins for the full-year by each segment? Richard Tobin : No, I won't give you segment margin for the whole year I think that if you go back and you look of what my comments were I think that I've given a good amount of color in terms of what our expectations are by segment in terms of calendarization between Q3 and Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Rich, it sounds just maybe just asking the margin longer-term margin guidance question directly, it sounds like we've talked a little bit about bridging the gap to what the old targets were for 2019, when do you think you're going to be in a position to either affirm or provide new margin guidance on a longer-term basis? Richard Tobin : No, I think that what I alluded to before about coming out and doing let\u2019s call it a Capital Markets Day for lack of better word about presenting something about capital allocation clearly as part of that it's going to be something about what we think about future margin performance is going to be. I just need some time to get it all sorted and I think it's important that we have a definitive answer in terms of the costs and the role forward about the actions that we\u2019re going to be taking in the next 90 days as part of that presentation. Joe Ritchie : Got it, that makes sense and following up maybe on that question earlier on asset intensity and running your assets harder, I'd be curious just based on your first few months on the job, how do you evaluate the level of investment that\u2019s been made across the businesses and what and whether you have to make incremental investments in your assets to drive better productivity? Richard Tobin : I think that the opposite. As you're aware, I think that the asset base of Dover is diverse, I think to be kind. So there is ample slack capacity throughout the group and even if you drove down that by operating coming in second and everything else. So I think that there is an amount of opportunity if we're talking about driving longer-term productivity of changing the profile of some of our industrial assets to make them less labor intensive over time. But I think that the payback on those investments will be solid. But it is very much a mixed bag between how old the assets are and whether they\u2019re industrial assets or non-industrial in terms of their profile. So it's -- I'll just give you anecdotal comments but there are opportunities, if we're confident about the revenue streams going forward and the volume for some amount of automation that may require some amount of CapEx but quite frankly I don't think it's going to flex CapEx of revenue as a percentage of revenue demonstratively and I think that the payback will be satisfactory. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Helpful, if I could sneak one more in just on price cost. But just on price cost, it looks like you got in roughly $25 million or so price in the first half of the year, you're talking about $55 million or so of commodity inflation for the year, I'm just curious is the expectation in the back half of the year that price cost is going to be positive based on what you know today just completely offsetting or how are you guys thinking about it within the guide? Richard Tobin : I think neutral is the best answer I can give you, I mean you got so much flex in mix going into the second half and a lot of comparable performance changes. Clearly, we didn't I think that DES in most of their industrial businesses did a great job in Q2 or some high value shipments but we got out the door quickly. So from a comparative basis, we're going to be really leaning on DFS in Q3 and really leaning on DFS and retail refrigeration from a comp basis in Q4 and because of retail refrigeration not retail refrigeration because of DFR being reliant upon Belvac in Q4 which are low shipments in number but very lucrative in terms of its margin profile. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Graham with BMO Capital Markets. Scott Graham : So we've seen, in the past, facility consolidation issues. We've seen supply chain issues. These are, unfortunately, not new things. So what I'm wondering here is, as we look to slim down improved processes, what is the risk that 2019 becomes one of the -- those infamous transition years for you guys? Richard Tobin : I don\u2019t want it to be my transition. So I think the commitment of clearly from an execution point of view in DFS, I can't speak to the past. I can just speak to what we're dealing with right now; I think that we could have handled this better, right. I think that I'll put it in my lap; I know how to do that stuff. So I think that it's just a question of doing the preparation beforehand and executing on the plan. And just so I think also as I mentioned that we are going to be taking the industrial footprint but over the course of the next 18 months. And we may have targeted actions there but what I can assure you is, is that when we take those actions that will tell you upfront what the cost is going to be and what the timeline of the execution is and it's not going to be modeled in kind of on the run results. Scott Graham : So it's entirely possible that, let's say, for example, the first half of next year could be a little, for lack of a better term, squishy off of what you're trying to do over the next 2018? Richard Tobin : I'd like is it possible, I don't think so. I guess is my answer right I mean I think if it\u2019s squishy let's take an example. If we want to intervene in 2019 on the industrial footprint of retail refrigeration for example, it would be squishy to the extent of there are some amount of redundant costs both in preparation for and working capital to prepare to make that transition. All right, but those are relatively known and easily measured right as opposed to having difficulty with the transition and not starting up appropriately where you're basically having difficulty executing on your backlog and then you get all of the frictional costs associated with that whether that is redundant labor significant overtime, freight expediting, paying supplier premiums, that part of it is execution and that's the part that while we may intervene on the industrial footprint, I think that the planning of that and our ability to demonstrate this is what it's going to cost and this is what the timeline, that part we'll fix. Scott Graham : All right. That's very helpful. And let me just be sort of a -- maybe a little bit more near-term-oriented here with my sort of second question. You laid it out very clearly that you're leaning fairly heavily on DFS for Q3 and retail refrigeration for Q4. And, I guess, I would say -- and I know that you don't want to go back to the past, but we've kind of done this. We're relying on this thing in the past. And I'm just wondering, do you have sort of plan Bs in those areas or in other areas to make sure that you stay within the guidance range? Richard Tobin : Well I mean we put the guidance out there and I can see that there's some pushback on the $4.85. So I think -- and I told -- what I said was the bias was to the upper end, right. So I think that we're trying to take into account all forecasts are associated with executing the business. Clearly, I think that the comp to comp in Q3 is going to be unexciting and it's going to be backend loaded, I don't see anything in Q4 that could swing the number significantly that wouldn't allow us to make it up, right. As I said it may be from a segmental point of view, it maybe puts and takes, I mentioned before we're ever reliant on Belvac shipments in Q4, if those get deferred into Q1, that's something that we're going to have to make up in DES or somewhere else. So we're again I\u2019m taking that into account in terms of the movement of the total portfolio. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session for the day. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : Thank you. This concludes our conference call. With that, we want to thank you for your continued interest in Dover and look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Have a good day, thanks. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today\u2019s second quarter 2018 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Paul Goldberg. Mr. Goldberg, please go ahead, sir. Paul Goldberg : Thank you, Laurie. Good morning and welcome to Dover's third quarter earnings call. Today's call will begin with comments from Rich and Brad on Dover's third quarter operating and financial performance and some comments on our 2018 outlook. We will then open the call up for questions. As a courtesy, we kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question with a follow-up. Dover is providing adjusted EPS results and EPS guidance that exclude after-tax acquisition-related amortization. We believe reporting adjusted EPS on this basis better reflects our core operating results, offers more transparency and facilitates easier comparability with peer companies. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures reflecting adjustments for aforementioned acquisition-related amortization, rightsizing and other costs are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials. Please note that our current earnings release, investor supplement and associated presentation can be found on our website dovercorporation.com. This call will be available for playback through November 08 and the audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for three months. The replay telephone number is (800) 585-8367. When accessing the playback, you'll need to supply the following access code 1598024. And before we get started today, I'd like to remind everyone that our comments today which are intended to supplement your understanding of Dover may contain certain forward-looking statements that are inherently subject to uncertainties. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any such forward-looking statement. We also undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. We would also direct your attention to our website where considerably more information can be found. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rich. Rich Tobin : Thank you, Paul. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us on this morning's conference call, let's get started on Slide 3. Organic revenue was up 3% for the quarter as solid demand trends in Engineered Systems and Fluids more than offset the continued weak demand environment in Refrigeration and Food Equipment. Adjusted Q3 earnings of $203 million and adjusted earnings per share were up 9% and 14% respectively. Bookings remained solid at $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter and are broad-based across the portfolio excluding Refrigeration. Overall the quarter was largely in line with our internal forecast and our earnings comments at the end of Q2. We expected a slower Q3 relative to the previous quarter in Engineered Systems as a result of demand colonization and scheduled production shutdowns at our European operations, despite this Engineered Systems margin conversion, our volume remained strong at 47%. Fluids performed as expected with solid results in Pumps and Process Solutions buffering the residual footprint costs in fueling and transport. Refrigeration & Food Equipment proved to be tougher than expected in the quarter and we've incorporated current conditions into our full-year guidance. Our fourth quarter stacking up to be driven by improved margin conversion in our Fluids segment as we get our operational issues behind us, coupled with the flow-through of our cost initiatives more than offsetting the negative impact of Refrigeration and Food Equipment business and the higher tax rate projected for the quarter. We have significantly completed our SG&A rightsizing plans during the quarter, which we will address in the presentation and that we're moving forward with our footprint rationalization activities, which we expect to begin executing in Q4. As a result of the above, we have further tightened the top end of the range of our EPS guidance to $4.80 to $4.85 per share. I'll pass it to Brad here and come back during the segment slides, Brad? Brad Cerepak : Thanks Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 4. As mentioned, our results were largely driven by solid demand in Engineered Systems and Fluids. Adjusted segment EBIT was essentially unchanged at $274 million and adjusted margin was 15.7%. This performance reflected strong conversion in engineered systems and improved performance in fluids, largely offset by lower volume in Refrigeration and Food Equipment. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $341 million. Adjusted earnings was $203 million and adjusted EPS was a $1.36. EPS benefited in the quarter from a lower tax rate on discrete tax benefits. The full-year effective rate is now expected to be between 20% and 21%. Moving on to Slide 5, let's get into a little bit more detail on our revenue and bookings results in the quarter. Third quarter revenue of $1.7 billion was comprised of 3% organic growth, offset by a 3% impact from dispositions net of acquisitions. FX was minimal in the quarter. Organic growth remained above 3% in Q3, despite headwinds in Refrigeration and Food Equipment. FX, which was a tailwind of 2.2% in Q2 decelerated into Q3, resulting in a small headwind of a 0.5%. We are using a US dollar-euro assumption of $1.17 in our current forecast. From a segment perspective, Engineered Systems grew $35 million organically and fluids grew $58 million on broad-based activity. Weak retail refrigeration markets and delayed shipments and can-shaping equipment drove a $39 million decline in Refrigeration and Food Equipments' revenue. Bookings increased 3% overall. Organic growth was 6%. Of note, Engineered Systems and Fluids' organic bookings grew $38 million and $77 million respectively, reflecting broad-based market demand. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market was flat organically where broad-based growth in Engineered Systems and Fluids was offset by Retail Refrigeration. Europe was up 2% organically and Asia grew 23%, largely driven by strong activity in our Fluid segment. Finally, book-to-bill finished at 0.98%. Let's take a look at the earnings bridges on Slide 6. Starting on the top, engineered adjusted segment EBITDA improved $8 million, largely driven by solid conversion on broad-based revenue growth. Fluids' EBITDA growth of $9 million reflects better execution in retail fueling and conversion on volume in our other businesses. The $23 million decline at Refrigeration and Food Equipment reflects lower volume and negative business mix. Going to the bottom of the chart; adjusted earnings improved $16 million or 9%, primarily driven by lower interest and corporate cost and a lower tax rate. Now on Slide 7; our nine-month free cash flow was $284 million or 66% of earnings from continuing operations. Third quarter free cash flow was $206 million, was on track with our expectations and largely in line with last year. We expect the fourth quarter to be our highest free cash flow quarter of the year, which is our normal pattern. Of note, the free cash flow impact of our restructuring initiatives on a year-to-date basis was $39 million of which $11 million was paid in Q3. In all, we expect to deliver full year cash flow within the range that we provided at our Investor Day in September. Moving to Slide 8; finally, we completed the open market portion of our 1 billion share repurchase program in the first week of October after repurchasing a 148 million in Q3. The 700 million ASR will be finalized by year-end thus completing the full program. With that, let me turn it back to Rich. Rich Tobin : Okay. Thanks Brad. Let's try to put some color around some of the segment performance in the quarter starting on Slide 10 with Engineered Systems. Engineered Systems had a solid broad-based quarter with seven out of eight operating companies posting improved revenue, driving a topline organic growth of 5%. Margin conversion in the quarter was excellent at 47% with all operating companies improving profitability quarter-over-quarter. Our printing and identification platform had solid performance in market by margin digital printing both of which posted topline growth greater than the average of the portfolio at accretive margins to the segment. Market modest growth is broad-based geographically with particular strength in consumables, which is positive to margins. Dover digital printing was driven by large equipment shipments and cost control initiatives, offsetting a competitive price environment. The industrial platform business is all increased comparative profits as our CapEx levered businesses continue to operate in a constructive demand environment. Our ESG business continued to deliver strong absolute profit results despite having a less rich product mix during the quarter and the continued pressure from higher raw material cost pass through. Our vehicle service group delivered its strong margins margin performance of the year despite its European facilities beings down for scheduled maintenance in the quarter. OKI, DESTACO and TWG continued to benefit from end market CapEx-driven demand and dealer stocking and microwave products continued to perform in what we believe to be a multiyear constructive environment for military spending. Going into Q4, bookings for Engineered Systems remained solid. We expect the quarter to be a good one, despite some comparable negative product mix in ESG and microwave products and FX headwinds in our businesses that are material exposed to Europe predominantly, Markem-Imaje, digital printing and ESG. Next slide. The Fluid segment posted organic growth of 9% for the quarter with the majority of the portfolio posting comparative topline growth with particular strength in our fueling and transport businesses. Consolidated margin for the segment was flat largely as a result of the dilutive impact of fueling systems to segment margin and some transitory footprint issues in our transport business, which should be largely contained in Q3. Our pumps and process solutions businesses all performed well during the quarter. Incremental margin performance in PSG, MAG and Precision Components were all in excess of 50% in the period, as a result of volume leverage, mix pricing and cost control initiatives, outweighing input cost headwinds and tariff costs on imported components. Colder continued to perform well in the period in both the top and bottom lines as a result of solid demand in single-use connectors. Fueling and transport had a choppy quarter from a margin conversion point of view, but we are encouraging in our exit margin for the quarter and our forecast for topline and margin conversion leading into Q4. In Q3, DFS posted solid topline growth and while incremental margin performance was still below expectations, it was improved and leaves us to be confident that the majority of our footprint consolidation costs are behind us and that we are headed in the right direction in meeting our margin objectives as we outlined in our September presentation. In OPW, while our margin performance was satisfactory, we did have prior period footprint-related costs in the quarter and lost production time at our North Carolina facility as a result of weather-related issues. Our Q4 forecast for Dover is largely driven by the expected improvement, margin conversion in the Fluid segment, particularly driven by our fueling and transport businesses, improving their operational performance and the beginning flow-through of our cost control initiatives. I've just returned from our facility in Dundee, Scotland, while there remains much to do, I am confident that our line rates are set to improve through the quarter and will benefit from the industrial absorption and reduction in frictional costs. Of note, we are assessing the outlook for EMV demand in the U.S. in 2019 and we'll be making some decisions as to the appropriate level of component stock to be carried into January to support projected demand. Moving on the Refrigeration and Food Equipment had its toughest quarter of the year and Q3 with segment revenue down 12% to $386 million. While we have been expecting another difficult quarter in retail refrigeration, we are caught off guard in our Belvac business, where machine deliveries have increasingly deferred into 2019, negatively impacting our prior forecast for segment margin for the quarter and full year. Our full-year segment forecast now incorporates a more modest decline in demand and Retail Refrigeration as this business begins to bottom and a push out of machine deliveries from Belvac into 2019, which are as significantly accretive to margins in the segment. This negative mix impact will be partially offset by cost control actions undertaken in the year, largely in the Retail Refrigeration business. This earnings miss in Belvac does not add an additional operational challenge to the Group, nor does it change the fundamental value of the business in the portfolio as it is unique asset, capable of delivering high, but inherently lumpy returns. As we presented in September, we've begun in earnest to address our footprint actions in the segment as it is the clearest path to improving margins to the target ranges that we established in the presentation. We expect to begin in Q4 and continue the project through 2019. Let's go on to the next slide, as we noted in the morning's press release, we are progressing as planned in the rightsizing initiative that we announced at our Investor meeting in September. As you see in the slide, we are well on our way to concluding the reduction in force portion of the plan and you can see the reconciliation of the PLL impact for both the restructuring charge and the SG&A cost reduction in Q3 and the projection of the timing of the charges for the balance of the plan. The non-headcount portion of the plan will be almost exclusively weighted towards 2019 and I think that Brad addressed converting these charges into cash, we can deal with the Q4 charges and what do we project on that cash impact in the Q&A. Moving on to the next slide is the guidance, which I addressed in the press release in my comments on the segment outlooks to conclude. We enter Q4 with good order backlog to cost much of the portfolio, which has weathered the challenges of higher input costs in an uncertain global trade environment during the year. Clearly there remains much to do to deliver on our full year guidance, but by acting decisively our cost structure, we are in a good position to deliver. I've been encouraged by the engagement of our leaders to embrace these changes and I'm looking forward to embarking on the next stage of our initiatives and our objective of delivering best-in-class operating performance. That's it. Let's move on to Q&A. Paul Goldberg : Thanks Rich. Laurie, before we have our first question, I just like to remind everybody, if you can limit yourself to one question with a follow-up, that will be able to get more people in the queue. Let's have our first question. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, guys. Rich Tobin : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Rich, at the Analyst Day in September, you mentioned you're starting to see some stability in pricing within Refrigeration. You kind of did talk about in the presentation today, you'd also mentioned some interesting new products coming out. Obviously, you have the Belvac delays there, but margin was lower than most of us thought. So can you -- is it too early still to call it bottom there and can you keep up with the cost there? Can you use cost pick up to keep up with the volume declines as we go into 2019? Rich Tobin : Okay. Well, I think that we need to bifurcate the answer between the headwind on Belvac that is really going to move into 2019. That's going to cost us about $10 million in comparable profits to Q4 last year. We're not where as I mentioned, I am not worried about the business overall. The backlog is there. It's just that these are pretty lumpy revenue and returns and the margin on the Belvac volume is quite high. So we're going to have to make up that particular headwind on that basis from that with cost control actions of the aggregate of the cost control actions. On Retail Refrigeration, we haven't really seen a positive pricing environment, but I think that early data shows that some of the negative pricing pressure that we saw in the first half of year has begun to moderate. I don't think we're prepared to call the bottom, but at least from what we can see in backlog is going into Q4 clearly the market started slowing down at the end of last year. So the comp gets better, but the rate of decline in terms of the backlog is significantly smaller than we've been seeing all year. So I don't think we are prepared right now to say we're at the bottom, but I think the data would show that the decline has come down quite a bit and that the pricing headwinds have moderated some. We're going to really move from our decision-making process going into next year is really going to be to call the size of the market and that's what's going to drive the cost takeout from a footprint point of view, but that's really a full-year project that can take us to do it. So I'm -- look, I just don't think it's getting that much worse going into '19, but I don't have any indicators that say it's going to be better in '19 other than the fact that I think that we will benefit from the -- through the year cost takeout when we start doing the comps going into 2019. Andrew Kaplowitz : Great and then Rich, maybe can you give us some more color into revenue growth across the company. Obviously, you talked by geography, U.S. is flat. We know it's Refrigeration sort of holding that down. Asia 0.3%, obviously there is a lot of concern out there on the macro side into China and Asia, but didn't seem like you guys are seeing it. So maybe talk about the visibility you have in two of the geographic growth as you go Q4 and into 2019? Rich Tobin : Look clearly the North American market is the leader in terms of the demand, but in our exposure to Asia overall, is relative -- it's not overly material, but right now are the demand that we've seen particular in China is kept up. A lot of that is in the underground portion or the OPW portion of the business right now. North America I think it's a couple different tales at the end of the day. I think the CapEx levered businesses that we have are posting good topline growth. I think if you go through some of the -- some of the comments that I wrote in the press release about who's clocking double-digit growth, we can go through it again, but our fueling systems is close to 15 for the quarter. So that begs the question of what going to have to happen to EMV. So I'll leave that to a follow-on question. But overall, GDP in North America is up and it's driving the CapEx end of our businesses. I think the Markem-Imaje is just performing in the sector. So it's growth was close to 5% for the quarter. So it's clocking quite well and that as I mentioned in the margin conversion in those business has been excellent. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks. That's good color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Winoker of UBS. Steve Winoker : Thanks and good morning all. Hi, just a couple questions; one, not just because you cheated off. So what was the EMV growth in the quarter? What are you seeing in terms of trajectory there and how are you thinking about that going forward? Rich Tobin : I won't put it in percentage terms, but EMV grew during the quarter approximately 5%. The expectation that that same rate will continue into Q4, I think that our view is US demand, EMV-driven demand however we want to describe that between [indiscernible] and full units is going to be up next year. I just don't think we're prepared to put a quantum on it yet, but clearly it's going to be in our 2019 guidance. So it's coming, the decisions that we're trying to make is how much inventory delay in as I said in my comments, how much inventory delay in to be prepared if we get a big flex at the beginning of 2019. Steve Winoker : Okay. Good to hear. And then I just want to follow up at Belvac commentary as well, simply because if we go back and listen to their comments from last quarter, at that time it was pushed and the thought was look it's backend loaded to Q4. The expectation was that it will remain. So specifically, it's always easy for a lot of companies as they project push out for large projects. Can you give us a little more comfort level that of what's going on here and why it's sort of just one more quarter and we can then put in our own numbers for Q1. Rich Tobin : Yeah, look I think that we're pretty transparent. We're caught off guard bias right. We had the backlog and we're moving into beginning the source and we did source some of the raw [ph] to actually get into building out some pretty large units. The deliveries have been deferred. Now what does that mean for 2019 is an additive. I think it's too early to say, but I think that what we believe is what we had in the pipe. We're going to deliver in 2019, but I mean, look these are very big machines. So they had big ticket prices on them and they have very high margins on is pissed off as everybody that the fact that they got, but I don't believe that it's something that's changed in terms of the market structure that you know what I mean, that some reason that the retail what would it be called, retail food for beverage is rolling over by a stretch imagination and our customers there are a lot of times retail beverage. There's some of the canning makers themselves. So I don't think it's overly worrisome. I just think that the timing of it is poor and the fact that it happened in a sector that we've already had headwinds in is it makes it doubly poor, but I think it's still a good business and I would expect that, that we'll deliver on that volume that we should have been in 2019. Brad Cerepak : I would just add to your comment earlier, we'll just have more to say about this in January '19, but I would not at this stage think that it's an automatic ship in the first quarter. We'll come back on the timing of that, which is expected to be slightly later than that or later than that. Steve Winoker : Okay. All right. That's all really helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning all. Rich Tobin : Good morning. Jeffrey Sprague : Rich, want to think a little bit more about the puts and takes in a little more detail, the Belvac color is really helpful. If we think about I guess you got roughly $24 million of restructuring tailwinds in the numbers here in 2018. Should we think kind of the most of the kind of missing upside for lack of a better term is just price cost. Can you give us a little color on price cost in the quarter and what you're dealing with there and any kind of pricing counteraction that you're taking? Rich Tobin : I think as I mentioned in my comments, I think that both the Engineering Systems Group and Fluids Group performed as we expected. I think at the end of Q2, I made some comments that if you looked at the trajectory of earnings in Engineering Systems that you couldn't just clock that through the balance of the year because of the fact that we knew that Q3 is going to be a little bit light to that trajectory. Now having said that, the incremental margin on that revenue is still significant. So it's not by any means a bad performance. It's just that we expected that to happen to a certain extent. On Fluids, I think the growth rate is still very good, but it's a little bit of the same story that we've had year-to-date in terms of the margin conversion on the DFS portion of the business. It actually exited quite well in the month of September and that's why in our full-year forecast, a lot of our operating performance, at least our comparable operating performance year-over-year is can be driven by Fluids. Jeffrey Sprague : And think I was also curious. I think you said the footprint restructuring is now actually done in fueling. I was thinking that was more of a 2019 exercise. Is that correct? Rich Tobin : No, no. What I was saying is that we've been carrying around the cost of the Dundee consolidation. The Europe, the first piece of the European footprint, which never went into restructuring. We've been taken that through the P&L all year. That is largely complete. So that's where I was last week. Look, we're getting into the gory details. Line rates are picking up, the absorption is picking up and without getting into monthly margins, I look at our September margins in DFS. They\u2019ve moved up significantly. So it leads us to feel good about the fact that that's where we have a lot of demand going into Q4, if we can convert September margins, we're in pretty good shape. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And thanks for the concise nature of the preparatory remarks. My first question I guess is on the free cash flow. I saw the detail on restructuring and so forth, but working capital has been a big drain in the first nine months, $160 million or so of the cash out. So I just wondered how quickly we should expect that to reverse and whether one should expect a much better performance on that next year? Rich Tobin : Well, I think that Brad said in his comments that we expect to be within the range that we gave as a percent of revenue in the September presentation. It's going to clearly going to take some heavy lifting to get there, but we think we are confident we can get inside the range. And in terms of 2019 performance, well, if I take out the restructuring, the cash impact on the restructuring, that's going to depend on our guidance for topline revenue right. So again we are building net working capital, which is pretty much inventory receivables on the back of topline growth. Refrigeration is just not large enough to offset that. So our liquidating inventory on refrigeration side because revenue is coming down but conversely we've been building inventory on some pretty good growth rates on the balance of our business. We are not clocking at best-in-class cash flow clearly. So there's a lot of work to be done, but before we start giving '19, I think that I'll put it this way. In '19, we'll be through in the range that we gave in September. How that dynamic functions is going to be a question of once we call growth rates for 2019. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then just circling back to maybe one more time to RFE, are we right in thinking that this year, the adjusted profit is sort of about $150 million for that business and then yeah if you do or don't want to get caught around that may be related to it, how quickly you think we start to see footprint consolidation savings next year in that business? Rich Tobin : Let's not -- look, I won't answer the question about the segmental margin expectation, other than the fact I did give you some color on the quarter-to-quarter. It's going to be $10 million negative impact because of Belvac year-over-year. So that something that we are going to have to make up. The footprint optimization will begin in Q4. It's not to be overly material. I think that the bigger in terms of its positive impact in 2019 but we will give you the color around that when we make the formal announcement. I think that the bigger positive is going to be the fact that we've taken out a significant amount of overhead out of that business through the year right. So we've been rightsizing as we've gone down. We have flat revenue and we'll get the benefit of the full-year benefits taking that out. The larger footprint issues are going to take throughout 2019, because there is a pretty large endeavors in terms of -- in terms of lot of automation and then dealing with the actual physical footprint. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes. Good morning. I just have a simple question given that you sort of started our cost cutting in Q3 and Q4 back on September 11, you said $0.53 of net benefit in 2019. Can we assume that everything you have done so far is consistent with that framework? Rich Tobin : Yes. Andrew Obin : So still -- so those numbers still stand. And then the second question on sort of timing of restructuring in Refrigeration Food Equipment and also you talked about footprint. Looking at the queue, there was just not a lot of restructuring in the business and I understand that Belvac was part of it, but should we think that this restructuring is sort the timing here is related to the sort of the timing of footprint rationalization as well. Is that the way to think, just thinking about the timing of what's going on in that segment? Rich Tobin : Yes and no, is the answer to that question. If you go back and look at the presentation in September, there wasn\u2019t a lot of restructuring in that particular segment because management had been taking out costs all year as the revenue had gone down. So there was not a lot of low hanging fruit per se. There is some restructuring the comes along with the footprint actions, but there is isn\u2019t any kind of residual structuring that we're just waiting on timing in terms refrigeration. It's overly material. Andrew Obin : Fantastic. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning. Rich Tobin : Good morning. Deane Dray : Hey, I would like to go, Rich to your comment on seeing competition in inks in Markem-Imaje and I don't think I've heard this before because you do make your own inks and the whole kind of proprietary nature of your inks you could only use your inks with your equipment. So how has come competition in inks cropped up into this business? Rich Tobin : Well, I should have been more specific. So I apologize. That was a comment about our JK Business that is part of digital printing. It was not a comment. I think the comment I made about Markem-Imaje is performance and its incremental margin was because it was driven by consumables, which is largely ink at the end of the day. So no issues in terms of that side of the business. The competition on inks is more on the -- on the digital print side. Deane Dray : Okay That's really good to hear. All right. Thank you for that,. And then maybe just a broad question about the footprint reductions that you're facing and a lot of questions about like in retail fueling you're cutting back on inventory, what about the other side to this? Are you going to step up and build some buffer inventory to avoid some disruptions as you go through these footprint reductions? Rich Tobin : That's two different questions. Number one, we're actually carrying more inventory than we would like in retail fueling. Some of that is based on the fact that the topline growth has been robust, but it's very much impacted by some of this footprint consolidation work that started last year in supply chain, right. So this whole closing of Malmo and moving to Dundee, you're basically transferring a significant amount of working capital it takes longer to grind through the systems. So we're not -- we're actually not happy about our performance right now. It's understandable but we're not pleased with it. The comment I made about inventory in DFS is it's a question of how much can we clear out operationally. We've got a good backlog. So we should be able to perform in Q4 and consume a lot of that kind of operational inventory, but we really need to make a decision about EMV for 2019 and we don't want to get caught off-guard. I don't want to be sitting here at the end of Q1 saying that we've got -- we've got frictional costs for expediting in air shipments because we didn't have enough kits in place to support the demand of EMV Right now we're not entirely sure what the pace of the start off in EMV is going to be in 2019, but I'm reasonably sure there we're going to be prudent and make sure that we carry some inventory into '19 that we can support whatever demand is there. Deane Dray : How about the buffer inventory, just as a safety practice as you embark on these footprint reductions? Rich Tobin : Yeah I think when we when we do a material one, I think that would be part of the disclosure. Deane Dray : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. Rich Tobin : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : So just to clarify the free cash flow commentary a little bit, you said you're going to be within the range, but it's a little bit of a TBD. Should we just assume kind of the low-end of the range I guess is what you're saying kind of the 8% range for this year? Brad Cerepak : I think you can assume that it will be in the range Steve. I can't get down to the level of granularity to say it's going to be 8.75%. Steve Tusa : Okay. And just to be clear, the $40 million of restructuring at about 50 Bps of that headwind? Brad Cerepak : In terms of the cash flow headwind. Steve Tusa : Yeah, just a headwind on the cash margin. Brad Cerepak : I haven't made that calculation. I think that we can expect out of the fourth quarter restructuring charge, approximately I'd say 50% of that charge would be cash and the balance of it would probably slow. Rich Tobin : We also have some carry over. So I think the full year cash flow impact including Q4 is about $59 million, $60 million of cash. It's little bit higher than 50 Bps if you want to do the math. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then one quick, just follow up on PID, you are doing I think some restructuring in PID, I would assume or is any of that restructuring related to you know kind of sales or stand or service? Rich Tobin : No. It's far more back office and you saw from our press release the other day about it's about as open our digital center part of that has to do with the fact that of the transfer of some assets between Keane and Boston. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Good morning, everyone. So the queue called out week refrigerated door case sales and it kind of implies there is a remodeling aspect to this, which I think you might have even cited somewhere in the queue. Is that a new phase of segment weakness? It may not have as much impact because of it's just not as big as the other but I am just trying to dovetail that with Rich your commentary around sort of the pricing dynamic seems to be improving and getting closer to a bottoming. Rich Tobin : Okay. Well no nothing's really changed. The build-out -- so the Greenfield build-out of new construction has been weak, what we did not expect at the beginning of the year and we've been kind of been writing it down on a year is that a lot of maintenance cap or refurbishment CapEx has been deferred or is not done in '19. So dynamic is the same, but the rate of the decline has moderated at the end of Q3 going into Q4. So it's really nothing there. John Inch : Getting that maintenance get caught back? What kind of deferrals -- that's why I'm asking this question about the context of maintenance and sort of whereas we are at in the industry cycle? Is this somehow would have been normal to expect or is it something that's new. It may not be that impactful, but it's still new suggesting industry troubles are going to go on for a while? Rich Tobin : Hard to say right now. My best guess is we're bottoming right now. So worst case scenario it's flat in '19 better case scenario, the maintenance portion of the spend starts to move back up. John Inch : 50% almost 50% variable contribution margins in ES, is there a mix angle that's driving such a big off-profit improvement in that segment to drive the margins? What's sort of behind the number to cause for that result? Rich Tobin : It's a combination of good mix and good operational performance. I think that we've got certain businesses that have done well, pricing in excess of input cost headwinds are CapEx levered businesses, some of them are highly engineered products and those -- and as such, the margins on that volume are very good. John Inch : Just one last one -- as you've gone through this third quarter into fourth quarter restructuring, is some company that they go through these restructuring programs, the more they cut, the more they realize, they can't cut and I'm just curious where we are today versus your expectations when you started? Are you seeing as much more -- what's sort of the feedback as you think about the opportunities that maybe the opportunity set to go after maybe even some more overhead cost out that you had previously talked about? Rich Tobin : I think it's a little bit too early to talk about more overhead cost. What I can tell you is that I'm proud of the management team here embracing the challenge to take the cost out because it's just not easy, but I think that there's a belief that we have a plan in place that allows us to take these costs out while reinvesting in those platforms to make the businesses stronger. John Inch : Thanks very much. Rich Tobin : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Rich Tobin : Hi Joe. Joe Ritchie : So Rich, it look like pricing got a lot better this quarter than it has been the previous two quarters, just maybe talk a little bit about how much of that is tariff-related versus to pricing that you're getting and like how should we be thinking about that number moving forward over the next couple quarters? Rich Tobin : It's not materially better pricing, I think it's much more weighted towards mix and price overall. I think that by and large I think that we've done reasonably well in terms of price. Some operations better than others based on kind of the backlog and uniqueness of the product, but there is not a lot of price. I think that there is you see volume leverage coming through and you see better mix coming through, more than price. I mean there is a little element of price, but net of all cost headwinds, it's a relatively immaterial number. Joe Ritchie : Okay. All right. It just seemed like it had gotten a little bit better just based on the queue, but that's okay. Maybe just following through on like the Belvac discussion, so recognize that Belvac surprised you guys, I'm just curious like what are your customers saying? Are the deferrals related to tariff-related concerns? I am just curious if there's any additional color there? Rich Tobin : Yeah it ends up being a dogs breakfast. There is a variety of different reasons, they are all rational. They are timing in terms of all build-outs of their own footprints. I think that there is an element of kind of macro that's embedded there to a certain extent. It's been -- some of the -- a lot of this volume is international volume and you've got a variety of noise out in the system, which I think is making people little bit more deliberate in terms of their own CapEx plans. I think that the projects are intact overall, but I think some of it has caught up in that kind of general macro noise. Joe Ritchie : Got it. And if I can maybe just quickly clarify Andrew's comments from earlier, with the restructuring benefits that you have coming through from the rightsizing this year, so I call it roughly $24 million, the investment right now it all going to happen in 2019 right. So the incremental benefit should be around $0.39, is that right? Rich Tobin : Well, I said it was a gross of 130 right and out of the 130 that's round here, 25 gets picked up in 2018 right. So it's a rolling -- it's a rolling 12 on 130. So we're tracking right along. I said about that '19 is if you go back and look at the presentation, a percentage of it is headcount related, that's the part that we're substantially complete. The balance of it is the consumption of SG&A by that headcount to a certain extent is the kind of broad-based say that you get in '19 right. So the full effect of that portion is in '19. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Just to go back to your previous comment Rich about the pricing. At the queue it calls out 1.1% pricing which is pretty decent. It's certainly a lot better than last quarter. Is that a price mix number or is that pure price? Rich Tobin : Yeah it's a price, it's a pure price right, but it's a pure price net of input. Nigel Coe : Okay. I'll pull off, but 1.1% is not bad. Rich Tobin : That's for the earnings thing. That's pure price. That's not mix. On the revenue side, it's pure price on the EBIT side, it's a net number. Brad Cerepak : As we said, it's slightly better than what we expected going into the third quarter. Material costs are up slightly too. So the net, net is it puts us in the same position we were before. That's the way I think about it? Nigel Coe : So my question was really, is that 1.1%, is that fully loaded? Was it some price increases that came through during the quarter that makes 4Q better than the 1.1% or is that a good run rate from here? Rich Tobin : No, I think that's a good run rate because our businesses have been added for a while and we're seeing good momentum in certain of the businesses, which have a higher input cost and I feel like it's pretty stable going into the fourth quarter? Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. And then Rich, you made small comments, which I thought was interesting. You mentioned that you saw some dealer stocking, I think that was in the sector, but did you see broader dealer stocking during the quarter? And then you mentioned I think the weakening in Europe going into 4Q. Did I just pick up those right? Rich Tobin : Sure. Well, look we've got businesses that are in certain cases 80% of the revenue goes through distribution. So you can't really see the retail customer. So our revenues are two dealers at the end of the day. So a dealer stocking is not necessarily a bad thing because of the fact our dealers only stock based on their projection of demand. So overall we're talking about some of the smaller businesses like TWG and OKI, I wouldn't be worried about kind of the that we're kind of pushing into dealers and that we're going to have to pay the price for that. I think it's more of a positive comment of some of our businesses that sell through distribution. Our network is positive and they're trying to get their hands on what we make. Nigel Coe : Great thanks. Rich Tobin : Yeah and then the second part of it was more of an FX-related comment right. So quarter-over-quarter, there is a headwind on the euro. I think Brad kind of cleared, he went through the trajectory of it and based on I think we use a $19.01 -- $19.07, so there is a headwind at least in the way that we're forecasting on our European levered businesses, which is largely more revenue a revenue issue than anything else. Nigel Coe : All right. Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mircea Dobre of Baird. Mircea Dobre : Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just looking at your Slide 13, the rightsizing update, I realize this is a little nitpicking but your mix of gross savings has changed a little bit. Can you maybe give us some color as to what's driving assuming a segment level? Rich Tobin : Yeah, I don't think it's a change at the segment level. I think if you notice on the cost side, there's a little bit of cost now associated with corporate, well that's driving a little bit of the benefit side as well. So it's just a minor change. Mircea Dobre : Okay. And then just making sure that I understand this correctly, back to any -- so if we're looking at '18 and I was what carries into '19, you're essentially saying that you got $10 million Belvac contribution to operating income that switches into '19 and you've got the savings from the rightsizing here that you\u2019ve detailed on this slide that's another what call it an 10 incremental. So that takes us to 20. Is there something else that we should be aware of in terms of specific drag that you had in '18 that will no longer be there in '19 or anything else that kind of helps us make that bridge? Rich Tobin : I think that's enough for now. Mircea Dobre : All right. Rich Tobin : I mean we'll do it when we close the year and we give the kind of the guidance overall, we'll give you the color of what we think about '19, but right now you\u2019ve got your fingers on the two pieces right. It's in the cost takeout in '18 and the Belvac mix that you can kind of roll forward. Mircea Dobre : Well, then maybe you'll humor me with one more, that you mentioned this impact from Section 301 tariffs on fluids. I'm wondering can you detail what the magnitude has been and what the drag would be going forward? Rich Tobin : You know what, I've got a big spreadsheet in front of me. I can tell you right now that we're covering it through productivity and price. So I don't believe it's a drag. If it's specifically about RF&E, I'm not aware of any material exposure to imported components in that particular segment. Brad Cerepak : On 301 yeah. Certainly on 232, which we've talked about before, but again we'll have to see how that progresses into '19. but at this stage Rich is correct, it's not a big number on 301 for us. We don't ship a lot of product out of China into the U.S. and at this stage it's been covered to productivity. Mircea Dobre : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Nathan Jones : Good morning, everyone. I've got one more on the Belvac push-out, I think Brad said don't expect that to ship in the first quarter. So these shipments have now been pushed out probably close to a year. Do you have contractual protections against cancellations in this? How do you feel about the potential for those orders to not shift to the right actually go away and what gives you confidence that, that won't happen? Brad Cerepak : There is an amount of progress building and once we start the engineering and the procurement phase, so I don't expect a double negative on an additional push out and look and crystallizing that backlog into orders as I think that Brad was right to say, look we believe that it's going to roll into '19, but let's be careful. It's not as of January 01. We're going to kick it off and we would expect a big comparable bump on the segment in the first quarter because of that translation right. We believe we will get it during the year. It's unclear right now when we kick it off. Nathan Jones : Okay. Thanks. My second question is on pump and process business. I think during your comments you said that that part of the business realized incremental above 50%, demand there has been pretty good for a while. Can you talk about what's driving those high incrementals in terms of improved pricing in the market versus your internal initiatives that kind of thing? Brad Cerepak : I think that answers -- ends up being incredibly granular. I think that overall it's a combination of volume leverage because the revenue has been moving up in the segment, having a direct impact. I think that the fact that they've got in front of their input cost headwinds that they're either positive or net neutral has an impact and then demand is there. So then just pure volume, that's not kind of absorption, not the absorption impact of it. So it's a combination of all those. In certain businesses and then you\u2019ve got companies like Precision Components that the nature of that business when it's up, its highly engineered product. So the margins on some of those products is very good and we've got particular strength as I mentioned at the end of Q2 in our high drawer colder business that we're expanding the footprint of that business because demand has been great and the margins are very accretive to the segment. Nathan Jones : Thanks very much. Operator : Your final question will come from the line of Charley Brady of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Charley Brady : Just a quick one for me to finish it here. Your comment back at the Analyst rate of 15% to 17%, I just want to go back to your earlier comments on how that's performing and without getting too granular, it sounds like it's maybe getting a little bit better, faster than you had originally anticipated. Rich Tobin : I think it's not better and faster. I think there we're just happy right. We've been bragging that around for the full year. I think the team has worked really hard in a pretty bad situation, that we had in terms of that consolidation in Europe, but they\u2019ve ground through it and we see ourselves coming out on the other side. So we don't have a lot of negative. It wasn't just the consolidation in Europe. It's when you can't get the throughput out of that facility, you're making it up and other facilities, which has got supplier premiums and air freight. So there's a lot of kind of additional frictional costs in the system. That's all coming out because I think that Dundee's has got the feet on the ground now and you couple that with the demand of EMV coming up and EMV products if you will are beneficial to margins of the Group. So we like what we saw of our exit margins in Q1 and that leads us in some amount of confidence and going into Q4 meeting our objectives because from a year-over-year basis what we are looking for is a lot of the year-over-year profit change is going to come out of that particular segment. Charley Brady : Just one more on OPW, you commented there is a weather impact obviously. Can you quantify if that's material on you lost few days on the margin perspective, and now working back, can you quantify that? Rich Tobin : I don't have the number in front of me. It's not overly material. I think the bigger issue that OPW had, just at a quarter-to-quarter basis was some footprint consolidation cost that they had started before kind of we announced this new initiative right. This is something that's been going on all year. They finished it up and then they took some charges in the quarter, which weren't helpful, but I think like I said it's largely contained in the Q3. So our expectation is that OPW's margins in Q4 are going to be good. Charley Brady : Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. That's concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Goldberg for closing remarks. Paul Goldberg : Yeah. Thanks very much for joining us for the Q3 earnings call. We look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's third quarter 2018 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

Richard Tobin : Thanks, Andrey, and good morning everyone from balmy Chicago. Let's gets started on Slide 3. Q4 again organic revenue growth was up 6.2% for the quarter and solid demand trends and engineering systems and at exceptionally strong performance in our fluid segment more than offset the continued weak demand environment in Refrigeration & Food Equipment particularly and can making equipment in Food Retail. Thus adjusted Q4 earnings were up 17% driven by top line growth, volume leverage and cost actions initiated in Q3. Adjusted EPS had $1.43 per share was up 25% inclusive of $0.08 of favorable impact from tax. As we discussed at the end of Q3, we had some heavy lifting to do to offset the Q4 forecast for trading environment in Refrigeration & Food Equipment. The organization made a determined effort to convert its backlogs crystallizes its cost-saving targets, and focus on cash conversion with good effect. Despite the excellent shipping performance through Q4 and many of our businesses bookings remained solid at the end of the quarter, posting a book-to-bill ratio above one, which were broad-based across the portfolio. Our SG&A rightsizing initiative is largely complete and during the quarter we began the first projects of our footprint rationalization plan, particularly with the three to one production sites rationalization in Unified Brands, which is underway. In Q4, we have taken our initial restructuring charge of $5 million as a result of the announced footprint consolidation efforts, which we forecast to deliver $4 million into 2019 an annualized run rate savings of $18 million. Finally, on the inorganic growth front, last Friday, we completed the acquisition of Belanger, a leading car wash equipment manufacturer, which we announced earlier in the month. Belanger meets all of the criteria for inorganic investment in terms of market attractiveness, execution profile and return on invested capital that we laid out at our analyst day in September. It's been a busy quarter for the Company, I\u2019m pleased that were able to deliver solid top line growth and generate significant cash flow from operations while concurrently delivering on our productivity initiatives now since September. So that\u2019s the balance of the opening comments. From here, I will pass it on to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s go through the details starting on Slide 4. As mentioned, our results for the quarter were driven by strong demand in Engineered Systems and Fluids, solid margin conversion on revenue growth and cost actions. Adjusted segment EBIT increased 9% to 285 million and adjusted margin was 15.7%, an increase of 80 basis points. This performance reflected strong growth in conversion in Engineered Systems and improved performance in Fluids, partially offset by lower volume in Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Adjusted segment EBITDA was 352 million. Adjusted earnings were 211 million in the quarter and adjusted diluted EPS was a $43, an increase of 25% over last year. The EPS increase was supported by share repurchases and a lower tax rate. Full year 2018 results followed the same narrative as the fourth quarter. Results were largely driven by strong growth across our Engineered Systems and Fluids segments partially offset by lower volume within our Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. Adjusted full year 2018 segment EBIT increased 4% to just over 1 billion. Adjusted EBIT margin was 14.8%, an increase of 30 basis points driven by stronger conversion on revenue growth and by the impact of our margin improvement plan. The effective tax rate for the full year was 21.4% when normalized for discrete tax benefits, excluding the additional Tax Act regulatory guidance covered by SAB 118. Now turning to Slide 5. Let\u2019s get into a little bit more detail on revenue and bookings results in the quarter. Fourth quarter revenue grew by 3.2% to 1.8 billion. Organic growth in the quarter was 6.2% despite headwinds in Refrigeration & Food Equipment. The impact from FX and dispositions added headwinds of about 2% and 1% respectively. From a segment perspective, Engineered Systems grew 30 million or 4.3% organically and Fluids grew a 118 million or 17.2% organically on broad-based activity across the segments. Delayed shipments and can-shaping equipment and weak retail refrigeration markets drove a 39 million or 10.2% organic decline in Refrigeration & Food Equipments revenue. The majority of which is due the expected year-over-year declines at Belvac. In the fourth quarter, our retail refrigeration business posted its lowest rate of revenue decline in 2018 at approximately 3%. Bookings increased 8% overall. Organic growth was strong at 10% contributing to an increase in backlog both over the third quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017. Of note Engineered Systems and Fluids organic bookings grew 86 million and 54 million respectively reflecting broad-based market demand. Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments bookings grew 25 million organically and approved orders at retail refrigeration and exceeded revenue by 14 million in the quarter. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. our largest market grew 6% organically where broad-based growth in Engineered Systems and Fluids was partially offset by retail refrigeration, which is primarily a domestic business. Europe was up 10% organically with strong performance across all segments and Asia was flat. Within Asia, China grew 6% organically driven by strong growth in our food and segment. Finally book-to-bill finished at 1.02, reflecting strong orders across our segments including Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Let's go to the earnings bridge now on Slide 6. Starting on the top, Engineered Systems adjusted segment EBITDA improved 11 million, largely driven by solid conversion on broad-based revenue growth across the segments, more than offsetting headwinds from FX and dispositions. Fluids EBITDA growth of 32 million reflects a combination of robust growth better execution in retail fueling as well as strong conversion on volume in other businesses. The 22 million decline in refrigeration Food Equipment reflects lower volume and negative business mix particularly in our can making and retail refrigeration businesses. Additionally, our margin improvement plan began to deliver results with our SG&A initiative contributing 22 million of savings to Q4 results. Going to the bottom of the chart, adjusted earnings from continuing operations improved 31 million or 17%, primarily driven by higher segment earnings, lower interest and corporate costs, partially offset by higher taxes and increased earnings. Now on Slide 7, free cash flow for the quarter was seasonally strong posting our highest quarterly cash flow for the year despite the strong revenue impact resulting in higher year-end receivables. The fourth quarter is traditionally our highest cash flow quarter. Free cash flow for the year was 618 million or 8.8% of revenue within our guidance from our analyst day in September. Cash cost of 52 million associated with our restructuring initiatives negatively impacted cash flow in the year, excluding such non-recurring cash outlays, free cash flow was 9.6% of revenue Now let me turn back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks Brad. Let\u2019s go on to Slide 9, Engineered Systems had a solid broad-based quarter top line organic growth of 4.3%. Incremental margin conversion in the quarter was excellent, driven by favorable mix and cost actions largely in the printing and IT platform despite a more modest top line growth rate in Q4. The industrial platform perform well across the board as our CapEx levered businesses continue to operate in a constructive demand environment and all posting top line comparable revenue increases. Our ESG business continued to deliver strong results with a robust positive bookings trend building a runway to a solid forecasted performance for 2019. OKI, DESTACO and TWG all finish the year contributing solid single digit growth and margin expansion and microwave products delivered as expected in a robust military spending environment. Going into 2019 bookings for engineering systems remained solid. We expect the segment to contribute positively to both the top and bottom line despite the forecast is FX headwinds in our businesses that are material exposed to Europe predominantly marking margin digital printing and ESG. The Fluid segment posted organic grommets growth of 17% for the quarter with the majority of the portfolio posting double-digit comparable growth rates. Incremental was margin was solid for the quarter as volume leverage and cost controls were able to offset the impact of favorable product and geographic mix. Our pumps and process solutions businesses had an excellent quarter with incremental margin performance in MAG, Hydro and Precision Components in excess of 35% in the period as a result of volume leverage, mix pricing and cost control initiatives, outweighing input cost headwinds and tariff costs on imported components. Fueling and transport posted exceptional top line performance for the quarter, as demand remained robust and were able to clear the backlog that's been built a result of our facility consolidations and DFS and OPW. Margin conversion while improving sequentially is the largest opportunity performance improvement going into 2019, and we are targeting to progressively track to the margin objectives that we laid out in September through the year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment revenue decline in the fourth quarter with the segment organic revenue down 10%, we expected another difficult quarter at Belvac and in retail refrigeration results came in line with forecasts, margin performance in the quarter was negatively impacted by volume in refrigeration and mix at Belvac. The segment also incurred transitory costs associated with product rationalization programs in refrigeration and preparation for our automation efforts to be built out in 2019. Positively, retail refrigeration bookings were up for the first time in six quarter during the period as project activity has increased. As we presented in September, we've begun in earnest to address our footprint and productivity actions by starting in our Unified Brands business. As it is the clearest path to improving margins in the segments, we are in the planning and preparation phase for our automation and production consolidation programs and refrigeration and have committed 2019 capital spending to fund these projects. We're cautiously optimistic for improved revenue performance in 2019 for the segment based on our initial 2019 order backlog and retail refrigeration and according activity as you see in our full year guidance. So let\u2019s move on to the guidance. Our full year guidance is made up of the following, 2% to 4% organic revenue growth, 2% to 3% total revenue growth positively impacted by acquisitions of 1% offset by foreign exchange of 2%. We expect the FX impact to be concentrated from the first half of the year. You can see the tax rate. I'm going to deal with CapEx on the following slide. The range and free cash flow conversion reflects the announced restructuring programs that there is a back-up slide on and adjusted EPS, EPS guidance of 565 to 585. Guidance does not include unannounced footprint actions to be taken in 2018. So let's go and take a look at the EPS bridge in the following slide. As a starting point for 2018, EPS is normalized for the full year discrete tax items as you can see at far left. Contributions for the 2019 EPS guidance were as follows. $0.39 from incremental SG&A rightsizing carried into 2019 as well as the impact for announced footprint actions. We have included supplemental slides in the backup for you to take a look at. $0.08 per share from the Belanger acquisitions, which we closed in January 25th, $0.19 to $0.39 of conversion of the revenue range and $0.15 from tax rate which is a negative as well as the share count reduction from 2018 repurchase program, it does not include any 2019 share repurchases leaving us to the EPS guidance. The last slide is moving on to capital expenditure. CapEx is forecasted to increase in 2019, approximately 30% to 40%, driven by several significant projects. 26 million greenfield plant will support the growth of our colder connector business, which has an outstanding year and it's a business that we have targeted for investment. The plant will become fully operational in 2020, and initial 15 million investment in automation and retail refrigeration to improve productivity and enable footprint consolidation, which is scheduled to come online progressively in the second half. Excluding these large structural investments, CapEx is in line with historical averages between 2 and 2.5 of revenue despite significant investment in our digital initiatives. To wrap-up, Dover enters 2019 with solid momentum as represented by our Q4 organic growth rates, solid order backlogs across most of the portfolio, and margin expansion potential driven them by volume and cost initiatives. We are delivering on our September commitments for cost alignment and reinvestment in the drilled platforms, which I've included in the supplemental schedules. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver solid top line growth and strong double-digit EPS accretion in 2019. Our guidance reflects a constructive demand environment, continued focus on margin improvement and rightsizing programs as well as disciplined deployment of capital underscored by the recent acquisition of Belanger. And that concludes the presentation and we will open to questions, Andrey. Andrey Galiuk : Maria, we can open-up to the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. And the floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Steve Tusa : Just curious, so CapEx going up quite a bit next year yet you are still guiding to kind of 8% to 12% of sales and free cash flow. Can you -- I know, there is some noise around restructuring this year and maybe obviously some working capital headwinds. Can you maybe just help us kind of bridge the gap there and the other moving parts outside the CapEx? Richard Tobin : Sure, I think like Brad covered, we gave a, let's call it normalized cash flow for the cash impact of restructuring operations. So, maybe we're just under 10% for the year. And with the strong revenue growth in Q4, we had some amount of cash flow that was hung up in receivable. So, if you take a look at next year, the revenue growth is not at that same kind of momentum, so we would unwind that Q4 revenue through cash flow. And quite frankly, it's not as if we\u2019re performing at 100% in terms of cash conversions. So I\u2019m making up that 30 million to 40 million over the year, we've got the ability to do it. So, I don't think it's -- I know that we were forecasting to spend more for CapEx, we believe in the projects we\u2019re doing it. But we don't think that, that spend on CapEx is negatively impact the cash flow target for 2019. Steve Tusa : And then just quickly on product ID. I\u2019m not sure if you've mentioned this in the prepared comments, but how orders there in the fourth quarter? And then, there was the smaller cap here to talk about some weakness in digital printing. I know you guys, digital printing is not, it's maybe not comparable across the board. Are you guys seeing anything there with regards to trends globally and demand for what\u2019s been a pretty strong growth business? Richard Tobin : Yes, I mean, look at digital printing in terms of its margin performance year-over-year did a fantastic job. But as you know, these are high dollar printers, so the revenue tends to be little bit lumpy. It is reflected in our book-to-bill in printing, and ID is not so much the Markem-Imaje piece, it's more just the lumpiness of the orders, but our expectation for digital print for 2019 is to increase revenue. Brad Cerepak : I would just add that Markem-Imaje has been steady all year along at above one book-to-bill and so that business remains solid for us. Steve Tusa : So I guess digital printing was the reason for kind of the weaker orders in the quarter, I think you said they were down? Richard Tobin : Yes, it's just a lumpiness of when which will be allowing us. Operator : We will move on to Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Just a question just to clear up sort of unannounced footprint consolidation, I assume its food refrigeration and automation actions related to it. Can you expound on that? Can you just explain to us what that is? Richard Tobin : Necessarily, I mean, we're investing in retail refrigeration and automation that is going to progressively come online, so expand the capacity of the footprint in Richmond. So, it's not alluding to that necessarily. I mean that\u2019s a project that is going to take more or less the whole year to get online. Andrew Obin : And that's all we have announced in terms of food refrigeration right now. Richard Tobin : The only thing we've announced in terms of -- that segment is the consolidation in United brands bringing the footprint from 3 to 1 which is underway. Andrew Obin : And then the second question, just going back to cash flow this range of 8 to 12. Can you bracket what drives the range? And I remember at C&H cash was a big focus when you came in. How are you changing the systems inside Dover to achieve that better cash flow in the long run? Richard Tobin : Dover's historical cash generation has not been pour by any stretch imagination. I think that what we did was wide in the range for cash generation, just to open-up business and recycling of the business, which is more revenue related and capital consumption from CapEx. So at the end of the day, if you take a look at what was generated for full year of '18, we came slightly below 10%, if we normalize for the cash cost of the restructuring actions. Despite the fact that having CapEx up a little bit, we're getting little bit penalized in Q4 because of the fact that the growth rate was so robust. So, you've got some amount of cash that's hung up in receivable. So, on one hand, we don't want to manage that cash number where to the extent that we are not taking orders and making deliveries because we prefer to have the operating profit quite frankly. So, what we -- the way that we look at it here and should look at here is, it's a self liquidating balance sheet, right. We accommodate the negative impact of higher revenues. We're taking the earnings and we've just got to get really good at cycling our receivables and working on our payments, so just kind of the working capital point of it. But on the other hand, it's not as if we can get quartered into 10% of revenue where we say wait a minute stop shipping, if you will. Andrew Obin : That makes sense. The perception, I think, was that the Apergy business was a big cash generation and ex- Apergy I think was nice to see the cash is still very good. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : And just back to refrigeration, I mean I guess unannounced restructuring is not announced, but if the automation and refers increasing your capacity in Richmond, it certainly follows that we need to make some other moves at some point in that business I would think or you in fact see growth clearly picking-up where you are not as a situation or you have over capacity. Richard Tobin : That demand levels that we forecasted for 2019, we will be over capacitized. Jeffrey Sprague : And just thinking about these orders, Rich, in refrigeration you're seeing now is the pricing on orders such that you know you feel better decent on the margins trajectory and refrigeration over the course of 2019? Richard Tobin : I'd like the pricing to be better is the honest answer, but we've modeled in kind exit pricing or current market conditions. One would hope, if demand was to accelerate in excess that what we've modeled in year that there would be some room for pricing. But right now, I think that we've got a pretty cautious view about demand and pricing for retail refrigeration in '19. Jeffrey Sprague : And then just one other one, it'd never occur to me that Unified Brands that have been that big of restructuring opportunity, but is this something that you get executed fairly quickly here in the first half? Or it's just thrown out over some period of time? Richard Tobin : Don't look at the supplemental chart and say that's all unified brand, a piece of that is Unified Brands, but there's a variety of other smaller projects in there. Unified Brands tends to be the one we're using as example because the footprint consolidation is quite large and we started that in Q4 and it's pretty much going to take us through the first half of 2019 to complete. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citibank. Andrew Kaplowitz : Richard, at your analyst day, you mentioned that DFS was finalizing a path to 15% to 17% margin. You mentioned in your third quarter call, but you\u2019re happy would DFS' exit margin rates. It does look like marginal overall influence is quite good. So how much has DFS already improved in margin? And has the improvement been faster than you expect? Richard Tobin : The DFS margin in Q4 was slightly below the exit rate of Q3, but that was entirely driven by geographic mix. So, it's been sequentially getting better through 2018, and as I mentioned in my comments, one of the -- if you look the -- if you do the math on the incremental margin on the EPS bridge, you\u2019re going to see at the lower end of the revenue side that it's pretty robust. A lot of that is the non-reoccurrences some of the issues that we dealt with in 2018. I think the margin targets that we showed in 2019 September are real and were going to be tracking progressively to realizing those margins through 2019 under current demand scenarios. Andrew Kaplowitz : That\u2019s helpful, Rich. And then maybe you can breakdown a little more the 17% growth in fluids? I mean you talked about strength in pumps and process solutions. The B&B impact in the core to pick up in the quarter and with the booking strength in the segment is it fair to say that there is relatively high confidence in the 3% to 4% growth forecast for 2019 given the back of that you have. Richard Tobin : We like our exit growth rate and we like our book to Bill and that is reflected in what we\u2019re expecting -- that we're putting out there for the guidance for the segment. As you know what we have what we can see is into Q2 at the present time. So, we feel good were we are despite a lot of negativity in terms of sentiment about the demand environment for everything going into 2019. So we feel good about the forecast that we have out there. In terms of the growth rates, the fastest growing portion was DFS or Fluids or the Fluids business of the other retail fueling. But have been said that, the balance the portfolio really grew well. We've commented before I think in Q2 and maybe to a lesser extent of Q3 on the MAG business which is very much project-related. That was a large contributor to the growth in the incremental margin also for the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just the question around the capital deployment, I think you've noted that the assumptions for 2019 on EPS not embedded much in the way of extra buyback or overseeing any unannounced M&A. So maybe update us on how you will see your capacity for capital deployment at least this year, even if you\u2019re not giving us guidance on the buyback? And how you see the preference of acquisitions versus buybacks to use that capital? Richard Tobin : Sure, well, I think in terms of the hierarchy, it's the same as we are presented in September that we've got a bias for organic investment because that's what the returns are highest. And really the biggest change year-over-year is what we\u2019re doing in terms of organic investment, which has reflected in the CapEx slide. We just completed an acquisition or in inorganic investment in the car wash equipment business, we gave the criteria and what we're looking for in September in terms of margin expansion, execution risk and return on invested capital hurdles. That particular one meets all three so we feel quite good there. We've got a reasonably good pipeline that we're taking a look at right now. And the size of that pipeline in terms of scale of those opportunities are more or less around where that Belanger acquisition. So that's the kind of color, I can give you on whether well executed or not we use to say, but we're not going to sit on cash as we build up through the year. Julian Mitchell : And then my second question would be going back to the fluids business, again, talk about any updated thoughts around the U.S. retail fueling build-out, not just the revenue assumptions maybe for this year and medium-term for that EMV aspect, but also I guess, how you are handling that in terms of working capital build, which was something you've mentioned once or twice from the prior earnings call? Richard Tobin : I'll deal with the working capital one, and I'll let Brad take the EMV because of course we always have an EMV slide somewhere around here. Yes, on the working capital slide of DFS or retail fueling, I think we have the conversion on our order it was as very robust in Q4. So, we go into 2019 with not a lot of inventory, but we do have is the receivable balance from that strong growth. So in total working capital, we had highlighted the fact earlier in the year that we were going to build safety stock to accommodate what we thought was going to be a robust demand environment. We got it at the end of the day, but from a working capital point of view, if there is any negativity of growing, it's the fact that we hugging up on receivables, but I'll leave it to Brad to comment on what -- how we have been participated in Q4 and what our view on EMV is for 2019? Brad Cerepak : Sure, Rich. When I speak about EMV, just a reminder, I'm not talking about dispensers that are EMV ready. It's really the component pieces and we see on track and track it very, very carefully. I would say second half of '18 including the fourth quarter was above '17. So, we came out of that air pocket in the first half. Sequentially, we go into '19 and we see growth sequentially and solid year-over-year growth in EMV. I would say DFS, our business leadership is really very, very confident in terms of how we see in our line of sight to EMV for 2018 based on discussions with our customers and specific projects. So, EMV is shaping up to be the year-over-year up into '19 sequentially improving throughout the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So, I just want to touch on the bookings in terms of the booking growth. Obviously, you went through a lot of detail in the slide, but I'm curious because number one, it's board based. And secondly, it's terms of going to be one of the best we see this quarter. So, is there anything difference about the investments you've made or the structure that you put in place that could explain the inflection orders? Or is it just one of the things? Richard Tobin : I think that it's one of those things. I mean I think it's a reflection of the fact of the exit rate on the growth. I think it's a reflection on in certain businesses that lead times have gotten extended because of supply chain. I mean there is an overall view I think in the market because of strains of tariffs and a variety of things that, that people are getting worried at the performance of supply chains to a certain extent. So, they are getting in front a little bit of -- getting in line for what they believe that the need for 2019. So, overall, I don't think there is anything in there except for the fact that we've been on a pretty good -- our businesses have been a pretty with the exception refrigeration, being in a good place in terms of top line growth, and there is an overhang and worry about our supply chain getting extend in a variety of other things. And that's allowed us to go out and ping our customers and say, look if you really want first half deliveries you got to get in line. Nigel Coe : And then just going back to Steve's question on free cash flow, the 8% to 12% is obviously a very wide range but $3 million of bandwidth on free cash flow. I understand the CapEx headwind, but is there anything else that's highly variable within your free cash builds cash restructuring et cetera? Maybe explain that why that wide range? Richard Tobin : It would be growth at the end of the day. Our expectation is we would actually underperform when the top line is moving up aggressively, and we would over perform as the businesses liquidate the balance sheet or at the midpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mircea Dobre of Baird. Mircea Dobre : Just going back to refrigeration here and I understand that you guys remain cautious into 2019 that business struggled a lot, but orders were finally decent maybe for the first time in almost two years. So I\u2019m wondering, if there is something specific in the quarter of any customer, anything that happened will be discreet? Or is this marketed finally starting to turn around a little bit? Richard Tobin : I think it's not any particular customer. It's broad-based since our traditional customers. I think overall it's just a reflection of capital investment in retail food as been low for quite a long period of time, and it's coming off easier and easier comps as regards to the cycle. So, we\u2019re grateful for it. I think it's good for morale in the business, but we remain cautious and we like to just continually update it hopefully, quarter by quarter, if these kinds of trends hold. Mircea Dobre : In terms of what you're hearing from your sales people, is it any particular vertical on? I mean is it dollars store? Or the big retailers and anything else you can say about demand? Richard Tobin : I don\u2019t want to get into individual customers, but its big box and all other. Mircea Dobre : Lastly, on Belvac, anything you can talk about in terms of demand, and I presume that the comps getting a lot easier going forward. How do you think about that business in '19? Richard Tobin : If we go back and look at Belvac's performance overtime, it's the lumpy. I think it's just become more material to the segment because of the fact that refrigeration shrunk so much. So, there is nothing particularly wrong with Belvac because it\u2019s a CapEx driven business from the beverage side and it was just a bad year, a lot of projects got deferred in a variety of other things. So I think we've also got a cautious view. We're engaging with all of our customers where we'd like to see the backlog build sequentially and then will comment it over the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : I don\u2019t know much about this car wash equipment business, but maybe this would be a good opportunity late in the queue just for you guys to help educate us a little bit. I mean how many other opportunities out there -- are there out there to really roll it up? Is it already consolidated? Is it just help us understand really where you going with it? Richard Tobin : Yes, I don\u2019t know if I want to opine on kind of one of ours longer-term strategy. I mean just back up and saying that, that within the OPW, there had been a car wash business PDQ, it's been accretive to both of the segment and the Company. We like the trends in carwash. This particular acquisition is of a size that we think that it's from an execution point of view, it's very doable for us and it widens our portfolio and our strength with our distributors. I mean now that we've got a total product to go along with our traditional position. So, we like the secular trends in carwash in terms of the growth profile and we like our historical performance in terms of margin. And like I said, we check the box on return hurdles and execution risks. It's a fragmented market, there is -- but at the other hand, it's now that we've done this acquisition, we are one of the largest players at least in North America. So, we like the market structure also, but I think and to the extent that there is additional opportunities we continue to take a look at him, but it really did check a lot of boxes for companies that we're looking for. Scott Davis : And then I'm sure you guys are sick and tired to answering questions on refrigeration, but I'm going to pile on a little bit. What's been the customer response to cutting SKUs, cutting capacity? I mean generally in understanding that the customer level that you just don't have a choice and we need to make these moves? Or has there been some sort of pushback particularly in the SKU risk rationalization? Richard Tobin : Yes, no one like this at the end of the day, I think that our track record in the second half of the year in terms of trying to run the business while preparing it for a transformational change, I'm sure that we have made some of our customers unhappy. I think that we're working diligently to kind of layout the path where this gets our costs and control, and we believe very much that it's going to improve our quality overtime. But having said that, I think that the businesses has been around a long time, I think there is an amount of goodwill, but clearly, we're going to need to execute on this project as we go - it's probably the biggest project that we have in right now for 2019. Operator : Our question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. John Inch : So just how does the quarter progress? And I ask the question because some companies have called out a softer December, particularly end of December, some have called out sort of a softer October, the pick-up and back-up in November. And I'm just curious because obviously you don't have necessarily a broad line of economic businesses or kind of specific to Dover. But the trends that you saw against the backdrop of global economy softening, softening in Asia. Does that give you any kind of pause or what to watch for as this quarters come through in 2019? Richard Tobin : I think that our biggest worry in the quarter was conversion of what we had in the backlog. I think we got a little bit, in a perfect world we would converted it earlier in the quarter and not had to run like crazy during December from both a production point of view and from a cash point of view. But as I said in my opening comments, it got a little dicey, but we are able to get it out the door and collect it. So, I think from an execution point of view, I think that the organization should be proud of itself. We dispatch the segment management to China because we read the same things that everybody else did. So, segment management spent a week in China recently to go and see how it's impacting our business and like. Our management in China is feeling pretty confident. Now we've got really to revenue streams in China, it's the consumables portion of marketable marsh which is relatively stable business and then the regulatory piece of fluids, which is geared towards OPW, which is generally has a decent line of sight in terms of backlog. So were cognizant of the risk out there. But right now our projections for China are to grow in 2019. John Inch : In the last recession refrigeration got clipped and what's different about this program depending on how the economy plays out, but at some we will get another recession. Refrigeration obviously not stopping or starting up a high base, and I\u2019m just curious, you as a company have talk about the fact that the next downturn you perform much better obviously given Apergy is no longer there, but what about refrigeration? I mean are we at a base level that if there was a broader economic downturn you think that it would perform better? Or is it just the lower base in which its still go down the way it's done historically? Richard Tobin : John, I can\u2019t add anything to what you said. I haven't been around long enough to really think about specifically as it relates to refrigeration but you put your finger on it at the end of the day if was to happen this year god forbid, we had such a low base in refrigeration, we\u2019re below replacement at this point. John Inch : Okay, so it's fair to say you feel obviously I think very good about the base at least in the context of possible risks to the economy without words in your mouth? Richard Tobin : I think I will feel really good if we execute our plans in 2019. I mean 2018 was a tough year for the management of the business and for us. I think we got a good plan. I want to see this executed and I\u2019m going to feel a lot better about it. John Inch : Just lastly, Rich and Brad, the 18 million the benefit you called out from near-term footprint consolidation presumably this is part of a Phase 1if you will and Dover's evolution. Where would you put this in that context? You've talked about the 200 manufacturing warehouses. Is this any way to size this in any sort of way or\u2026 Richard Tobin : I think the way to answer, John. Yes, I think the way to answer is twofold that when we had the meeting in September, we said that the priority was to go after SG&A first because it was a one-for-one benefit and it was in your control so you can execute it. Now we said we moved on to footprint is a lot more risky and the timing of acting on footprint is a lot longer. So that's why you see us taking a relatively small charge in the end of 2018, and the real benefit that the total benefit is in 2019. So, the returns as you calculate the returns there are excellent, but we've got to run a business here, right. And we don't want to impact the top line, so we're pretty, pretty deliberate about how we execute these things. John Inch : But in the big picture Rich could even if it takes several years good footprint/PHASE 2b as big as the SG&A? Richard Tobin : I don\u2019t want to size, but that was relatively small start that we've taken and we are forecasting 18 million. So, we look that this is a multiyear program. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Want to circle back on Fluids. And Rich, you talked about one of the benefits because, first of all, we don't see organic growth rate in that segment as strong as 17%. So can you take us through with any more color the impacts of mix and pricing? And then you also said there was a benefit of some of the cost out there as well? Richard Tobin : I don\u2019t want to start. I think we can do those with follow ups. I think at the end of the day the two biggest driving issues within the segment where retail fueling, we've been talking I guess in the second half of the year that because of footprint consolidation, we got a little bit behind in terms of our backlog and we had a lot of catch-up to do. Plus the fact Brad took you over -- took you through that EMV is starting to come through, which is a positive for 2019. And the fact that we've talked about earlier in the year, some of the margin was related to mix and that's project related work that's driven by the MAG business. So what we got in Q4 was very good conversion, and maybe not so much in EBITDA as much as we had like in EBIT, but on the top line of converting of the backlog in the retail fluids business and a lot of shipments out of MAG, which are good for margins. Deane Dray : And then you mentioned tariffs as a factor in fluids and then, can you also address how you did in oil and gas broadly away from retail fueling? Richard Tobin : The tariff related what I mentioned about tariffs is, the fact that we believe that it is contributing a little bit for the building of backlog, right. Everybody is worried about the supply-chain, which kind a piece of that is tariffs. So customers that have plans CapEx driven plans the demand plans for 2019, we feel that's what's contributing somewhat to the good order book that we have. In terms of our view on tariffs, we will be able to cover the tariffs impact with pricing and productivity and that's our expectation for 2019. Deane Dray : And oil and gas? Richard Tobin : Our oil and gas exposure now is relatively low with the spinoff of Apergy. Deane Dray : But you still have a residual oil that shows up in midstream, any color there? Richard Tobin : It's not an overly material number and quite frankly because a lot of our pumps business is sold through distribution. I mean I guess we can do the work at the end of the day, but it's hard to parse it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : So I guess my first question is just on the CapEx investments Rich and how are you're thinking about the expected pay back from those investments? Richard Tobin : What we wouldn\u2019t be doing them and much we had positive NPVs on them at the end of the day. I called out the two bigger ones because they got a little bit of different profiles, right. So, it was to kind of message in terms of what we will consider only do big CapEx projects. One was on the colder business, which is our connector business, I believe it was the fastest growing or maybe in second place fastest growing business that we had in 2018, and the margin is positive to both the segment in the group. So if we are going to invest in capacity expansion that's a pretty good candidate. So, we like the dynamics of that business and we were getting chockablock in terms of our ability to grow based on our footprint. The other one is driven by what we're doing in terms of retail refrigeration and that let\u2019s put that in kind of the productivity bucket rather than kind of the expansion bucket. And both have different dynamics in terms of how we model the return but both of them are very NPV positive as long as we execute correctly. Joe Ritchie : That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just my one follow one. When you think about the $72 million and incremental SG&A savings that come through this year, how are you thinking about that coming through? Should it all be -- should be pretty linear just given that the actions were taken in 2018? Richard Tobin : Yes, that\u2019s where we think about it, linear. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Joshua Burzynski of Morgan Stanley. Joshua Burzynski : Rich just first question on some of the footprint consolidation and some of the longer term optionality. I know it's probably premature to size it, but thinking about the percentage of the footprint that's been evaluated so just looked at so far. What is that 18 million of savings really comprises? Is a bit, you looked at two-third of the business, you looked at 25%? Just trying to get a sense for at least what's gotten kind of the first blush so far. Richard Tobin : I think that we\u2019ve taken a look at the entire footprint, but not -- so cursory view of identified opportunities by operating company. Then we've kind of put them in order in terms of our ability to execute both as a group and by then an individual operating company. And so, we force rank them based on that. So, we've got a relatively long pipeline, but execution risk and some is a lot higher than others. They need to do it from margin enhancement point of view. It's higher than some than others. I think that we signaled in September the two segments that are challenge from a margin point of view. So our bias would be to act there first, but then it comes back to the organization's ability to execute, and we're bringing in resources in 2019 to kind of accelerate our way through 2019. But the fact of the matter is the group's track record in doing facility consolidation is not great. So, we want to be relatively deliberate and get some momentum of successful projects and then begin to roll. Joshua Burzynski : And then, I think a couple of questions to kind of nip at the edges of this. But Fluid guidance of 3% to 4% organic coming off of a pretty big quarter I think an easy comp in the first quarter, good bookings, descent visibility with EMV and you've added up things should be probably through the high end or maybe even above the high end. I guess the one comment that you've made earlier and maybe the prepared remarks was about clearing some of the backlog there. Is that really what pulls that within the range Is more that you had some of this business with pent-up you've work through it in and maybe now the comp is not as easy as it appears as of the fourth quarter? Just trying to calibrate how do you stay within the range there? Richard Tobin : Yes, we have been having quite the dialogue around here between our very good performance and conversion and how that affected the top line versus what our guidance was going to be versus the market saying that there's a slowdown in horizon and everything else. We feel great about what happened in Q4. I don\u2019t think that we can keep that level up through the year, but there's no reason for us not to be at the top end of the range, but these are businesses that don't have a lot, I mean, they are so small in the nature, there's not a lot of secular stories behind them. So, we took kind of the middle-of-the-road view. And to the extent that the demand is there then will push the top end, as hard as we can sequentially to the quarters. But I think it would have been a little bit difficult for us to take Q4 and to say, well based on that in our backlog, this thing just rolls through '19. We just don\u2019t have enough visibility right now. Joshua Burzynski : No, I think that's fair. I guess the question is relative to rest of the business it seems like you baked in more of a soft landing from a macro perspective there than elsewhere. Is that kind of a starting point? Richard Tobin : That's fair. Operator : And thank you, that concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Galiuk for closing remarks. Andrey Galiuk : This concludes our conference call. Thank you for your interest in Dover and we'll look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's fourth quarter 2018 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Richard Tobin : Thanks, Andrey. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us to this morning's conference call. Let's gets started on Slide 3. Q1 organic revenue was up 8.3% for the quarter, driven by very strong performance in our fluid segment, solid trading conditions in engineering systems, and modern improvement in Refrigeration & Food Equipment markets with food retail business, posting top line growth for the first time in six quarters. Adjusted segment earnings increased 24% to $251 million, 230 basis point improvement over the comparable period driven by cost cash and carry forward, good performance on price realization versus input costs headwinds and volume leverage across the portfolio. Adjusted Q1 earnings were up 29% to $182 million and adjusted EPS of $1.24 per share was up 38%. Discrete tasks items added $0.06 of favorable EPS impact. As announced, we completed the divestiture of Finder pump manufacturer, serving the upstream oil and gas industry. This asset is still reflected in our Q1 results and we recorded a loss on sale of $47 million, which reflects the write-off of intangible assets and the elimination of accumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment or CTA as required by accounting standards. Overall, we're pleased to get off to a good start in 2019. Demand remains robust across much of the portfolio. We are delivering on our cost programs, incremental margins on volumes for the most part solid, and we are pleased with the bookings increased in Refrigeration & Food Equipment segment. There remains much to do to deliver on our full year objectives, but it's encouraging to get out of the blocks with positive momentum. And I'll hand it over from Brad from here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks Rich. Good morning everyone. Let's go through the details starting on Slide 4. Revenue grew 5% to $1.7 billion and as mentioned, it was driven by strong demand in Engineered Systems and Fluids and improvement in Refrigeration. GAAP EPS increased 3% to $0.72. Moving to non-GAAP results. As mentioned, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBIT and margin all increased substantially, reflecting solid margin conversion on growth and cost actions. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $317 million or 18.4%. Key adjustments for non-GAAP results this quarter were acquisition-related amortization, loss on assets held for sale related to Finder and restructuring and other expenses. The EPS increase was supported by $0.06 or $8.4 million of discrete tax benefits versus $0.03 in the first quarter of the prior year. Turning to Slide 5. Let's get into a little more detail on our revenue and bookings results in the quarter. As mentioned in our summary, organic growth was strong at 8.3% with all three segments seen positive organic top line momentum. The impact from FX was a 3.4% headwind. From a segment perspective, Engineered Systems grew $39 million or approximately 6% organically and Fluids grew $95 million or 15% organically on broad-based activity across both segments. Refrigeration & Food Equipments revenue increased $2 million which represents 0.7% organic growth. Organic bookings were essentially flat year-over-year. All-in bookings declined $42 million or 2% versus the first quarter of the prior year primarily due to FX headwinds. Backlog increased 5% compared to the end of Q4, most notably in Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Organic bookings for Engineered Systems declined $33 million or approximately 4% driven by expected reduction in new order inflow in our industrial businesses, particularly, environmental solutions group, which had a large backlog increase last quarter. Organic bookings in Fluids increased $29 million or 4% with strong order activity in pumps and process solutions, while retail fueling and transport continue to work through the backlog from last year. Bookings in Refrigeration & Food Equipment grew $6 million organically. Rich will provide additional color on performance in some of the individual businesses later. Finally, overall book-to-bill finished at 1.03, reflecting healthy orders across our segments. From a geographic perspective, the U.S. our largest market grew 7% organically where we saw a strong growth in Engineered Systems and Fluids. Europe was up 14% organically with strong performance across all segments and Asia was up 5%. Within Asia, China grew 1% organically driven by growth in our Fluid segment offset by a slight decline in Engineered System. The rest of Asia, which represents a revenue base about the size of China for us, grew at 9% primarily driven by Fluids. Let's go to the earnings bridge on Slide 6. Starting on the top. Engineered Systems adjusted segment EBITDA improved 19 million, largely driven by strong conversion on broad based revenue growth across the segment, more than offsetting headwinds from FX. Fluids EBITDA growth of 32 million reflects a combination of robust growth continued margin improvement in retail fueling as well as strong conversion on volume and other businesses. The 3 million decline at Refrigeration & Food Equipment reflects lower volume in Belvac as well as unfavorable shift in business mix. Additionally, our broad base rightsizing initiatives have been delivering savings as expected and improved margins across all segments. Going to the bottom chart, adjusted earnings from continuing operations improved 41 million or 29%, primarily driven by higher segment earnings offset by higher taxes. Interest expense was lower in the quarter. Now going to Slide 7. Free cash flow for the quarter was a reasonably expected negative 13 million, which is an improvement over last year. The first quarter is traditionally our lowest cash flow quarter. In the quarter, strong top line growth was supported by working capital investment of 138 million, with over two-thirds of the year-over-year change, driven by increased accounts receivable. Capital expenditures was 37 million. With that, I'll hand it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : All right, thanks Brad. I'm on Slide 9. Engineered Systems had a solid broad base quarter with top line organic growth of 5.8%. Incremental margin conversion in the quarter was very strong driven by volume leverage, productivity improvements and cost actions. Our Printing & ID business delivered strong organic growth with double-digit growth in digital printing. Despite the weak GD prints in Europe, demand in the region is robust during the quarter for this platform. The industrial platform performed well with most businesses posting mid-to high-single-digit growth rates. Our ESG business continued to deliver strong growth on unit delivers. But more importantly, we're very pleased with the traction the business is getting in assistance and software products. TWG and MPG contributed mid single digit growth and margin expansion supported by constructed demands in the respective end markets. Trading conditions in our vehicle services industrial clamps businesses are more challenging largely as a result of input cost headwinds and exposure towards European markets. Going into Q2 bookings for Engineering Systems remain solid. The segment posted book-to-bill above one. In Fluids, the segment posted organic growth of 15% for the quarter with the majority of the portfolio posting double-digit growth rates. Incremental margin was 43%. As volume leverage, increased productivity and cost controls more than offset the impact of unfavorable product and geographic mix and inflation. Our pumps and process solutions business had an excellent quarter with organic growth rate of 10%. Volume conversion was significantly accretive to platform margins as a result of good price and productivity versus cost ratio and improved mix of products and services delivered. Fueling and transport posted exceptional top line growth of 20% as demand remained robust and production performance in our operations gained traction. Margin conversion on volume was improved quarter-to-quarter and we expect that trend to continue to the balance of the year as we track towards meeting our margin objectives that we had targeted in September. Moving onto Refrigeration & Food Equipment, organic revenue was up 1%, improved bookings in the fourth quarter translated into Q1 organic revenue growth of 1.9% in food retail, which was the first positive revenue rating in the last six quarters. Quotation and booking activity in food and retail remain constructive with the book-to-bill of 1.15, particularly in core refrigerated case product line and was in line with expectations in the first quarter. Unified Brands faced slower demand at the beginning of the year in the institutional market, but the environment has been progressively improving and the business has posted single digit growth in Q1. Margin performance for quarter was negatively impacted by volume at Belvac customer mix translation from SWEP and transitory product redesign cost in the food retail as we prepare for a large automation project. If current trends continue, we remain cautiously optimistic for improved revenue performance in 2019 for the segment in line with the expectations we've included in our annual guidance. On Slide 12 reconciles the key components of the comparable 38% increase in adjusted EPS. As we have forecasted, key contributors are delivering on a cost program and margin conversion on growth and to a lesser extent, it's rebasing our share count and tax benefits. As we noted, we've indicated the discrete tax impact on the EPS and consider our -- that'll put us at the low end of our ETR, our expected tax rate for the full year. Reflecting solid demand conditions that we see in the markets, we have increased our organic growth guidance by 1% in Fluids and Engineering Systems, and reiterate our prior guidance for Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Despite the negative 300 basis points foreign exchange translation headwinds to revenue in the first quarter, our full year estimate is 100 to 200 basis points. Dover has delivered on the solid start for the year which allows us to reiterate our full year guidance of $5.65 to $5.85 per share. To wrap up, Dover is maintaining solid momentum as it represented by our Q1 organic growth rate, solid bookings and backlogs across most of our portfolio, and margin expansion driven by volume, productivity and cost initiatives. We continue delivering on our commitments for improved performance, reinvestment in our growth platforms and disciplined portfolio management and capital deployment. With that, let's moving on to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : One of the questions we've been getting from investors this morning is that. Very nice beat in Q1. You've raised organic growth number for the year. Yet you kept the EPS. What are the headwinds do you have more concerns about second half, just if you could give us more color about the modeling process here for 2019? Richard Tobin : Alright, couple of things. We're clearly tracking towards the top end of the range at this point. I think that we're pleased with Q1's results. And it's always off to get -- it's always good to get off to a good start because we don't want to be in a position of chasing a comparative fourth quarter that we had last year. So to the extent that we're getting in front and we're in front last year because of the fact of production performance and DFS by our ability to a couple of things. If you look at the backlogs, there's some concern about the backlog is going down. But I would tell you that in ESG that particular business grew by 11% in the first quarter. So the conversion and the availability of our chassis was there, so we're able to convert on the revenue side and then you've got the backlog is going down in engineering systems, but we don't find that problematic because order covers in that particular segment goes well into the third quarter. In DFS, as you know, we've been struggling in terms of output. We had a high backlog exit of Q4. Production performance in DFS was excellent. So, it's another business that grew in the high, grew 17% in the first quarter. So, backlogs are going to come down because of production performance. I think the good news on the ESG conversion was the margin conversion rate was satisfactory. I think that we have work to do because we would have expected for the more, the accretive margins and DFS to be higher. I think we've got a plan to track that through the balance of the year. So overall, it's not a question of us being overly concerned about the metrics of backlogs. It's just purely a question of. We've got range -- we've got a range up to 585 a share. We're tracking towards that. We'd like to get another quarter under our belts so we get some visibility into Q4. And I'm sure we'll give an update at that point. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question, how has your thinking, your stock is up, everybody else stock is up. How do you think about cash in 2019 and within your previous range? And also how do you think about cash deployments in 2019? And has your thinking evolved given that the world is changing? Richard Tobin : We don't necessarily make decisions on share place as it relates to cash deployment. I think that we've clearly got a bias for inorganic growth and we've got some things in the pipeline. So to the extent that we can use our available cash, there we will. If we are unable to find inorganic opportunities then clearly we would average in terms of share buyback. So, overall, I think our thinking is consistent on that matter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : In terms of I guess the Refrigeration & Food Equipment business, margins slightly down there despite the encouraging organic top line performance. How should we think about margins in that division for the year as a whole? And how quickly should we expect those margins to start to grow year-on-year when looking at the balance of 2019? Julian Mitchell : Okay, Julian. Well, it's moving parts here, right? So part of the margin decline is on translation from our SWEP business, which is levered mostly towards Europe and Asia. So, you've got some translations decline there. Belvac, I think that we went through that in some details end of Q4. We said as part of our guidance for 2019 that we didn't have a lot of visibility for Belvac of the comps in the first half of the year. We're probably going to be poor and we'll see what happens in the second half of the year. That view is not changed. So that is dilutive to comparable margins year-over-year. The Refrigeration business, it's a bit of a tale of two cities. We're happy with the volume being up modestly. So that's going to be helpful to us, but we are doing a lot of work on that business in preparation for a large capital project that we're going to be initiating this year. So, we had some transitory cost on product redesign to allow that transition to happen. I think that we're well beyond that. So, we're thinking that we're probably going to get margin accretion going forward in the refrigeration platform. Julian Mitchell : And then secondly, when we're thinking about Fluids business, you did take up the organic growth guide slightly. You've got a very tough comp in the fourth quarter coming up. Maybe just talk about how you see fueling and transport playing out over the balance of the year in that context? And any updated thoughts around the EMV build out within the U.S. specifically? Richard Tobin : Sure. Well, I think you put your finger on it to a certain extent. We have a tough comp coming in Q4 and we have a lot of visibility into Q4. So depending on how this business develops and how EMV develops over the year, there is an opportunity for us to raise our revenue in that particular segment but we like to see some visibility there and be cautious only because the math works against us in Q4. Comments on EMV, the only thing that's been different for us so far is, we're shipping more full dispensary units than kits. So, we're getting more revenue, but that's actually dilutive to margins. So, we'll take it as it comes. I don't think the total value is about where we'd expected it to be, but I think that the mix that value is slightly different. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Rich, Europe up 14%, I think it was up 10% last quarter. You mentioned the strength in marking and coding, digital printing in particular. How are you able to maintain the stable momentum despite the weaker backdrop? Is it just really led by stricter regulation? And from what you could tell does the growth seems sustainable here? Richard Tobin : Yes, look, I mean, that's why I put it in the prepared remarks because that's the way that we look it here too. We're getting weak GDP prints out of Europe and we're taking that into account of our own forecast. But I think we'll just need to recognize that Europe is levered towards auto and machinery, and those markets are under pressure. And that necessarily is linked in any way to marking and coding. So, to a certain extent, marking and coding is not part of the process that's giving kind of pressure to European GDP prints. Look, we'll take it where we, as long as we can get it. It ends up being a business like digital printing. All of its revenue is European, but despite the fact that shifts globally. So, it ends up being recognized as European revenue. So, it's a bit of a misnomer to a certain extent. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, let me ask you the opposite question then around China. It seems like China has been decelerating to your little, Fluids up, Engineered Systems down. Can you give us some more color on marking and coding in China? Is there anything concerning going on there? I mean, do you still expect China to be up for the year for Dover on the strength in Fluids? Richard Tobin : Look, the environment is clearly slowed. We are up when it was a 1% for the quarter. Right now, I would expect it to be up for the year in consolidation whether it's slightly down in certain segments and slightly up in other. It's hard to say right now because we're working at 100 basis points. But overall, we would expect it to be up for the year. I don't really have a view on Printing & ID at this point. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Rich, on the automation project in Refrigeration in particular. Is this something you're going live on now as we speak, I think you said the preparation is behind you? And I'm just wondering about kind of managing through that on kind of a peak season as it were for Refrigeration? Richard Tobin : Yes, we're not going to become operational until Q1 of '20. What we're doing now is intervening on the configuration of the product itself to accommodate that change. So, which is part of the question on we've incurred some costs to allow for that transition. In terms of, if the volume goes up, are we going to get caught with our pants down to a certain extent? I think that we're lucky that we have adequate footprints to initiate this project, not at the same -- in the same physical location that we make the product at this time. So, we're reasonably comfortable that we're going to be able to accommodate any shift in demand during '19, if it comes, that we're not going to get caught sideways here. Jeffrey Sprague : Right, and on the factory issues in fueling. Are those completely behind you at this point? Or are there still some -- you're always going to be looking for efficiencies, but kind of the big obvious problems are those largely fixed now? Richard Tobin : Well, I think that the management deserves a lot of credit in terms of being able to get the throughput out. So part of the reason that the revenue was higher than we had forecasted into one is that we were being cautious in our ability to get the throughput out of those two main principle factories and they got them out. So, that's the good news. The not so good news is. The margin conversion on that volume is not entirely satisfactory. I think that we've got a plan to increase margins throughout the rest of the year. But look, we're able to get the units out and that's important. Now, we need to kind of grind down on efficiency on top of that volume leverage. Jeffrey Sprague : Just one last one from me. In terms of like cleaning out the closet from an asset standpoint, I mean, the Finder was a particularly bad deal legacy item obviously. But is there much more that that you're kind of breaking through kind of the smaller assets? Richard Tobin : Nothing, that looks like Finder. Operator : Your question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Steve Tusa : Good execution so far. On kind of the free cash flow, actually better than last year seasonally. How do we -- how should we kind of think about the seasonality of that free cash relative to prior years with everything that's going on? Should it be kind of roughly in line with what would what happened last year? Just kind of wanted to get some color on how 2Q and 3Q we're going to play out. Richard Tobin : One would hope that we don't wait till Q4 to get it all like last year and we're kind of progressively -- look, if I look at Q1, the inventory change relative to last year is lot smaller. So, which is a reflection of our ability to convert and I just answer the question about what we are doing in DFS and ESG. So, that's a function of not having industrial inventory because our conversion rates are going up. That I would expect, should improve through the year. On the receivables balance side, I guess it's a question of what do we think about revenues for the year and what do we think about fourth quarter? Right now, I like where we are right now with the strong Q1. I would have -- the fear around here was to kind of get through it and have to have and be forced into a position to get to the top end of our guidance of having another massive Q4. Now, we've brought some room there, so we've got an opportunity to look at how demand and backlogs developed over the year. Quite frankly if we get caught out a little bit on receivables because our volumes way up, I'll take the tradeoff between earnings and receivables. But I think that the core improvement that we can expect here is on the inventory side. Charles Tusa : And then just looking back to the fourth quarter and the strong orders. Is there anything -- any kind of pre-buy dynamics that you noticed there based on the tariffs and price increases just broadly? Richard Tobin : Yes, it's really hard to say. I think there is probably a little bit of an element of that because we've been trying to get price. So, as we're announcing price increases that drives let's get in front of that to a certain extent. In DFS in particular, I think it's no -- we've been pretty forthright that we were having issues about getting the throughput out of our factories, so that was building up a backlog for us. And that's a lot of what cleared in Q1. So that kind of normalizes backlog, if you will. It's hard to say, I mean I think by the end of this next quarter, we're probably have a really clear idea of where we are. But right now, we're never comfortable, but we feel good about the backlogs that we have across the portfolio. Charles Tusa : Okay, one last one on EMV. Any update on kind of the trajectory there accelerating, decelerating the back part of the year? Any updates on the EMV transition? Richard Tobin : As you listened to the comment before about dispensers versus kits, it looks like it's decelerating, because the last guys in are going to be kit-only and kind of our kit-only shipments right now are relatively low. So, it seems to be stretching out further. Charles Tusa : So, you're already kind of seeing deceleration, but it's a -- like you said before, it's kind of an elongated cycle. So, that's pretty different than what I think was the original assumption six months ago, which was very strong kind of '19 and then drop off, right? Richard Tobin : Yes, I think, but you've got -- it's a mix in revenue question. Right now, revenue looks great because we're doing the entire systems right. Charles Tusa : Yes. Richard Tobin : The margins around the kits and I think it's pretty intuitive, it says the last guys in aren't going to do a complete referb, they're just going to do the kits. So, I think that in our estimates and it's a funny one right, because the revenues less and the margins up. So, it's accretive to margins but dilutive to trajectory and revenue. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Rich, I was hoping you could give us the update progress report Phase 1, Phase 2, and then on the benefits we see they're lumped into corporate. How will they be spread over the segments for this quarter? Richard Tobin : Okay, I think, I understood the first question. I'm going to need some clarification on the second one. Where we are and you're talking about footprint? Deane Dray : Yes, right. Richard Tobin : We are -- look, what we've announced, let's consider that Phase 1. Phase 2, we need to deploy some capital, which we're doing now in order to move onto that particular portion of it. So, we're in a little bit of a transition period. And I think if you go back and look at our disclosures from Q4 about how we called out the capital investments that we're making those words to accommodate for their actions into the future. Other than that, that's really all I can say until we're ready to call one of them off, but we're making reasonably good progress. But some of the bigger moves that we need to make require initial capital. Deane Dray : So, the moves that you've made so far and the pay back on those, are we seeing that today in the results today? Because it looks like, it was all being carried in corporate as opposed to\u2026 Richard Tobin : I know I've got your question. You don't see anything in Q1. That's why, that's not there. This is zero in Q1. It's come for the footprint. Brad Cerepak : Yes, SG&A is there, if you were asking about the SG&A. Richard Tobin : So, it's not like to move the footprint pennies into another block, it just zero. Deane Dray : Got it. And what about SG&A then? Richard Tobin : SG&A, about beating a dead horse, we're clearly on track in delivering the objective because of the fact that we started in the second half of the year. You're going to get real good comps in Q1, Q2, then it will dilute in the second half of the year. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre of Baird. Mig Dobre : Just want to go back to price cost, I think, I heard you mentioned good price cost in Fluids. Maybe have you comment on the other segments? And how do you think about this dynamic through the year? Your cost specifically, how do you think those are going to progress through the years? Richard Tobin : I love it. We have Brad to correct me, but I think that in consolidation, we're slightly negative in price cost in Q1. We would expect to make progress on that through the year as price increases gain traction as we go throughout. In engineering systems specifically, we have done well on price cost. But in consolidation, it's slightly negative. Mig Dobre : So, but you said that price cost was positive in Fluids as well. So was it a drag in basically the remaining segment here? Richard Tobin : I think it's by platform. So, we're parsing now between individual platform was in the segments. I think the headwinds are in the industrial side, pieces of the industrial side of engineering systems, headwinds in refrigeration and food retail, doing this off the top of my head; and in fluids, I think that were positive overall. Mig Dobre : And then lastly. As you think about the full year, do you expect to be positive from a price cost standpoint? Richard Tobin : That's our expectation. Mig Dobre : Okay, great. Thank you. Brad Cerepak : It widens out a little bit to the back half. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Hey, Rich, ESG, so it was a big slug of the organic. You said you have enough back log to work through the third quarter and you're excited, I guess you said about systems and software. Do you expect the bookings to pick backup again? Just I call it out. I realized it's a small business, but it was an outsized impact right to the booking trends this Q. So\u2026 Richard Tobin : No, it's not that small of a business. Look, we don't have any visibility into Q4 at this point. So, despite grinding down some of the backlog that we had because of chassis availability and good production performance, the number like you know -- that's why it was called out in the presentation, it flexes the whole segment because of the total value of that business and its weight within the sector. We've got a really good backlog. I think that in any other year we'd to be super happy about what we've got. Let's get another quarter under our belt and we can probably say where we are for the full year, but we're into Q3 now which is pretty good. John Inch : Yes. I'm just trying to understand. You're not expecting an extending air pocket in future bookings based on what's where\u2026 Richard Tobin : I have no indication of that is going to happen. Brad Cerepak : No reason to believe that. John Inch : The SG&A stays for the year, I think $72 million. If I thought they we were going to be -- well, we just made an assumption maybe kind of linear, which suggested maybe $0.10 of benefit this Q, but it was 15. I don't want to split hairs, but did you pull some of that forward, which is not a bad problem to have or issue to have? Richard Tobin : Yes, I think that estimate, you know, I think that we knew from a comp point of view, it's going to be weighted towards the first half because we had 30 plus in the second half of last year. Getting it down to the millions of dollars, I mean we'll take it as it comes to a certain extent, right. Brad Cerepak : But there is -- let me just articulate here that, there is a slight difference in presentation just so you aware. The $0.15 is pure SG&A, not reinvestment, whereas before we were netting reinvestment in there, so I'll just clarify. So, the 50 -- we have reinvestment in the first quarter. I'd call it roughly $0.02, $0.03 of reinvestment. Reinvestment will ramp as we said before in this year. So, we're not changing our views on reinvestment. But you're looking at $0.15 in the quarter, which is we take it $28 million. So, you've got to think about that as pre-reinvestment. That will track to the back half pretty solidly except then you get the year-over-year the impact. Remember, we did $8 million in the third quarter, $22 million in the fourth quarter. So, again, I think, we're right on track where we expect it to be, maybe even a little bit higher based on the first quarter $0.15 print. John Inch : Yes. I was going to ask, did 72, has it changed? And it sounds like it maybe got up a little bit. Richard Tobin : Yes, slightly a little bit better. John Inch : Last question Rich. So selling Finder and we're working towards this portfolio, I guess, you're going to have a portfolio coming out partly in September. Can you talk a little bit about just your process? How you're working towards that? Like in other words, presumably there is got to be a lot of depth that occurred to then be able to say look, here is how I'm thinking about portfolio look done this clean up. But how do you go from sort of where you've been to where we're going to be able to talk that? Because I'm really curious how you're working through this? Richard Tobin : It's a really long answer. We are looking at future projections and return on invested capital by operating company, right, and then where they're performance relative to their peers and then relative to the market structure. Clearly, Finder comes out like a bit of a sore thumb, so it needed to be action quickly. I don't think that there's anything in the remaining portion of our portfolio that's got remotely the same dynamics that that does. So, I mean, we're looking at it holistically meaning that, it's not a question of portfolio purity, it's purely a question of future returns by operating company relative to their participation in the market structure. That's how I got it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : We covered a lot of ground already so just a few follow-up here. Obviously, great progress on the SG&A initiatives. I'm just curious Phase 2 is obviously more COG focused, but your SG&A is going to be relatively high compared to peers. I'm just wondering, if there's a Phase 2 in the SG&A beyond this year, Rich? Richard Tobin : Look, nothing of the quantum that that we've done, right. But understand in the background, there's a lot of what we're doing about these digital initiatives that enhance our ability to consolidate back offices. So but those are longer running programs that were running in the background as opposed to kind of just core let's kind of revisit what we've got. So I think that there is opportunity, but I don't expect that there's a Phase 2 SG&A takeout kind of low hanging Fluids. I think we're just going to have to, it's more SG&A goes into the total productivity equation now as opposed to and standalone. And to be fair, SG&A at Dover as got R&D and I think once we split R&D out of SG&A, we're going to comp better also. Nigel Coe : And then, there is a bit of friction around the 1Q setup for consensus, especially as it relates to the Fluids seasonality. So I'm just curious, if you've got any -- recognized you don't give quarterly guidance, but any commentary around 2Q in particular with regards to that how you see Fluids ramping up seasonally? And then maybe Refrigeration margins, how those look relative to the 1Q? Would you expect those to setup in a similar vein what we see normally? Richard Tobin : Yes, I mean, I think that the two businesses we've identified, both have a good dynamic in terms of their top line, which is helpful to us improving the margins of those two segments. So, I think progressively through the year, we expect to make progress in both of those particular segments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Burzynski of Morgan Stanley. Joshua Burzynski : I think to those the point of the last question we covered a lot of ground, but maybe just to stick with SG&A for a second. Rich, I think the initial progress there was pretty immediate, once you guys announced it. And I would imagine that, there were probably areas since then that you found maybe a bit more opportunity or perhaps on the other side where there was maybe some indiscriminate cuts. Should we see the shape of SG&A start to look a little different as you refine the program? Are you pretty satisfied with kind of the initial phasing? And how that went across the organization? Richard Tobin : I'm satisfied with the organization's ability to undertake, which was a difficult exercise and the speed of which is done. It's never going to end, but this was a particular program that we thought was important to identify and execute on. Once we reach that program limit relative to the restructuring charges that we took, it can foresee that these EPS bridges won't have that SG&A, any other ancillary benefit will rollover into conversion at the end of the day. So at a certain point, we're just going to stop reporting on it once we've reached conclusion, because then it becomes relatively discrete and it's not part of a program, right. What we said back in September is, if we take a charge for it, we're going to report back on delivery for that charge. Once, we've beyond that phase, it's just going to go back into conversion. Joshua Pokrzywinski : And then it's just a follow-up on Refrigeration. I guess similar to what you guys have talked about in Fluid. How should we think about the phasing of the year there? I think orders have been positive for a couple of years. You've built some nice backlog. Do we start to see revenue growth move closer and walk step with orders from here? Is there still going to be kind of another lag in that execution of those shipments? Richard Tobin : I don't know is the answer to that. I think that we can see in the backlog, we can see that from a production point of view, we're doing a decent job in terms of getting into that backlog. Now, we're really not seeing it yet in terms of the margin conversion, but I think that we have some transitory costs. I'd prefer to wait till the end of Q2 to kind of get more granular, but we're -- it's a positive thing. For the first time in six quarters, the backlog is up and our revenue went up. I think that we've still got a lot of work to see what that means in terms of kind of pre-industrialization margin performance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Graham of BMO Capital Markets. Scott Graham : Obviously, a lot asked, so mine are piggybacks on maybe some clarifications. Is it possible Brad on the ES bookings the organic? If we were to pull out the ESG, what that number -- what that minus 32 would look like? Brad Cerepak : When I think we can give you that is a follow-up, we haven't to calculate it. We can give you that one offline. Scott Graham : Okay. Secondly, on price cost, I know there was a question asked earlier, but kind of where you stand today with some price, some commodity prices going down and your pricing in? Would you expect at December 31 to be on a full year basis price plus neutral or sort of at December 31, price plus neutral? Brad Cerepak : I think that we will work our way there. We are slightly negative now. It is highly dependent on price realization. Our expectation is to be positive. I can't give you the quantum at the end of Q1. Scott Graham : That's fair. Last question is related to the Refrigeration business. I know that there is only so much you can say about that, but all of your customers have set their budgets for '19. Is there anything there that they're telling you that is of concern, moving towards more digital spending? It doesn't sound like it or are you just maybe a little bit guarded on saying anything right now or are they seeing anything negative about spending on your product on merchandizing? Brad Cerepak : No, not negative. I think which is reflective in the backlog. I just think that we're cautious on, they've got a 1% growth embedded in our forecasts would be like to take that off based on backlog. Yes, but I think there were cautious because we don't have a lot of visibility into the second half. Operator : Our next question comes from line Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : So just focused on the Refrigeration business for a second and the full commentary around price cost, I saw that pricing this quarter was pretty de minimis and you guys put the recent price last year effectively. I'm just wondering like. Are you expecting to get more price in that business this year? And then specifically on margins, is your expectation at this point that margins in the business will be up year-over-year? Richard Tobin : I think that we're cautious about price realization in this business and our expectation is from margins to increase in the Refrigeration segments of the business. In the segment, I think that we're going to have to wait and see because of Belvac's ability to swing margins. Joe Ritchie : And then I guess just my one follow-up and just again, just kind of focused on margins for a second in the Fluids segment. Can you give us an update on Wayne specifically and how that businesses doing? And what impact at all that's having potentially to margins as we saw pretty much flat this past quarter? Richard Tobin : Wayne, North America is doing very well in terms of production performance and margin. Joe Ritchie : So, Wayne, North America, okay, international, not as good? Richard Tobin : Right, I think that we've been pretty upfront that. Our -- the margin performance between our North American and European operations is quite wide. So part of the area of focus for us, meeting our objectives in that particular segment is to deal with a relative underperformance and in margins in Europe. Joe Ritchie : Rich, are you starting to see any of that turn it all? Or is this like a longer process and just maybe any color around that would be helpful? Richard Tobin : I think, to their credit that the European operations have fixed their throughput challenges. So, that's a big step and getting there, but we got a long way to go. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Charley Brady of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Charley Brady : On Refrigeration & Fluid Equipment on a transitory cost, can you quantify what the margin impact is on them in the quarter end? And if I heard you correctly, it sounds like those are essentially done, so that pressure isn't on the remainder of the year. Is that correct? Richard Tobin : No, I can, but I won't quantify them. Our expectation is that their impact going forward will be less than it had been in Q1. Charley Brady : And on the on the pumps business, obviously, pretty strong growth and bookings there. Can you just give a little more granular on we're seeing that? I think in the queue you talk about large in the OEMs, just what's driving that the strong growth in pumps? Richard Tobin : It is across the platform. So, it's not any particular business out of the few that are in there. I think that it's just across the entire platform. I think that market demand remains robust and I think that that our businesses are winning in the marketplace also. Charley Brady : Last one for me just on labor and freight costs. It is common what you're seeing their trend wise. Is freight getting any better? Are you seeing a tick down some of the rates? Or is it still tough sledding? Richard Tobin : I think we would have expected it to come down, but it's been offset by fuel surcharges. Now, the fuel is gone back up to four bucks a gallon of diesel, so net neutral. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Galiuk for closing remarks. Andrey Galiuk : Thank you. This concludes our conference call. Thank you for your interest in Dover and look forward to speaking you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's first quarter 2019 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

Also we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. With that, I would like to turn this call over to Rich. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us for this morning's conference call. Let's get started on slide 3. Q2 organic revenue was up nearly 3% for the quarter, driven by continued strong performance in our Fluids segment at 7% with all markets contributing to comparable growth and solid trading conditions in the industrials platform within Engineering Systems, which were able to more than offset forecasted slowdown driven by timing in our digital print business that I'll get into later in the presentation. Refrigeration & Food Equipment was short of projections principally as a result of tougher trading conditions in Asia for heat exchangers as well as refrigeration systems demand. Forecasted demand and recent customer wins particularly in retail refrigeration case and door give us confidence for an improved second half of the year. Adjusted segment earnings increased 13% to $311 million, contributing to 190 basis point improvement in operating margin over the comparable period. These results were driven by a strong revenue conversion in Engineered Systems and Fluids on volume leverage, good product mix, coupled with improvements in productivity and tight cost controls, more than offsetting raw material and labor cost inflation. Adjusted Q2 earnings were up 15% to $229 million and adjusted EPS at $1.56 a share was up 20%. As announced, we completed the acquisition of All-Flo Pump Co., a growing manufacturer of specialty pumps. This acquisition strengthens our leading position in the growing segment of positive displacement pumps for critical fluid transfer applications. Overall, we're encouraged by the results in the second quarter and the first half of 2019. Demand remains constructive across much of the portfolio. Our rightsizing and operational actions are yielding robust margin improvement. Dover entered the second half with a solid order backlog augmented by recent customer wins and as well as strong momentum and execution towards margin targets. And as a result, we are tightening the top half of our previous full year adjusted EPS guidance range to $5.75 to $5.85 per share. Now that's it for the opening comments. I'll pass it to Brad and then come back with the segment color. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Let's move to slide 4. Revenue grew by 1% to $1.8 billion and was driven by strong demand in Fluids and our industrial platform in Engineered Systems. GAAP EPS increased 25% to $1.35. Moving to non- GAAP results : As mentioned, we achieved significant margin accretion in the quarter with adjusted segment EBIT up 190 basis points over the prior year, reflecting continued execution of productivity initiatives. Our SG&A actions announced last year are for all intents complete and we are delivering the savings we expected. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $376 million, a margin of 20.8%. Key adjustments for non-GAAP results this quarter were acquisition-related amortization and rightsizing and other expenses. The EPS increase was supported by $0.02 or $3.6 million of discrete tax benefits on par with a $0.02 benefit in the second quarter of the prior year. Now moving to slide 5. Let's get into a little bit more detail on our revenue and bookings results in the quarter. As mentioned in our summary, organic growth was solid at 2.9%, driven by Fluids and Engineered Systems and partially offset by Refrigeration & Food Equipment. As you can see, foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue and bookings. FX was a significant 2.5% or $45 million headwind for revenue, which had an $8 million impact on earnings with the most notable impact in Engineered Systems, largely driven by printing and identification demand being levered to EMEA and Asia. The two largest contributors to the FX headwind were Europe and China, where average exchange rates declined against the dollar by approximately 6%. Based on current rates, we expect the impact to moderate in the second half of the year. We have used a $1.13 rate for the euro and a $0.15 for the RMB in our full year forecast. From a segment perspective, Engineered Systems grew $12 million or approximately 2% organically and Fluids grew $52 million or 7%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment's revenue decreased by $11 million or 3%. Bookings declined organically 1.7%. And as previously mentioned, we're also negatively impacted by FX. At Engineered Systems, organic bookings declined by $39 million or approximately 5.5% due to slower activity in digital printing and the Environmental Solutions Group. Bookings in Fluids increased by $52 million or 7% with strong order activity across the segment. Bookings in Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined $43 million. Rich will provide more information on the order book and individual businesses in a few minutes. Finally, overall order -- overall book-to-bill finished at a solid 1.0, while backlog at the end of Q2 was 2% higher than this time last year, driven primarily by Engineered Systems. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market grew 2% organically, driven by mid-single digit growth in Engineered Systems and Fluids, partially offset by Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Europe was up 8% with all segments posting organic growth and a particularly strong quarter from Fluids, which was up over 20% in EMEA. All of Asia was down 5% organically with China down 1%. Our Fluids business was up mid-single digits in Asia overall with double-digit growth in China on the strength of both the retail fueling and process solutions businesses, whereas Engineered Systems and Refrigeration were down in Asia due to slower economic activity in the region. Let's go to the earnings bridges on slide 6. Starting on the top. Engineered Systems' adjusted segment EBITDA improved $5 million, largely driven by volume and productivity initiatives, more than offsetting headwinds from FX. Fluids' growth of $35 million, reflects a combination of robust growth, continued margin improvement in retail fueling and acquisitions. The $7 million decline at Refrigeration & Food Equipment reflects lower volumes for SWEP and slower activity in food retail. Going to the bottom chart. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations improved $29 million or 15%, primarily driven by higher segment earnings and lower corporate costs, partially offset by slightly higher taxes. Now on slide 7. Year-to-date free cash flow was $142 million, which is an improvement over last year in absolute terms and as a percent of revenue. The second quarter in particular compared favorable -- favorably at 8.5% of revenue versus 6% last year. Year-to-date strong top line growth was supported by working capital investment of $164 million, which we expect to convert to cash in the back half of the year, inventory built with volume increases in the quarter as well as in anticipation of a strong Q3. The third and fourth quarters are traditionally our strongest cash-generating quarters. Capital expenditures were $91 million year-to-date slightly below last year. We expect our CapEx to ramp up in the second half in line with seasonality of our cash flows and are still on pace to execute our previously guided organic growth investments in the year. Let me turn it back to Rich. Richard J. Tobin : Thanks, Brad. Let's move on to slide 9. Engineered Systems delivered top line organic growth of 1.7% largely driven by the industrial platform. As you can see in the bridge, incremental margin conversion on organic growth was over 100% in the quarter, driven by productivity gains and volume leverage. Despite the negative FX translation, adjusted segment margin increased 120 basis points. Our Printing & ID platform declined organically by 3%, driven by the expected slower activity in digital printing due to the ITMA trade show that happens every four years, where customers assess and review the latest technology before making investments. To put that impact in perspective, digital printing was down approximately 20% in revenue and 50% in earnings from the comparable quarter in a business that we forecast to grow double-digits in revenue for the full year. We are encouraged by the pipeline of orders coming out of the trade show, especially in our LaRio industrial printer line and expect the business to reaccelerate into the second half. Overall, the platform performed well in Europe, while Asia experienced continued slowing from Q1. Our industrial platform posted 5% organic growth. Our waste-handling business continued to deliver double-digit growth as demand remained strong for both traditional equipment and software, with software growing by over 20% driven by significant ramp in installations. Despite the difficult trading conditions in the general automotive space, our vehicle service business posted 2.4% growth offsetting the more challenging trading conditions in automotive OEM demand and negatively impacting DESTACO. MPG was down from the comparable quarter due to shipment timing, but exits Q2 with its highest order backlog in many years as demand conditions in the defense sector remain constructive. Going into Q3, bookings for Engineered Systems remained solid. Most businesses posted book-to-bill of around one with a notable exception of our waste-handling businesses where orders were slower versus high comps and record backlog in the comparable quarter. Overall, we enter the second half on solid footing for the segment largely driven by Printing & ID platform, which is accretive to consolidated margins. Moving on to the next slide. The Fluids segment posted strong organic growth of 7.5% for the quarter, with continued strength across all the businesses. Adjusted segment margin increased 410 basis points with incremental organic margin conversion of 50% driven by volume leverage, improved productivity and product mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 22.9%. Our pumps and process solution business had another excellent quarter posting organic growth of 7%. Demand remained robust for industrial pumps, rotating equipment components for natural gas compression and renewable energy and equipment for polymer pumps and filtration systems. Biopharma and thermal management markets continued to deliver double-digit growth during the quarter, as we ready for a significant capacity expansion in this business. Fueling and transport posted organic growth of 8% as demand remained robust across all geographies for both underground and aboveground equipment systems. EMV demand is forecast to continue to be choppy as all signs point to adoption trajectory continuing beyond 2020 at current activity levels. Margin conversion on volume was strong in the quarter, and we expect that trend to continue for the balance of the year as we track towards meeting the stated margin objectives in the Fueling Solutions business. Bookings in the segment grew 7% organically over the comparable period. The growth is broad-based with particular strength in our plastics and polymer equipment and biopharma businesses. In Refrigeration & Food Equipment, organic revenue was down 2.8% at adjusted EBIT margin of 15%. Demand for the margin-accretive SWEP heat exchanger business was down 6% in the quarter most notably in Asia. Activity in food retail was mixed with systems and service projects posting a decline year-over-year; while our door case product line food retail's largest posted double-digit growth in revenue and backlog as retailers restarted investing in-store formats and refurbishment. United Brands grew modestly despite a challenging comparison to the prior year as several large chain rollouts were shipped on orders booked last year. And Belvac revenue increased modestly however bookings were slow. The poor mix effect on margins driven by the reduction of heat exchanger and system shipments was further exacerbated by volume ramp costs in retail refrigeration, which struggled with supply chain constraints and labor availability at our principal production site in Richmond. While we are encouraged by the turnaround in demand in food retail for our core case and door products, it is absolutely clear that we need to deliver on our automation project to deliver on volume earnings conversion. Bookings in the segment were slower this quarter posting 10% organic decline, mainly due to lower activity in refrigeration systems businesses and can-making equipment. In Food Retail, recent customer wins versus this time last year give us confidence about the improved revenue outlook for the second half. Moving to slide 12. Slide 12 disaggregates the key sources of EPS accretion for the quarter. Dover continues to deliver on announced cost actions. Incremental margin for the quarter was at 21% and is expected to be the lowest percentage conversion for the year as a result of a negative mix effect on the high-margin Printing & Identification platform in this quarter. Moving on. We are reiterating our revenue guidance for Fluids and Engineering Systems based on order books and forecasted growth in Printing & ID, and have lowered Refrigeration & Food Equipment as we are cautious on Asia and systems demand in the second half. Overall, we are encouraged with the performance in the first half of the year. Organic growth is 5.5% with good margin conversion. We are executing well on productivity and cost initiatives. Demand remains supportive across most businesses, but visibility and sentiment remain cautious in some sectors. Despite the cautious macro environment, we are in control of a significant portion of our year-over-year profit change, and as such, we are tightening on our full year guidance range to $5.75 to $5.85 per share. Lastly as a note, we are targeting mid-September to host a Dover Day in Chicago, where we will provide an update on our progress on previously announced initiatives and a review of our portfolio strategy. We'll provide more information on that soon. So that's the presentation. Let's move on to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, all. Richard J. Tobin: Good morning, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Hey. First on kind of the product ID and printing businesses thanks for that color on kind of the ITMA effect. But can you give us now a little bit of additional color then on what orders ought to look like in Q3? Do we see a big order bump there? And I just wonder, if you can also expand the conversation about that segment to kind of the Markem-Imaje piece of the business also? Richard J. Tobin: Okay. Sure. If we were to normalize our revenue through the quarters, the effect of printing \u2013 of digital printing on the quarter was a little bit in excess of 0.5 point of organic growth. So, I mean, we knew this was coming \u2013 Brad Cerepak : For the total corporation. Richard J. Tobin: Yeah. For the total corporation that is not just the segment. Look, we knew this was coming. I can tell you that the feedback that we get in terms of orders in the pipeline is very encouraging. I think that we are very conservative of how we recognize bookings in that particular segment, but we're talking about two million euro \u2013 dollar pieces of equipment. So we wait until we have letters of credits in place and a variety of other things before we put them into backlog. I would expect that, we'll book a decent portion of that in Q3. But I can tell you that, we've already begun to ship in Q3 in that particular sector. So we're \u2013 that's why we're confident in terms of the bulk of margin impact on the segment in the second half. As it relates to MI in total, MI had a very good Q1. It was slightly slower in Q2 largely driven by Asia. They had another very good month another good month or quarter in Europe. Our full year expectations is for growth to come back modestly in MI, but margin accretion to be robust in the second half. Jeffrey Sprague : And as a second question, if I could. Just on Refrigeration. So your comment about recent customer wins sounds like it's a food comment not a refrigeration comment just to clarify that. But \u2013 Richard J. Tobin: That's a refrigeration comment, but go ahead. Jeffrey Sprague : So that is a refrigeration comment. So could you elaborate a little bit on that? And I guess the comment about struggling with the volume ramp-up, right? Your orders don't suggest there's a strong volume ramp-up, but obviously you're in kind of a seasonal period. Is that what you're suggesting just kind of normal seasonality there's a little bit of struggle? Or there's something else that \u2013 Richard J. Tobin: No. Look I think the way \u2013 what we have is \u2013 we have to separate this segment into its component parts, right? So let's put heat exchangers to the side for a moment. What we're saying is on the systems business of refrigeration that's been slow. So that is disproportionate amount of the decline in the bookings. The bookings on case and door on the other hand are up significantly and our production has ramped up significantly in case and door. Unfortunately, during the quarter that is \u2013 because of the labor intensity of that product line, a significant volume ramp comes at some cost that quite frankly we struggled with and coupled with that we had a supplier that went belly up in the middle of the transition. So I think overall it cost us approximately $4 million to $5 million in the quarter kind of let's call that frictional costs with the ramp-up. We will do better going forward from here. But at the end of the day, I think that, we're pleased with our ability to compete in the marketplace. We're pleased that the order volume is ramping in door and case. So retail refrigeration is actually moving up right now, but it's absolutely clear in order to change the profitability aspect of this business, we've got to get this automation complete. So we're kind of keeping two balls in the air where we're gaining market share in door and case. We like the way the business is moving. It's going to come at some cost, so we don't have a lot of significant margin accretion associated with that. We'll get some absolute profit increase on the volume. But the margin accretion, I think until we change how we run this business in terms of SKU management and commonality of component parts that's really what's going to trigger. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Richard J. Tobin: Okay. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Richard J. Tobin: Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Good execution in kind of an uncertain environment. On the product ID side, you mentioned bookings were down in Asia. Are you seeing anything in kind of the machine builder channel that is a bit more choppy than expected given that, there's a lot of cross-border kind of activity for those guys the small machine builders in the U.S. and Europe that are kind of selling into there that your products may kind of go along the same line with? Richard J. Tobin: Steve, I don't know that question. I'd have to go back to the guys and we'd have to see the segmentation of the individual markets that they sell into. Steve Tusa : Okay. Richard J. Tobin: I just think that overall... Steve Tusa : Would that still be a digital printing issue in Asia for that segment? Or was that seem to be more of a core \u2013 a common and kind of core MI into Asia? Richard Tobin : Yeah, it's more of a core MI into Asia. On the digital printing side in our particular space, which is at the top end of the market, the demand it looks very proactive for the next several years just in terms of the proportionality of -- versus ticket price of those machines. I think that's a timing issue. And as I mentioned before that's a business that we expect to grow revenues by double digits for the full year. So that side we're confident on as long as we can get the letters of credits and everything all lined up based on what we think the backlog is going to be. On the MI side it was a little bit choppy. So I don't think that -- I think that China was down 1% and I think that India was down a couple percentage points during the quarter. I think that that is a reflection of what's going on in China but I don't have any real color on the segmentation of their customers at MI in China. I'd have to get that. Steve Tusa : Okay. No problem. You're plenty busy so don't worry about it. On the price cost, the refrigeration business, which I would have thought needed to get a little more price to kind of offset the material inflation or tariff impacts you didn't get price in that segment. Was that kind of where you probably saw the biggest headwind from price cost? Or do you not really have a headwind from price cost this quarter? Richard Tobin : I'd have to go and disaggregate it, but I think on retail refrigeration it's probably neutral. Not counting the frictional cost because that's not -- that's cost self inflicted quite frankly. So I think we were probably neutral in retail refrigeration. I'd have to go take a look at the other segments. SWEP is a difficult one because it's euro-based, but it's got a lot of China exposures so we'd have to go get that sorted out with all their FX translation. Steve Tusa : Sorry, to give you a long to-d-list. Thanks a lot. Richard Tobin : Fair enough. No problem. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Andrew Obin : Just a question on free cash flow. I think you gave a fairly wide target for the year 8% to 12%. You seem to be running well ahead of last year. Where do you think you guys are going to come out within that range given the performance year-to-date? And other than CapEx any sort of big movements in working capital in the second half that we should be aware? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean I think that the working capital seasonality should hold, okay? So that's first and foremost. And then our target is to hit spot on in the middle of the range, which is exactly we did last year. We are running a little bit behind in CapEx versus our full year guidance, so I think that we're tracking probably to the lower end of the range on CapEx for the full year. But look that swing number versus the entire working capital changes, it's something but I don't think it's anything overall. At the end of the day it's what we said before. We can -- we're working on grinding down working capital as a percentage of revenue or increasing turns across the portfolio. But what's really going to swing it for us at the end of the day is what the second half growth rate looks like. If we reaccelerate in the second half of the year then the industrial inventory won't come down. If we don't then we would expect the same kind of liquidating, or liquidation profile that we showed you last year in Q4. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question on operations just inefficiency at Refrigeration & Food Equipment on ramp-up. Any of it relating to restructuring and operational changes that you guys are making? And just if you can provide us broader color, you've now been at Dover for a while. How do you feel about the runway for cost takeout going forward and ability to execute? And I appreciate that you have not provided any specific targets for next year, but just to give us a broader update. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Sure. The margin target that we gave for retail refrigeration at September, holds. That requires us to intervene on the production footprint. And as we've said before, that process is underway. But this is not just basically installing some equipment and that changes the business. The business is working on a fundamental change of how they run the business particularly as it relates to SKU management, commonality of components and a variety of other things, which allows for automation in the future. I think that when we announced the investment that we were going to make, we said it's kind of going to be a little bit of a chicken and egg because at the time we were at the bottom of the market in terms of the demand function for door and case. And now that market is coming back and we're going to have to run the business in it\u2019s more traditional labor intensive way until we get everything stood up. But we need to protect market share and we need to protect the amount of volume that we've got going into fundamentally changing the business. So at the end of the day, I'm not making any excuses for it. I think that we struggled with getting the available labor in the market with employment rates what they are. It's tough. And as I mentioned we had a supplier go belly up on us in the middle or the beginning of the quarter, which cost us some money. So I would expect that we improve over our performance in Q2 but really what's fundamentally going to change this business is changing basically how we manage our SKUs and how much labor content is in this process. Andrew Obin : Thanks. Richard Tobin : Yeah. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from John Inch of Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Good morning everybody. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. John Inch : Rich and Brad, if you were to sort of -- we talked about Asia and parts of selective implications of detraction. How much would you say Asia detracted overall from the results? Maybe if you look at it sequentially or however you'd like to characterize it. Obviously not a big company in Asia but still helpful I think to put that into a jumbled bucket. Richard Tobin : Well, I think that -- look I think that Brad mentioned in his comments what total translation impact was. So there's the FX component of Asia, which you can calculate right? So it's a percentage piece based on the geographic distribution out of the $7 million to $8 million of translation loss that we incurred in the quarter. So that's a piece. And then I think the quarter-over-quarter profit of MI is Asia-driven mostly, right? But I know that you can't see MI at end of the day, but you need to unpack it from the digital printing impact, but I gave you some color in terms of what that was. Brad Cerepak : Right. And then you have the offsets from retail fueling having a really good quarter. Richard J. Tobin: Yeah. Brad Cerepak : And continuing to have a good quarter in China. So if you pull all that together not having the exact data in front of me, I would say China down slightly in the revs, but earnings still remains positive for us. Richard J. Tobin: Yes. I mean, SWEP was $4 million, so somewhere between $4 million and $8 million probably in the quarter. John Inch : Okay. That's helpful. Rich, at the EPG, you alluded to the fact that you thought Dover might be perhaps one of the very few companies to benefit from these List three tariffs. Could you -- is there any way to expand a little bit on that? I got a few questions on that. Where exactly would that be benefiting you? And do you think that's sustainable with some market share opportunities? Like, how exactly is this playing out? Richard J. Tobin: Well, I mean, I think it's benefit just because of our participation in the markets with our critical components that our price cost versus tariffs has been positive, number one. Number two, you can read in the paper every day about people readdressing the supply chains and we are the beneficiary of that just because we're a component supplier that's levered largely to North American production. Conversely at the end of the day, I'm not -- I don't want to take this as a conflict I'm positive on tariffs. I think that it's just been -- we've been positioned appropriately, just because of the nature of our business so far. But to the extent that those tariffs cause a significant slowdown in Asia then as you can see from the results that we have here, then ultimately it becomes a little bit of a negative on our revenue streams in Asia. But on the North American side of the business, it had been positive both from a price realization point of view and a volume point of view. John Inch : Maybe just lastly, Fluids obviously put up another very strong broad-based quarter. I guess we can sort of think about things like biopharma doing well on a sustained basis. But maybe you can just talk to your conviction in the portfolio, which I realize has got some niche elements to it. The portfolio overall in Fluids being able to kind of ex compares still put up a cadence of robust growth against the backdrop of a global softening. How should we think about this do you think? Richard J. Tobin: Look. I mean, it is a collection of businesses and there's a variety of things going on, right? We've got a high-growth business that's sitting in with biopharma that's growing in high teens, let's call it and it has been for some period of time. So you've got a high growth and high margin, so you've got that portion of the portfolio. We think that we have a pumps franchise that is able to compete both macro growth and from a competitive point of view. So there is an element of share gain, despite the fact that those -- trying to calculate share gain in a very dispersed business is difficult. We believe that we're winning in the marketplace in that particular side. And on the Fluids side of the business, we've got a best-in-class underground franchise that is driven by regulatory growth and I would say that we're probably gaining market share. There also and most importantly as we had highlighted last year, I think that our aboveground business improved margins -- comparable margins by 400 basis points quarter-to-quarter. So basically, we are on track to meet what we said by exit this year. So you've got a high-growth element and then you've got some niche franchises. We are winning in the marketplace and you've got one big piece of the business that is improving their margins dramatically. John Inch : And is there a runway of deals to do in this space Rich that would meet your returns criteria and pricing and so forth? Richard J. Tobin: I hope so. John Inch : I guess, I'll hear more in September. Thank you very much. Appreciate that. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Rich, you mentioned that EPG that DFS would probably reach the bottom of the 15% to 17% margin range for the year. But you just kind of answered John's question and you kind of said that DFS nothing's on track. Obviously, a very strong incremental in the quarter. Did something change? Is it just that they're starting to get their act together there? I mean, you did better all year, but you did make those comments on EPG. Richard J. Tobin: Yes. Look I think that the range that we had for exit is 15% to 17%. I said, we were tracking towards the bottom. Can we beat it? Sure, we can. But let's walk through another quarter or so and see where we are. But I think that we're not out of the woods from a comp point of view before we get excited about the margin comparison, but I think the team is on it. And clearly, a 400 basis point accretion in the comparable quarter is great and it puts us on the trajectory to meet those exit numbers. The backlog is there, so it's supportive. At the end of the day that is a -- to me that is a midterm target for that particular business, because even at exit, when we comp it against the competition, we've got some room to go. But so far, so good and we're very pleased with the effort of that particular business to grind it out. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's great. And then last quarter Rich in ESG in particular, you mentioned that you had decent visibility into the business in Q3, but you needed another quarter under your belt to see how the business would fare for the year. So how are you thinking about ESG bookings and revenue growth in particular for the second half of the year? And what kind of visibility do you have at this point? Richard J. Tobin: Look we feel good about ESG for the year. So I think clearly that when we're looking for that business to slow down, we don't think it's going to this year. We're booked pretty much through the end of Q3. We're waiting on a few orders and backlogs. So hopefully by the time we do this again in another 90 days that the backlog will actually probably stay even to go up slightly, which would solidify the full year. We're very pleased with the growth that we're getting out of the software franchise, so we'd noted that. That particular piece of the business has grown 20%. And it's not margin accretive yet, because it's just on installs, but we expect the leverage on that to be significant going into 2020. Andrew Kaplowitz : Thanks guys. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe a first question around capital deployment. There was no buyback spend in the first six months of the year, a couple of small acquisitions and you closed on All-Flo Pump. So, maybe give us some update on at least for this year specifically how you're thinking about capital deployment. I understand we'll hear about the medium term in eight weeks' time. Richard Tobin : Well, I mean in general terms Julian it's basically what we said before all right? Our bias is for organic investment followed by inorganic investment going to capital return. I think that we've got a relatively robust pipeline on the inorganic side, so we'll keep our powder dry to see how that develops over the next few months. If we are unable to close on those, then we'll revisit the issue of capital return for sure. Julian Mitchell : I see. So, if we don't see a big step-up in M&A, we can expect more buybacks by year-end? Richard Tobin : At some point. I don't want to put a calendar on it. But at some point, we're not going to -- we have an expectation in terms of cash flow for the year. We're not going to sit on a significant pile of cash at negative carry for sure. We prefer to deploy it. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thank you. And then my follow-up would be just looking at the aggregate profitability in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, should we expect the profits in that division to be flattish year-on-year for 2019 as a whole? Or does the -- is that just dependent on the Richmond site productivity efforts? Richard Tobin : Our expectation is for revs and profits to be up year-over-year. Julian Mitchell : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. We've touched on a lot already, but I do want to pick up on the last question from Julian. The growth in Refrigeration & Food, we've got a slight down organic in the first half of the year. Backlog is pretty flat. We burned backlog in 2Q modestly. What is the degree of conviction in the second half moving to sort of a 3% 4% organic growth rate? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean look at the end of the day I think we moved the segment down by one point okay? I think that our conviction in food retail for growth is quite high. We actually missed from a calendarization point of view. In order of that we would've liked to have been able to book at the end of June, but can't book until you have the order at the end of the day. Brad Cerepak : That's coming in now. Richard Tobin : And so it's coming in now. So, again just to give you some color on bookings as we proceed into Q3, we're quite constructive there. For us it's the margin conversion issue in that particular segment. We've got some aspirations there. But as we said before, I think that we need to change the dynamic of that business in terms of working on SKU management and reducing the amount of labor content, but that -- the benefits of that don't come in until mid-2020. So, I think that overall we're pleased in terms of the demand dynamic for door and case. What's going on in the marketplace it's up to us to kind of maximize profitability out of it in the second half of the year. Nigel Coe : Thanks. That's great color. And then maybe just characterize what you're hearing from kind of your field organization your channel partners. And the spirit of the question really is that some of the distributors in the U.S. have been talking about change in customer behavior through June towards the end of last quarter. And you alluded to kind of lower end of the CapEx for the full year. And I'm wondering if maybe you're pulling back a little bit or dialing back a little bit on investment spend in the back half of the year because I think that was more backend loaded in your plans. Any color on that would be great. Richard Tobin : Yes, I'll start with the second and go back to the first. I think no we're not pulling back on CapEx. It's just -- as it always happens you've got aspirations to spend this money and then it takes time to actually deploy it because when you think about what we're doing with our new plant up in Minneapolis for CPC, by the time we work through getting building permits and a variety of other things, you're three months behind and then timing. So, I think that that capital will be deployed overall but I think it's probably -- a piece of it is going to slip into 2020 just because of capital timing at the end of the day. So, we're not pulling back on the aspirations. But -- and then again we did give a range and we're probably going to come out of the bottom of it now the way things look from a calendarization point of view. Well, with the amount -- with the different types of businesses that we have in the portfolio, you can imagine the plethora of mixed messaging that we get from the marketplace. I can just tell you as a general comment that the sentiment was more negative at the beginning of the quarter so -- than it was at the end of the quarter. We actually went through this issue that -- back in April that we were kind of worried a little bit about backlogs and a variety of other things and then we actually accelerated in the quarter in terms of both our own shipment performance and our backlog. So, it's a little bit of an odd situation that's going on out there in terms of what we're hearing from the marketplace and how that's developed into kind of our forecasting. I can just tell you that leaving the quarter based on; A, what's in our control and what we need to do to convert to get to the top end of the range if you look down at the squeeze, I think that we're in good shape. Nigel Coe : That's -- you're right that's a very odd environment. Well, thanks for the color Rich and good luck. Thanks. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning guys. Richard Tobin : Hey Scott. Scott Davis : I can't remember if you mentioned this at EPG or not but what were the return kind of hurdles that you crossed for this All-Flo Pump? Is it double-digit by year four or something like that? Or did you not mention that yet? Richard Tobin : It's 10% by year three. Scott Davis : 10% by year three. Okay. And then I have question. I covered your stock for a while and I don't know the answer to this. The environmental solutions business you mentioned software sales and I just can't recall what that is. Can you share your memory on what you're selling? Richard J. Tobin: Dover made an acquisition a couple of years ago called 3rd Eye. That guy was principally there for doing driver safety, but it's managed now to expand what it sells around that camera technology that is quite interesting. And the adoption rate over the last six months had some major independent carriers have been excellent. Scott Davis : Is that -- I mean, can you size that business? Is it big enough to move the needle? Richard J. Tobin: I hope so in the future. I can just tell you that off a relatively -- let me think about it in the context of ESG. Yes, I mean, it's big enough to move the needle over time. Scott Davis : Okay. And then just last question, just on portfolio and I imagine we'll get into this at Dover Day in mid-September, but are you reasonably happy with the portfolio you have now Rich? I mean, I know you've got some challenges in Refrigeration, but is this -- if we look out five years -- two years from now, is there likely to be further divestitures? Richard J. Tobin: Well I don't want to get ahead of our big presentation in September. Nothing in the portfolio is destroying capital at its present. But five years from now, is the portfolio going to look different than it is today? The answer is yes. Scott Davis : Okay. All right. We\u2019ll see you in September. Thanks guys. Richard J. Tobin: See you Scott. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from Mig Dobre of Baird. Mig Dobre : Yes, thanks and good morning. Just want to go back to your comments from about two minutes ago on just trends through the quarter. I mean, I understand your comments on Asia and maybe portions of the business in there being a little bit weaker, but it seems to me that everything else is trending pretty well. So I guess against this theme, if you would of macroeconomic uncertainty, can you kind of help us understand if there is anything that slowed maybe through the quarter, where was it? And if things maybe held better than what you anticipated at a point in time in April for instance, where did you get a little bit of upside? Richard J. Tobin: Well, I think in -- the entire Fluids segment is performing slightly better than we would expect it. I think on the topline and I think that we're pleased with the trajectory of the earnings for sure. We would have -- we did not expect the slowdown in heat exchangers demand during the second quarter, nor did we expect the FX. So, between those two, that probably cost us $7 million to $8 million in profit during the quarter. So those were unexpected. There's certain portions of the portfolio like the small exposure that we have to automotive OEM that we expected to slow and it did in fact slow during the quarter. But that we had modeled into our full year forecast at the end of last year in the first place. So, I think that we would have not forecast the frictional cost in Richmond due to the fact of labor unavailability and a supplier issue that we had. DDP as we've beaten that to death, we expected that in the quarter, so that's not a surprise. I think that the heat exchanger business and the FX translation is the two areas that when we take a look at what we had forecast at kind of the beginning of the quarter and versus the other quarter where we are. We would've liked to do better a little bit on the backlog. And as I mentioned before, we were -- we had a couple orders coming that we would've liked to get in June. I can tell you just as some further color on the DDP side, I mean we did that trade show and if you go back and look at my comments, I think that we're really pleased with the feedback that we have, but we didn't book anything in Q2 in DDP. So, to the extent that we can convert that interest into bookings in Q3, we would expect to see a good bounce back there. Mig Dobre : All right. That's helpful. And then, maybe for my follow-up, I saw last night you announced the partnership with ABB for Dover Fueling. So, maybe you can give us some thoughts here as to what the revenue model might be, the growth opportunity, how do you see the retrofit of existing infrastructure? What's the game plan? Richard J. Tobin: Well look, I can't monetize it for you right now. We just signed it yesterday. But in effect, we've always said that, we recognize the fact that EV chargers, there's going to be somewhat of a future on that. We can all debate what the size of that is. But, we've signed a Europe contract with ABB where we'd be purchasing chargers for resell into both our distribution and direct customer network and then we'd be moving to purchasing kits that would be incorporated into our dispenser factor over time and spare parts. So too early to start to say size and scale, but I think it was important that we develop partnerships because we're very attractive to manufacturers of charging stations because of the size and access that we have to distribution network and our OEM customers. Mig Dobre : Do you -- last question. Do you foresee having the need to make any sort of changes to the way you operate or go to market or really anything in order to be able to capture on this opportunity? Or is it just with your install base for lack of a better term in terms of operation? Richard J. Tobin: The latter. Mig Dobre : All right. Thank you. Richard J. Tobin: You're welcome. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : All right. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey. Maybe just touching on the rightsizing benefits for a second. Obviously, you guys have executed well in that regard and I think we're -- you've had about a $0.30 benefit so far this year. It seems like we're probably going to be through most of it, I guess, as we get into 3Q. And so, as you kind of think about the composition of your guidance into the second half of the year, how are you thinking about the importance of getting a little bit better leverage out of your organic volumes in order to hit your guidance and what are kind of puts the takes there? Richard Tobin : Yes. No, I got you. We knew that was a question. If you go back and look at my comments, we said that the margin conversion in Q2 is likely to be the lowest for Dover for the full year. So, if you go back and take a look at the side of the EPS impact of conversion, we would expect that conversion to go up in Q2 and -- I mean, Q3 and Q4 relative to Q2 and that the SG&A to slowly unwind. But I think that's all baked into what we believe that we need to do to reach the top end of our EPS guidance. Joe Ritchie : Got it. I mean \u2013 I'm sorry. Go ahead, Brad. Brad Cerepak : Yes. So, Rich is referring to the 21% on the chart. You see the 73% there with SG&A, but the 21% is going to improve in the back half. Joe Ritchie : Got it. And the biggest drivers of that, if I'm hearing you guys correctly, is going to come in RF&E and then potentially with digital printing picking back up in E&S? Or are there other moving parts? Richard Tobin : Well, I think, that we expect for -- clearly, for Engineering Systems driven by Printing & ID platform within Engineering Systems. I think that we're going to continue to have very good conversion in aboveground fueling systems on the margin side. And then, thirdly, it would be the RF&E, which, even when we continue to make strides in improving performance, is going to be dilutive to consolidated margins. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Yes, that makes sense. And then, maybe my quick follow-up here, I guess, just to make sure I understand the impact that ITMA had on the quarter, I think, you guys had roughly 50 basis points of growth to the whole portfolio, so, say, call it 100 to 150 on the actual segment. Is the right way to think about it then, call it, 2Q growth would've been more like 3% in the segment and maybe that's our starting point within expectation? Brad Cerepak : It is higher than that. Richard Tobin : Yes. We would have rounded up Joe. So -- but at the end of the day it would have been 3.5% or -- Brad Cerepak :  -- or 4%. Richard Tobin : Or slightly in excess of 3.5% to 4%. Brad Cerepak : Yes to 4%. Joe Ritchie : All right. I was talking specifically about in Engineered Systems, right? Brad Cerepak : Yes, that's what we were speaking about. Richard Tobin : Yes. Joe Ritchie : Okay. All right. Got it. And that's kind of like the starting point for 3Q and you guys would expect an improvement on that? Richard Tobin : Yes. Joe Ritchie : All right. That all -- Richard Tobin : Well, that would be kind of like the normalized in a business we expect to grow in excess of 10% for the full year. Joe Ritchie : Got you. Okay. I think I got it. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Good. Operator : Thank you. Your next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Richard Tobin : Hi. Deane Dray : Hey, just want to follow up on that last comment on digital printing. The idea here is purchasing managers were out of pocket, so there was no ordering. But when you talk about normalizing, did you launch any new products at the trade show that would create some incremental demand? Or is it the same product line and just a catch-up on orders? Richard Tobin : We did launch a product a Mini LaRio. And then we launched a couple of different software solutions and a bundling package of consumable products with a big printer. So we've launched a series of different things. But even if we had not launched anything, we would have had the same demand dynamic, because that's just the way -- the show only happens every four years. So everybody holds off until they see what's the latest launched products and what the pricing environment is and a variety of other things. But... Brad Cerepak : And if I go back to what Rich said, the order take was very good at that show, but we're not showing them in our bookings until we get the credit lined up with our customer base. You can imagine, we ship those all over the globe and we're very conscious of being paid for what we ship. So we line that up first. Deane Dray : Got it. And then, just a clarification on heat exchangers. That came up a number of times. The size of it, I think you said $4 million. But what do you attribute the slowdown or the falloff in demand? Was there any share loss? Is this trade uncertainty? But what would you point to there? Richard Tobin : Yes. I always shy away of any of our businesses having -- being a macro driver. What I can tell you is that it was mostly China and it was mostly non-refrigeration product line or HVAC. Brad Cerepak : Yes, non-HVAC. Richard Tobin : Non-HVAC product line, so industrial applications. Deane Dray : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Galiuk for closing remarks. Andrey Galiuk : Thank you. This concludes our conference call and we thank you for your interest in Dover and look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's second quarter 2019 Dover earnings conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Andrey Galiuk : Thanks, Stephanie. Good morning and welcome to Dover's third quarter 2019 earnings call. The audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for three months. Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today may contain forward-looking statements. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. With that, I would like to turn this call over to Rich. Richard J. Tobin: Thank you, Andrey. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us this morning's conference call. Let's get started on slide 3. Q3 organic revenue was up 6% for the quarter. The growth was broad-based across the portfolio and was positively impacted by improved production performance allowing us to ship product at a higher rate than Q3 last year particularly in the Fluids segment. Bookings in the quarter were solid with 7% organic growth with Fluids and Engineered Systems posting book-to-bill above one. Adjusted segment earnings increased 17% to $320 million contributing to 180 basis point improvement in operating margin over the comparable period. These results were driven by strong revenue conversion on volume leverage and continued improvements in productivity and cost controls more than offsetting unfavorable mix and labor cost inflation. Adjusted Q3 earnings were up 15% to $235 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60 a share was up 18% year-over-year. As mentioned during our investor meeting in September this is the last period, which we'll report under the legacy segment structure. Starting at Q4, we will report using the new structure and provide full year comparative data. Overall, we are encouraged with the results in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019. Our revenue has increased organically by 5.5% year-to-date and our rightsizing and operational actions are yielding robust margin improvement with resulting increase in comparative free cash flow. We are entering the last quarter of 2019 with a solid order backlog across all our businesses as well as strong momentum and execution towards our margin targets. And as a result we are tightening our full year adjusted EPS guidance to the top end of our range from $5.82 to $5.85 per share. I'll pass it over to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go through the details starting on slide 4. All-in revenue grew 4% to $1.8 billion and was driven by strong demand throughout our Fluids and Engineered Systems segments. GAAP EPS increased 33% to $1.40. Moving to non-GAAP results. As mentioned, we achieved significant margin accretion in the quarter with adjusted segment EBIT up 180 basis points over the prior year reflecting strong conversion on increased volume and continued execution of productivity initiatives. Adjusted segment EBITDA was $385 million, a margin of 21.1%. Key adjustments for non-GAAP results this quarter were acquisition-related amortization and rightsizing and other expenses. The EPS increase was supported by $0.04 or $5.2 million of discrete tax benefits, slightly below the $0.05 benefit in the prior year. Turning to slide 5. Let's get into a little bit more detail on our revenue and booking results in the quarter. As mentioned in our summary, organic growth was solid at 5.6% driven by Fluids and Engineered Systems and partially offset by Refrigeration & Food Equipment. As you can see foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our revenue and bookings. FX was 1.6% or a $29 million headwind for revenue, which had a $4 million impact on earnings with the most notable impact on our businesses levered to Europe and Asia. We expect these FX headwinds to persist in the fourth quarter. From an organic growth perspective Engineered Systems grew $42 million or approximately 6%, while Fluids grew $68 million or 10%. Refrigeration & Food Equipment revenue decreased by $12 million or 3%. Bookings increased organically 6.7%, and were \u2013 and all in were negatively impacted by FX. At Engineered Systems organic bookings increased $61 million, or approximately 9% driven by strong order intake in digital printing and the Environmental Solutions Group. Bookings in Fluids also increased $61 million, or 8% organically with strong growth in the fueling and transport and process solutions markets. Bookings in Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined $8 million. Finally, our book-to-bill finished at 0.99, while backlog at the end of Q3 was 3% higher than this time last year driven by Engineered Systems and Refrigeration & Food Equipment. From a geographic perspective the U.S. our largest market grew 7% organically driven by strong performance in Engineered Systems and Fluids, partially offset by Refrigeration & Food Equipment. Europe was up 8% with all segments posting organic growth and a particularly strong quarter from Fluids which was up nearly 20%. All of Asia grew 6% organically with China driving the growth at 20%. Our Fluids business was up 6% in Asia overall with nearly 30% growth in China on the strength of both retail fueling and process solutions businesses. Engineered Systems was up 10% in Asia whereas Refrigeration & Food Equipment was down mid-teens, primarily due to slower demand for heat exchangers in the region. Let's go to the earnings bridge now on Slide 6. Starting on the top. Engineered Systems adjusted segment EBITDA improved $17 million, largely driven by volume and productivity initiatives more than offsetting headwinds from FX. Fluids growth of $35 million reflects a combination of robust growth, continued margin improvement in retail fueling, and acquisitions. The $7 million decline in Refrigeration & Food Equipment reflects lower volumes for SWEP heat exchangers and slower activity in food retail. Going to the bottom chart. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations improved $31 million or 15%, primarily driven by higher segment earnings, partially offset by higher corporate costs and taxes. The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits is approximately 22% for 2019, 30 basis points higher than the prior year on a comparable basis. Now on Slide 7. Year-to-date free cash flow was $447 million, a $163 million improvement over last year. Our cash flow was strong in the third quarter at 16.7% of revenue versus 11.8% in the comparable prior period. Despite strong topline growth through the year, our focus on working capital efficiencies drove a net improvement year-over-year. As we turn our attention to the fourth quarter, given the uncertain macro environment, we will manage our production schedules to meet our cash flow objectives. The fourth quarter is traditionally our strongest cash flow quarter. Capital expenditures were $137 million year-to-date, slightly ahead of last year. While we expect our capital expenditures to ramp in the fourth quarter, we do expect several of our investments planned for 2019 to carry over into 2020. With that let me turn it back over to Rich. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks Brad. Let's move to the segment slides. Engineered Systems delivered topline organic growth of 6.3%, largely driven by our industrial platform. As you can see in the bridge incremental margin was strong exceeding 50% as we converted well on volume growth in digital printing and refuse trucks and have continued to gain efficiency across the businesses. Our Printing & ID platform grew organically by 4%, driven by activity in digital printing on the heels of a strong order pipeline coming out of the ITMA trade show in June. Overall, the platform has performed well with particular strength in Asia where increased shipments in digital printing more than offset the weaker demand environment from marking and coding in China. The industrial platform posted 8% organic growth. Our waste handling business continued to deliver double-digit growth as demand remained strong for both traditional equipment and software with digital solutions business growing over 50% year-over-year. Our vehicle service business posted 8% growth on stronger aftermarket demand in Europe which has been slow in the past few quarters. DESTACO continued to experience slow demand in automotive OEM and MPG was flat for the quarter due to timing of orders for a specific defense program, but continues to carry a significant backlog as demand conditions in the defense sector remain constructive. Bookings for Engineered Systems remained solid. All but two businesses posted book-to-bill above one with particular strength in digital printing and waste handling which booked several large orders replenishing at strong backlog. Overall, we entered the last quarter on solid footing for the segment, largely driven by Printing & ID platform which is accretive to consolidated margins. The Fluids segment posted strong organic growth of nearly 10% for the quarter with continued strength across all businesses. Adjusted segment margin increased 340 basis points with incremental margin in excess of 50%, driven by volume leverage and improved productivity more than offsetting negative geographic and product mix. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 24.2%. Our pumps and process solutions business had an excellent quarter posting organic growth of 9%. Maag had a strong third quarter deliveries in the plastics and polymer markets in Europe and Asia which were back-end loaded to Q4 in 2018. Biopharma and thermal management markets continued to deliver double-digit growth during the quarter. Shipments remained robust for our industrial pumps and precision components business despite the weakening macro demand environment. Fueling and transport posted organic growth of 11% as demand remained robust across all geographies for both underground and aboveground equipment systems with particular strength in China which is going through the final stages of its underground piping upgrade cycle. EMV demand in the U.S. improved sequentially, but remained choppy and was not a significant contributor to comparable growth. Bookings in the segment grew 8% organically over the comparable period. The macro environment has shown signs of slowing in some end markets, but we remain constructive as the segment enters Q4 with a backlog roughly flat year-over-year albeit more skewed towards longer term projects. Refrigeration & Food Equipment organic revenue was down 3% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.3%. The margins were pressured by lower volume and frictional costs as we continue to restructure our manufacturing footprint in this segment. Activity in food retail remained mixed. Systems and services projects continue to decline year-over-year as new store activity remains subdued. Our core case -- door case product line food retail's largest sustained double-digit growth in revenue and backlog as retailers continued investing in store remodels. SWEP posted a flat quarter on a rebound in European demand offset by continued weakness in demand for heat exchangers in Asia. Bookings in the segment declined 2% organically mainly due to lower activity in refrigeration systems business. We enter Q4 with two-thirds of revenue in the backlog for food retail business and a constructive outlook to book shipments against several large contracts we signed last quarter. SWEP and Belvac enter Q4 with an increase in comparative backlog. Moving to slide 12. Slide 12 disaggregates the key sources of EPS accretion this quarter. Solid growth and operational actions continue to yield strong results driving the majority of the 18% EPS growth. Incremental conversion of the margin for the quarter was 60%. We are reiterating our revenue guidance for Engineered Systems and tightening upward the guidance for Fluids. Recall Fluids posted 17% organic growth in Q4 of 2018, setting a high watermark for comparable -- for the comparable period this year. We expect Refrigeration & Food Equipment to post flat revenue in 2019 after an 8% decline in 2018 as the market stabilizes after resetting to remodel driven demand. Overall, we are encouraged with the performance so far this year as we continue to deliver robust organic growth and margin conversion. We are executing well on productivity and cost initiatives and are working closely with our customers to sustain growth. Demand conditions remain constructive across most businesses but visibility and sentiment are cautious in some sectors. We have a lot on our plate between now and the end of the year with several major capital projects underway and an interesting inorganic pipeline but we remain focused on closing out 2019. So to wrap up despite the uncertain macro environment, a strengthening U.S. dollar and a challenging Q4 revenue comp, we are well-positioned to deliver a solid close to the year for both cash flow and earnings. And as such we are tightening our full year guidance to the top end of the range from $5.82 to $5.85 per share. And with, that let's move on to the Q&A. Andrey? Andrey Galiuk : Stephanie let's open the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Good morning Rich. Richard J. Tobin: Good morning, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hi, good morning everybody else. I landed at 3, last night. Sorry, I\u2019m still trying to wake up. Look, let me ask you a lot of -- sort of we got questions from investors on bookings. Those were very good. And given the tough comps in Q4; A, how much of one-time stuff did you have in the third quarter because it does seem that you were helped by the Printing & ID? I think some of the refrigeration bookings maybe happened that you got in second quarter, happened in third quarter sort of. So how much of one-time stuff did you have in 3Q in terms of robust bookings? And can you think you can deliver positive bookings in Q4? Richard J. Tobin: Well, I think that -- I don't want to comment on where we end up on Q4 bookings. We'd like to see that end. But I'll give you some color right? A lot of what we did in Q3 comparatively was based on production performance and to a certain extent order timing. So if you remember last year we were just coming out of a period in the Fluids segment where our backlog was high but that was driven by the fact that we were having trouble getting product out at this time last year. Our production performance in retail fueling was significantly better this year than it was last year, which both drove the revenue line and the margin delivery. In addition, to that in the Pumps and Process Solutions business, particularly in MAAG, we delivered basically our Q4 last year in Q3. So it was great to get the product out because these are our systems related in Q3 but that makes the Q4 comp even more difficult than even we would have estimated at the beginning of the year. The fact of the matter is if we got it out of production and it's ready to go let's ship it. In terms of backlog, I mean if you go back and look at the comments, the backlog is great. It sets us up well. But the fact of the matter is if you look in ESG, our backlog, a lot of that is flowing into 2020 as opposed to our ability to convert it into 2019 and especially so in MAAG and in precision components also. Those are longer-term systems contracts, which we're happy to have because we'd be shipping the next year. But I don't think that we're going to be able to convert them in Q4 just because of the long cycle nature of production. Andrew Obin : Thank you. And then the question on Refrigeration. What's happening to labor cost in Refrigeration? And any way of sizing the OpEx investment around the planned automation into 4Q and into 2020? Richard J. Tobin: The bigger issue in Refrigeration is not labor cost per se. It's labor availability that ends up rolling into over time, which ends up, so the labor cost net-net is up but it's -- the real struggle we're having is not the rate of labor cost, it's more of the availability. So running a bunch of overtime trying to get the product out and it is negatively impacting margins. But at the end of the day that is what we're hoping to resolve in the future by automating the process and taking a significant amount of the labor out. So if you looked at the P&L, labor costs will be up but it's not driven by rate. It's driven by the amount of OT that we're running. Andrew Obin : Rich, Brad you made it look easy this quarter. Thank you. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks. Andrew Obin : Congratulations. Brad Cerepak : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Good morning everybody. Richard J. Tobin: Good morning, John. John Inch : So Fluids, I think if I look at your guide, right for organic revenues for the year, it implies the core down high single digit. Rich, you went through some of that based on the timing MAAG pull forward and so forth. Is that it? Or is there something else -- firstly, am I kind of right about the down high single-digit core for Fluids in the fourth quarter? And is there something else going on that maybe could actually boost that business versus expectations today? Richard J. Tobin: Okay. Well look, I mean at the end of the day, I think that we've been trying to tell everybody all year that the comp in Q4 in the Fluids segment was going to be tough because we grew 17% in Q4 last year. I think, it's going to be interesting when we go to the new segments because, when you look at bookings and revenue, you've got really two different kinds of businesses in there kind of like short-cycle demand which would be fueling systems and then you've got kind of long-cycle demand. And what we have going on is, backlog is up, but it's biased toward longer-term demand which is DPC and MAAG because those are longer-term projects. This is not to say that the above -- that fueling solutions is going to have a bad fourth quarter, but the fact of the matter is that we've known all along, that we shipped a lot last year because we had a self-induced backlog and not being able to get the product out. And we've done a much better job in terms of production performance this year, which is reflected in the margins. So, there's really nothing going on so to speak other than timing differences on production performance. John Inch : Well, so, I guess part of the issue is that we're going to have tough compares into -- literally through the first three quarters of next year too. All else equal, does that prospectively subdue growth similarly and I realize there were some kind of one timer\u2019s right in the fourth quarter. Richard J. Tobin: Look, if I look at estimates for topline growth for '20 today and we haven't given out any guidance for '20, but if I look at it, I don't think that we will have an issue based on our backlog right now. John Inch : Got it. Richard J. Tobin: But clearly -- and I've read a bunch of the research reports, this notion of us kind of missing Q4. Well, we just beat Q3, so the assumption is you've got to moderate Q4. And we've been pretty clear that the topline was going to be a tough comp for Fluids in Q4. John Inch : No, that's clear. The RF&E segment, so I mean it didn't show sequential improvement, so it deteriorated on the margins sequentially. I think you sort of explained that. The question is -- and I think the automation stuff obviously picks that back. Do you still see a path Rich to 15% to 16% margins in retail refrigeration that you outlined in the... Richard J. Tobin: I do. I do. Look, we're in the midst of consolidating on UB's platform which is causing some consternation in terms of getting the product out and some transitional costs because we're going from five to three in terms of the footprint. And we are throwing labor right now at increased volumes in door case and it's costing us some money to do that. But I think we should have some good news in terms of backlog based on what I can see in door case leading to Q4, despite the fact that Q4, the seasonality is usually one of the worst quarters. But I think we're lining up to have some good news in terms of bookings at least going into '20. John Inch : Just last, given the choppy economy, did you see -- like how did the third quarter play out for you? Traditionally, September is a very strong month right for most industrial companies. Were there anomalies as you went through July, August and as you ended September and October? Richard J. Tobin: I think that there is an amount of caution that's out there especially through distribution about everybody trying to manage their inventories through the end of the year. I think that we performed in the Fluids segment better than we expected, especially on the underground side and that -- because of this transition with the regulatory environment on the piping, so I think the guys did a fantastic job of getting the product out, but that's kind of pulling away from Q4 to a certain extent. And we knew that that was going to slow into '20. So, we're maximizing performance, but clearly the market sentiment is not as good as it was this time last year. John Inch : It's refreshing to hear a company not managing quarters, but actually just getting the stuff shipped. Very much appreciated. Thank you. Richard J. Tobin: You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey good morning guys. Richard J. Tobin: Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Rich, so food margins have continued to rise. And you talked at the Analyst Day that fueling solutions continues to be a near-term opportunity for margin enhancement. Are you basically at the point now through restructuring that you got to the 15% to 17% margin in DFS? And as you've gone through it, have you found incremental margin opportunities? Or are the strong incrementals in that business really just a function of the strong growth that you've had? Richard J. Tobin: Well there's two pieces to it, right? I think that when we referred to the margin catch-up opportunity, that was on the aboveground portion of fueling solutions. And I think if you -- we don't disclose that number, but I can tell you that that is where a significant amount of the year-over-year margin accretion has come from. So the team has done a really good job in terms of executing on that. On the belowground side, that's just pure volume, right? I think that we've had arguably leading margins in the belowground side and they've been executing well. And I believe that we've gained market share in that particular segment. So, I don't think that we've extracted everything that we can from the aboveground portion. I think that -- as I mentioned back in September, I think that we need to improve our margins in the EMEA region. But overall, I think that we're reasonably pleased, but we don't feel that we're at the end of the runway. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. And then, just talking regionally about your performance, obviously you just mentioned the underground inflection has had a regulation in China. But China was a bit weak for you last quarter. Obviously, very strong this quarter and Europe continues to be strong. So, maybe you can talk about those particular regions and what you see going forward. Did you see any stability for instance in businesses like MI in China? Or have they continued to weaken? Richard J. Tobin: I think that the rate of weakening in MI is relatively static to last quarter, okay. So it didn't get any worse and it didn't get any better. I think that we performed well better than expected in Fluids on the underground portfolio of fueling solutions and that may be a little bit of a pull forward. EMEA, for us, as you know, is always a messy number, because we've got some substantial businesses there that export a lot. We do our best of trying to recognize revenue, but you've got a business like digital printing, for example, that had an excellent quarter, as we expected. That is -- 100% of that output is recognized in euros but it's exported around the globe. So our euro or our EMEA number is always -- it's more MEA than the E, if you follow me. Andrew Kaplowitz : Yeah. Thanks guys. Nice quarter. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Hey, just back on fueling Rich, I think you just said you got more runway there. Not surprised to hear that. But the improvement that we're seeing, would you call this still just kind of better operational execution among the business as it sits today? Or are we seeing kind of fruits of really trying to maybe better integrate OPW and Tokheim and Wayne and just thinking about what was rolled up in prior years and maybe wasn't really fully stitched together? Richard J. Tobin: More the former. Right? So I think a lot of it is some of the operational issues that we had last year have been -- not fully but a lot of that has been rectified. So when I referenced the issue of improved production performance Q-to-Q that's really what I'm talking about. I think that we've made a lot of initial progress in terms of the integration, but that's really a European phenomenon for the most part. And really that's what we need to continue to work on. I think that there's been a lot of work done on it in preparation for harmonization of platforms between Wayne and Tokheim in Europe, but I don't think we're really seeing the benefit of that yet. That's to come. Jeff Sprague : And you said that EMV did not contribute to growth. Does that mean it didn't grow? Or it didn't grow at a different growth rate than the segment? Richard J. Tobin: It grew, but it did not materially impact the growth rate in Q3. Jeff Sprague : And just one last one, cases versus doors. Were you saying just doors were up double-digit? I didn't really catch that. Richard J. Tobin: No. It's an integrated offering now almost. It's door case. Jeff Sprague : Yes. Okay. Up double digit in the quarter? Richard J. Tobin: Yes. Jeff Sprague : Okay. Thank you. Richard J. Tobin: Welcome. Operator : Your next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Richard J. Tobin: Good morning Brad Cerepak : Good morning Nigel Coe : So, great, so free cash flow in the quarter. And obviously free cash is being a little bit lumpy. You've got strong growth no surprise there. But Brad you called out the seasonality impact in 4Q. Normally 4Q cash flow is higher. Number one, do you feel comfortable that you can grow free cash flow sequentially from what you did in 3Q? And therefore, I'll be pushing towards the upper end of the range in terms of the free cash margin guidance. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Okay. Well, quite frankly, we're pleased with the execution here in Q3. And also, I think, it's the first time we're actually calling out that we've made progress on our working capital, which is great to see. We're continuing that -- those actions into the fourth quarter. The thing we did point out and we continue to say is, that this is going to be a more heavily invested year, which means we're set up to have a stronger CapEx spend in the fourth quarter. Having said that, I still see that into the fourth quarter and we'll be delivering strong cash again year-over-year. So we feel confident about our cash flow for the year. Nigel Coe : Okay. I think that's good enough. And then just \u2013 obviously, most of the metrics came in extremely strong. If I had to be critical, gross margin conversion was not a great quarter if I sort of like sort of dig into kind of what needs to improve. So maybe just unpack gross margins and the \u2013 that decline, I think, it was year-over-year. Kind of what impacted that maybe price/cost mix? And then, Rich, what improves in 2020 in terms of getting that gross margin converted better? Richard J. Tobin: It was mix more than anything else. If we unpack it between kind of input cost headwinds and labor inflation versus price, we're better than \u2013 in tariffs, we're better than neutral. It's really mix at the end of the day. And mix you can't control. I mean, if you look at -- let's pick one, like a company like VSG that posted an excellent top line growth, but the gross margin was down some. It's all mix related, but that's something over time that we think that we can rectify, because it's a specific product line that's kind of ramping up and we're dealing with some of the costs associated with that. So there's a lot of different initiatives that were going \u2013 that are going on and will take some negative mix. It's not price driven. We're not buying market share, but it's kind of some transitory issues in terms of building up new product lines and the like. And if you look at the geographic mix of our revenue, let's go back to the questions I talked about before and we would be pretty upfront that Fueling Solutions' EMEA margins are negative to consolidated margins and they had a pretty good quarter. So we'll take the revenue and we'll take the absolute earnings, but it comes out as a negative -- as in the negative mix. So the mix we can't really control. I think that we're trying to be disciplined in terms of pricing and a variety of other things. But you don't want to shut off the top line trying to manage gross margin. Nigel Coe : Absolutely. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Thanks a lot. Good morning. Just wanted to ask a first question around Refrigeration & Food Equipment demand, not so much around door versus case or door case bookings in Q3 versus Q4, or whatever. But just last year, as you said, organic sales down 8%. This year maybe flat \u2013 flattish let's say. How do you think about the overall customer spending environment? Maybe be for 2020 or even for the medium term, do you really think this is a floor in sales for that segment? And where you think we are on the sort of replacement cycle for customers? Richard J. Tobin: I think that the market is transitioning the way that we expected it, meaning that it's now driven towards repair, refurbishment which is good. And that's what's driving the door case portion of the volume. I think the greenfield build-out has continued to be weak, so it's a negative to systems. So systems from here, it's hard to say. I mean, it's how one is a piece of a string. It's pretty damn low in terms of the demand right now, because we don't see a lot of big box greenfield expansion going out there. But we are getting slightly encouraged at least in terms of the door case demand, which is the bulk of the business and that's the part that we're intervening on in terms of its cost structure. So we feel -- based on what we can see right now and as I alluded to during -- earlier in the call, I think that we should hopefully have some good news about bookings and door case closed in Q4, which sets up 2020 better than 2019 on the systems side. I would hope that we're at the floor right now. Julian Mitchell : And if you think about what that means for margins, I mean, this year in Refrigeration & Food you've got flattish sales, margins down slightly probably for the year. If you had flattish sales in 2020, do we think the margin performance can be better? Richard J. Tobin: I hope so. I mean a lot of that is going to be predicated on how we execute on the startup of our automation on the Hillphoenix side of the business. So I would expect that we're going to have some hiccups in Q1 and Q2. I mean, it's a pretty big project, but I think overall I think that we can post increased margins that we're expecting to -- post increased margins on the top line next year. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then just my second and last topic would be around capital deployment. Buyback spend in the nine-month period I think $23 million so very, very low. I think in the prepared remarks you've mentioned some attractive M&A opportunities. Maybe just flesh out how you're thinking about that and whether there are a lot of opportunities that you can still do at that 10% year three rolling hurdle rate. Richard J. Tobin: Well, it's interesting. I think that the amount of opportunities has increased significantly over the last let's say six months, but the pricing environment is still tough. We lost out on one in Q3 that we would've liked to execute it, but the purchase price just got -- we got bid out at the end of the day. But having said that, I think that we've got a better -- a much better pipeline than we did last year, remains to be seen if we can have a meeting of the minds in terms of valuation and get them done. So I think that we feel good that based just on the number of attractive opportunities that you'll see some increased activity there. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning guys. Richard J. Tobin: Hey, Scott. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Scott Davis : Richard has there been any real change in the M&A processes? Kind of how you guys -- whether the bodies or the process or the filters or anything that you're doing differently since you came on board? Richard J. Tobin: I guess that's hard for me to say. It's been the same for the 1.5 years that I've been here and I've never retrospectively looked back at the processes in the past, but I think that we've got a pretty robust process for it right now. We walk away from quite a bit unfortunately considering the pricing environment. So we got to have the discipline. Like I just mentioned we spent a lot of time and money on one that we just lost out on due to valuation in the quarter and that's life sometimes. So I can't speak to the past of the process. I can just say that we are confident in the team that we have here that is objectively evaluating these businesses. Scott Davis : And just to follow-up on that, I mean, where are the lion's share of your opportunities come from? Are they books that are out there? Are they -- the sponsor stuff? Is it stuff that you guys are internally cultivating or a combination of all? Just\u2026 Richard J. Tobin: It's a combination of all. It's a combination of all. Scott Davis : Fair enough. Thank you guys. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Pat Baumann : Oh, hi. Good morning guys. This is actually Pat Baumann on for Steve Tusa. Thanks for taking my call. A question and I missed it at the very beginning part of the call so I apologize if this is repetitive. But as you look at the segment guidance for organic growth and you look at the year-to-date numbers, it just seems like Fluids the exit rate is going to be at least for the guide maybe just conservative. But just curious it looks like it's going to trend down high single-digits or so in the fourth quarter. Is that just comps timing? Like how would you kind of characterize that? First of all is that the right read in terms of guide? Richard J. Tobin: No. It's correct and it's what we've been guiding all year that we grew 17% on the top line Q4 last year that there was no way we were going to do that again, because that 17% growth was timing of shipments in our process solution group that some of which that we recognized in Q3 so that business will grow year-over-year. It's just a timing issue. And the fact of the matter and in fueling solutions we had a self-induced backlog of our inability to get the product out last year, which we've done much a better job this year. So our revenue growth has been more evenly blended. So it's going to be a difficult comp. I think the headline figure is going to be what it is, but I think that we're confident that we can increase absolute earnings quarter-over-quarter despite that difficult top line comp. Pat Baumann : Understood. And then in the context of what looks like a tough comp to start next year there? Or do you expect kind of next year start out slower than ultimately ends just given those comps? Richard J. Tobin: I don't want to get into -- look we haven't given that guidance for next year and I'm not going to give out sequential guidance for next year. So let's wait until we close the year, we can deal with seasonality of 2020. Pat Baumann : Okay. Make sense. And then just my second follow-up would be, just in terms of the incremental cost savings expected for 2020 could you remind us what the total number of the incremental cost savings number -- I wouldn't think that that's changed but just remind us what that is. And then... Richard J. Tobin: You mean the famous $50 million? I knew, we'd finally got a question. Congratulations Pat. Yes, it's $50 million. Pat Baumann : So, $50 million. And then should -- like I know you don't want to guide for next year, but you gave that number. So just curious, if we should be thinking about that weighted to 1.5 of the year versus the other... Richard J. Tobin: You can't stop yourself with the seasonality can you? All right. $50 million is all you've got. Thanks Pat. Pat Baumann : Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Just a follow-up on kind of the core margin conversion this quarter, Rich, and I think in some of the past quarters you tried to isolate what was the self-help what was kind of the core conversion. Earlier in the year, I think you would've said core conversion could have been better. Obviously the 60% is a very good all-in number. Just wondering how you kind of grade those different pieces in the quarter. Richard J. Tobin: It's better and it continues to get better as we've gone through there. Mix aside and a variety of -- just take the noise out of the numbers, it's getting better. And a lot of that is based on improved production performance year-over-year. Now the reason that we stopped disaggregating it is because we said that we were going to do it for a year and the SG&A line especially because of FX movement is now getting really messy, right, because you've got headwinds on profit translation which is offset by kind of core cost on currency which positively impacts in our case the SG&A line. So it looks like we're overcooking SG&A now. We knew this was coming as we watched FX develop through the year. So overall, look we're never completely satisfied. I think that we've been open about where we need to improve next year. But overall, I think the gross margin conversion or the operating conversion we feel good about. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then I know you made mention to it a few times on some of the various moving pieces on revenue timing. Any way to kind of size the totality of the revenue that might have been pulled forward for the fourth quarter? Just for the sake of confusion so no one kind of gets that number wrong? Richard J. Tobin: Yes. We knew -- you can imagine as we were closing this quarter and we knew that we were going to be explaining this Q4 squeeze when we actually beat our own internal estimates for Q3 revenue in Fluids and only became -- made the problem harder. The fact of the matter is, especially as it relates to process solutions to the extent that the product is ready and we can ship it. We'd be crazy not get it out of the door and try to manage the Q4 number. So it's pumps and processes solution, especially Maag had an excellent Q4 last year. We recognize that in Q3 and I think that we've beaten this whole Fluids issue between the bad comp that was self-induced last year on the aboveground and the fact that we performed very well in Q3 in China, in Q3 and we would not expect that to do that again in Q4 on the underground side. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it, that's helpful. And then just one minor one, anything that you saw, on more of the pumps side of Fluids that matched some of this kind of macro agita out there? It doesn't really seem like it. But given that it's longer cycle maybe it's not something that's apparent in the numbers? Richard J. Tobin: Yes. I think that the longer-cycle systems business continued to book well for us. I think on the pumps business, we saw some weakening at the end of Q3 going into Q4. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it appreciate the color. Good quarter guys. Operator : Your next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks good morning guys. So we've talked about the 4Q guide to some extent on the Fluids it implied 4Q organic for Fluids. Maybe just thinking about Refrigeration & Food Equipment, it seems like the flattish guide for the year implies about mid-single-digit growth in 4Q. And so just curious just how much of that you already have in your backlog versus meeting short cycle to get better in order to hit that number. Richard J. Tobin: I would think that we've got the majority of it in backlog. Joe Ritchie : Okay. All right. Good enough. And then I guess maybe kind of thinking about next year and clearly on the fueling and transport side, you guys have been great regionally but very specifically in China you mentioned an upgrade cycle coming to an end. I guess how do you think about the growth rate in China on the fueling side of the business next year? And is there a headwind that we should be aware of as we're thinking about our own planning for 2020? Richard J. Tobin: Yes. We think that the belowground portion has got a headwind specifically in China because of the runoff of the regulatory environment. We're working on plans to make it up in other regions at the end of the day. But clearly on the underground side, we would expect that to be a headwind going into next year. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Is your expectation at this point that China overall on the fueling side is still growth next year? Richard J. Tobin: I hope so, but I think it's a little too early to tell whether -- what the quantum of the underground side versus the catch-up on the aboveground side. So let's -- we don't know yet but that's kind of our planning. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Okay. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Hey Rich you've used this term improved production performance multiple times over this call and I would love to hear more specifically around that. What are you doing differently especially in Fluids now versus last year? Is it automation you've added? Did you take out bottlenecks, streamline SKUs? Just give us some color for like what changed that -- in totality is this characterization of improved production performance? Richard J. Tobin: I think that arguably year-to-date 2019 that the Fluids -- or our fluid solutions group has done the best year-over-year improvement in operations, meaning I think that we were pretty upfront last year that we were struggling with the planned consolidation in Europe that need to be rectified. And to a certain extent we were struggling, not struggling but we felt we had room to improve with our North American operations and both have improved year-over-year. So that's what it is. It's \u2013 so it's \u2013 there's no frictional cost, not a lot of overtime. We're basically \u2013 it's manifesting itself in reductions in working capital terms. A variety of different ways that we measure the performance. So it's helped us. It's part and parcel to the year-over-year revenue growth because we had the same backlog last year. We're just getting it out in a more sustained fashion this year and not squeezing it into Q4 which happened. So it's that more than re-platforming. I think that the group is doing a lot of good work on re-platforming but that's a benefit I would expect that we see in the future. Deane Dray : That's great. And then just as a follow-up on the geographies, I'm trying to figure out which is more impressive, the fact that you had all segments growing in Europe, considering some of the anxiety we've seen in slowing there or China being up 20%. Just start with Europe, the balance of the segment growth there and in terms of recent weakness that we've seen in those geographies. Richard J. Tobin: As I mentioned earlier, we continue to perform well in Europe. And almost inexplicably, I mean, I think I wrote that into our comments despite the bad macros and everything else. But remember too that it is an EMEA comment. It's not necessarily what we would consider the old Western Europe, right? And there are headwinds there. We run through headwinds in both DESTACO and to a certain extent VSG on our auto OEM European auto OEM volume that we've offset and we've made a lot of that up on Printing & ID that are shipping into greater EMEA. So it's not like a lot of that product is being shipped into Germany per se. A lot of it is being shipped into the Middle East and Africa. So overall I think there's some timing differences on VSG. I think that Europe was actually up, off of two previous down quarters. And the balance of it is mostly in the Printing & ID segment and on the pumps on the biopharma side. Deane Dray : And then China, no sign of trade friction fallout? Richard J. Tobin: No. There's all kind of signs of trade friction fallout for sure. But at the end of the day I think that the Fluids group and digital printing offset weakness in pumps I think and MI in Markem-Imaje. Deane Dray : Very helpful. Thank you. Richard J. Tobin: You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your final question comes from Mig Dobre with Baird. Mig Dobre : Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the China Fluids discussion. Can you help size maybe the benefit that you've had from this pre-buy? I don't know how else to call it but ahead of regulatory changes. Richard J. Tobin: No. I can just tell you that our estimates for Q3, we did better than we would have thought in terms of timing. Whether we can squeeze out some more growth in Q4 it remains to be seen. But we consider it to be a headwind going into 2020 just because of the end of the transition. But I can't size it. Mig Dobre : I mean we're all wondering about the materiality of that specific business to the segment overall. Richard J. Tobin: No I get it. And it's \u2013 the good news for us is that we've got a variety of different \u2013 first of all, once we go to the new segment structure you're going to be able to unpack the long cycle portions of Fluids with the short cycle side. So we'll give you a lot more transparency there. So before you start taking the entire larger old segment and putting a total headwind on it of some percentage basis I would caution you, why don't you wait to Q4 and then you're going to see the split between the long cycle and the short cycle. Mig Dobre : Okay. And then lastly on ESG, we've seen some pretty good order volatility throughout the year. I think orders were down quite a bit in the first half. Obviously, you made up for it in the third quarter. What's sort of going on here? In terms of timing is there some specific product rollout? Is this just lumpiness from large customers? And what's kind of the setup going forward? Richard J. Tobin: It's the latter, right? So we recognize in that particular business that there are large high-value kind of blanket orders that come in from large customers that you've got to deal with the timing of the runoff. So part of the backlog positivity that we had this quarter is the fact that ESG is beginning to bring in orders for 2020 and that's reflected in our backlog. Mig Dobre : Okay, thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer period. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Galiuk for closing remarks. Andrey Galiuk : Thank you. This concludes our conference call. We thank you for your interest in Dover and look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's third quarter 2019 Dover earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on this morning's conference call. Let's get started on Slide 3 with key highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2019. Q4 revenue declined 1% organically due to a tough revenue comp of -- with Q4 of 2018 that we've been highlighting throughout the year. Overall, 2019 revenue growth was solid, up 4%, at the high end of our initial annual guidance, as 4 of our 5 segments delivered robust growth despite uncertain industrial macro and -- macro environment in some of our end markets and operating geographies. Bookings in the quarter were approximately flat year-over-year, posting a solid book-to-bill of 1.04. We are encouraged with the strength of our backlog, which stands at 8% higher than at the beginning of 2019 and is up in 4 out of our 5 segments, which we'll cover later in the presentation. Despite posting lower revenue, our earnings from continuous operations increased with margins in Q4 expanding 140 basis points, giving us confidence about our margin aspirations in 2020. We are forging ahead with our productivity and margin improvement efforts as outlined in our investor presentation in September. Adjusted Q4 earnings were up 7%, and for the full year, our earnings grew 15%. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.54 a share for Q4 and $5.93 for the full year, which represents a 19% increase year-over-year. Summing up, 2019 was another year of strong performance for Dover. We delivered industry-leading organic growth rates on the top line, expanded margins materially, improved our cash flow conversion metrics and continue to enhance the quality of the Dover portfolio through organic investments and 4 bolt-on acquisitions. On the back of a solid order backlog and continued momentum and execution of our margin improvement plans, we are announcing the full year adjusted EPS guidance of $6.20 to $6.40 a share. Let's move on to Slide 4 for more detail on the segment performance. Engineered Products segment had a solid finish to a strong year. Q4 growth was 3% and full year, 5%. Top line grew in the quarter on continued strong demand for our refuse collection vehicles as well as a continued double-digit growth in associated software. Our vehicle service business saw improvement in its European and OEM businesses, and we also introduced a new ADAS calibration digital offering, and we are excited about its growth prospects. Our MPG business grew in high single digits as it began shipping against a strong backlog built earlier in the year. Demand in our industrial winch and industrial automation businesses remains subdued as a result of cyclical weakness in industrial goods and automotive. Segment bookings in the fourth quarter were solid at a book-to-bill of 1.08 and resulting backlog higher than at the beginning of 2019. Our Q4 adjusted segment margin expanded 200 basis points on solid volume, product mix and productivity measures. Fueling Solutions finished strong and delivered a year of exemplary results. Full year growth was broad-based at 11%, and the segment delivered 320 basis point margin improvement, with the aboveground businesses exiting the year well into the target range of 15% to 17% that we had set forth in 2018. Demand remained healthy in Q4, yielding 5% growth for the segment and was particularly strong in North America where EMV compliance demand appears to be gaining momentum. Bookings in the segment were up 11% organically in Q4, providing a solid base for 2020. We have completed the integration of Belanger into our vehicle wash platform, and the business is on pace to meet or exceed our return on invested capital hurdle. Imaging & Identification declined 2% in the quarter and ended the year with 1% organic growth. Marking and coding activity was slow in Asia throughout the year, including in Q4, while other regions performed as expected. As you know, our digital textile printing business can be lumpy on the timing of orders and shipments and impacted by tariffs and financing availability in the Asian textile producing markets. A combination of these factors contributed to a slower Q4 in the textile industry activity, but we continue to work with a solid pipeline of prospective orders. Also, our digital printing workflow software is showing very good momentum with double-digit growth. Backlog for the segment is up 7% year-over-year. This segment expanded margin by 200 basis -- 270 basis points in Q4 and by 260 basis points for the full year despite slower top line, exemplifying our commitment to improve productivity, cost control and pricing discipline. Lastly, we recently closed the previously announced acquisition of Systech, a leading provider of traceability and brand protection software solutions primarily to global pharmaceutical manufacturers. This offering fits logically into our marking and coding portfolio and expands the share of software and service revenue within Markem-Imaje to over 15%. We are excited about the prospects of driving growth by expanding this offering into our high-value, fast-moving consumer goods customer portfolio.  Pumps and Process Solutions posted an 8% decline as the segment faced a tough comparable in Q4 as a result of Maag shipment timing and witnessed a steady slowing during the quarter in the industrial pump market where distributors were actively managed debt -- managing down inventory levels. Within the biopharma pumping connectors business, revenue continued its strong double-digit growth and carries a very strong backlog into the new year. We expect the biopharma business to continue its double-digit trajectory into 2020. With respect to DPC, our precision components business, activity slowed in what appears to be a temporary lull in the natural gas transportation infrastructure buildout, but we remain confident about its long term attractiveness. Despite the aforementioned order timing differences, Maag ended the year well and carries a strong backlog into 2020. Summing up, all the businesses in this segment posted organic growth in 2019, yielding a segment growth rate of 4%. The segment delivered an outstanding 310 basis point margin improvement for the full year. The segment is entering 2020 with a backlog that's 12% higher year-over-year, but we expect to get off to a slower start in industrial pumps and DPC in the first half. In Refrigeration & Food Equipment, it's been unmistakably a tough year for the segment with new food, retail store construction continuing to lag expectations and negatively impacting our systems and services businesses. This effect is partially offset by strong sales in the case product line that primarily serves store remodels, which continued to expand at a double-digit rate year-over-year, including on revenue, bookings and backlog. We have not stood still during this period with site consolidations in unified brands and factory automation and case set to contribute positively to earnings in 2020. Despite a challenging demand environment in 2019, our can forming and heat exchanger businesses returned to growth in Q4. Belvac's backlog has nearly doubled compared to the start of 2019. Overall, the segment enters 2020 on a positive note with a 19% higher backlog year-over-year. Our operational and productivity initiatives remain on track to start delivering results primarily in the second half of 2020. I'll pass it on to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's start going through the details on Slide 5. Rich has provided color on the growth dynamics by segment. I will point out that on top of the 1% organic revenue decline, FX continued to be a headwind in Q4, reducing top line by 1% or $20 million. We expect FX headwinds to subside in 2020. Acquisitions and dispositions, principally Belanger and Finder, contributed a $5 million net increase to revenue in the quarter. Bookings were flat organically and were similarly negatively impacted by FX and positively supported by acquisitions. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market, grew 4% organically for the full year with all businesses, except Refrigeration, posting solid growth. Europe was up 6% where all five segments posted organic growth in 2019. All of Asia grew 2% organically for the full year, while China posted 3% growth. Activity in Asia was mixed across our businesses. Strong regulatory and new build demand in the fueling and plastics and polymer markets were offset in part by slower demand in industrial heat exchangers and marking and coding. Latin America was slightly down for the year with a strong first half and a slower second half. Now to the earnings bridges on Slide 6. Starting at the top. Engineered Products' adjusted segment EBITDA improved $9 million, largely driven by volume and mix, more than offsetting headwinds from FX. Fueling Solutions' growth of $17 million reflects a combination of robust growth, continued margin improvement in retail fueling and in part, the acquisition of Belanger. Imaging & Identification grew $6 million on strong expanded margin despite lower volumes. The $6 million decline at Pumps & Process Solutions was driven by lower comparable volumes and was partially offset by stronger margins. Lastly, the decline of $7 million in Refrigeration & Food Equipment reflects lower volumes in the quarter. Going to the bottom of the chart. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations improved $15 million or 7%, primarily driven by higher segment earnings and lower interest and tax expenses, partially offset by higher corporate costs. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, is approximately 22% for 2019. Discrete tax benefits in the quarter were approximately $0.06 per share. Rightsizing and other costs were $18 million in the quarter or $14 million after tax, providing confidence on further reducing costs and increasing margins in 2020. In the quarter, we also refinanced debt due to mature in 2020 and in 2021, resulting in a $24 million loss on extinguishment or $18 million after tax. This loss is treated as an adjustment item to EPS in the quarter. The refinancing results in approximately $13 million lower interest expense on long-term debt in 2020. Now on Slide 7. We finished the year with very strong cash flow. Free cash flow for the year was $758 million or $140 million over last year, including a $16 million increase in capital expenditures. The free cash flow increase exceeded growth in earnings, reflecting improved working capital discipline and resulting in a more than 500 basis point improvement in cash flow conversion as a percent of adjusted earnings. As a percent of revenue, free cash flow was 10.6% for the year or 11.1% if we exclude cash restructuring expenses, both of which are above the midpoint of our annual guidance of 8% to 12%. Capital expenditures were $187 million for the year, slightly increased compared to last year, but below our original plan. While our major expansion projects remain on pace with our plan, timing of payments related to several large projects will spill over into 2020. Lastly, let's review Slide 8 with the EPS bridge. We finished the year with a strong 19% increase in earnings per share. This was driven by revenue growth conversion as well as margin improvement activities, resulting in revenue conversion margin well in excess of 100%. As you can see on the chart, the strength of the dollar in 2019 resulted in a negative FX impact of approximately 13% -- $0.13 of EPS, which we do not expect to reoccur in 2020. All in all, we can expect the same dynamic into 2020, a healthy conversion on revenue growth and operational savings, driving year-over-year EPS accretion. With that, I'll turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Brad. Let's take a look at the outlooks on Slide 9. We're entering the year with encouraging backlog and a constructive demand environment across the majority of our markets, allowing us to forecast organic growth of 2% to 3%, which I'll cover in detail on the next slide. Adjusted EPS is forecasted to be $6.20 to $6.40 a share as a result of solid revenue conversion and our previously announced cost savings initiatives. We expect earnings growth to modestly levered in the second half as a result of seasonality and timing of productivity measures. We expect another strong year of cash flow conversion of 85% to 90% of adjusted net earnings despite higher spending on capital investment. Engineered Products is expected to grow 3% to 5% organically on continued strength in waste handling, vehicle services and our aerospace and defense business. Fueling Solution is expected to have a slower 2020 compared to the strong past couple of years as the underground upgrade cycle in China rolls off. EMV activity in the U.S. has picked up, and we expect to gain better visibility in the next couple of quarters about potential upside here. Imaging & ID is expected to grow 2% to 3%, with the outlook largely dependent on conditions in Asia for both marking and coding and textile printing. Pumps and Process Solutions enters the year with a very strong backlog, and we expect it to grow 3% to 5% geared towards the second half. And finally, in -- Refrigeration & Food Equipment is expected to grow modestly in 2020. We are entering the year with a very strong backlog, but the trajectory of the past two years calls for caution early in the year. Overall, our multi-industrial portfolio with significant share of aftermarket component and service and software revenue is expected to deliver healthy growth in what continues to be an uncertain macro environment. Go to Slide 11. Dover's strategy is simple, but our aspirations are ambitious. We laid out key priorities in 2018 and are tracking very well, delivering against those. We plan to advance the same strategy further in 2020. First, you can see from the result of our rightsizing and operational improvement in our bottom line and our cash flow. We achieved target margin performance in our Fueling business. In 2020, we'll continue with the previously announced $50 million cost reduction program as well as our ongoing footprint and productivity programs in Dover food retail. Coupled with healthy growth in conversion, these actions will continue providing a margin accretion tailwind. Our business has sustained strong growth while taking costs out and working on the productivity, all under uncertain macro conditions. And our top priority in capital deployment is organic reinvestment. We initiated several growth and productivity capital projects and are starting investments in our can forming and heat exchanger businesses to capture growing volumes and upgrade competitive capabilities. Part of our SG&A reduction program was reinvested into various growth, R&D and digital initiatives, and we will continue investing in world-class digital and operational capabilities in 2020. Lastly, we committed to disciplined portfolio-enhancing M&A. Over the last 12 months, we have consummated four bolt-on, high-fit accretive proprietary transactions in the priority areas of our portfolio. The M&A pipeline remains active going into 2020. On a final note, I'd like to address the inevitable coronavirus questions as best I can at this early stage of developments. First and foremost, we have been in regular contact with our in-country employees and have issued policy guidance using our experience from the SARS time period. We have also put in appropriate travel policies company-wide. Our production sites had planned to be down from January 24 to 30 for Chinese New Year, but we expect to remain down through February 9 in most sites as a result of cantonal-enacted safety measures. In preparation for Chinese New Year, Dover and our supplier network had built inventory to cover this period as normal practice, but we are working closely with our global supply base on potential mitigation strategies actively. I would like to thank everybody at Dover for delivering a strong year and the hard work, setting us up for a good outlook of 2020. And that's it and hand it over to you, Andrey, for Q&A. Andrey Galiuk : Nicole, let's open the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Rich, in RF&E, obviously, strong backlog now leaving 2019. I think you said last quarter that good door and case bookings could give you more confidence that you're at the floor of the system side. So did the bookings plus the return to growth in beverage can and heat exchangers actually mean that you finally have good visibility into organic revenue growth in 2020? Richard Tobin : Well, I think on the can forming, for sure. And on the case side of the Refrigeration business, yes. On the systems and service portion, no because that tends to be relatively short cycle in terms of -- it really doesn't carry much of a backlog. So I think we feel pretty good about the case door backlog that we have going into the year. And I think that we feel good about Belvac, and I think that we feel reasonably good on SWEP on the heat exchangers. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on RF&E margin. You talked about the 15% margin as the exit run rate for 2020. So the good bookings in Q4 gives you a better shot of hitting that run rate? Is it still on track? And the margin in the quarter, obviously, you've talked about labor availability and overtime is an issue. I assume that's what it was again in the quarter, and that mitigates as you get the automation project online. Richard Tobin : It wasn't as much the labor issues that we've had. I think those moderated in case door production. I think that if we had any disappointment during the quarter was in unified brands. We had the orders. We could have shipped, but we're in the middle of doing a plant consolidation, and our performance has been a little bit lumpy there. So I think that we've got some of our labor issues behind us in case door, leading into automation. And I think that from what I've seen, at least at the beginning of this year, the unified brands has begun -- their shipment rates have gone back up. So I think we're okay there also. Andrew Kaplowitz : So you do think you could hit mid-teens as you go out to the end of the year here, Rich? Richard Tobin : Right, yes. I mean I think that our expectation is to exit at our target margin, Andy. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Just on the automation project itself, Rich. Can you just update us on just kind of what happens here in the next quarter or two? So you're starting to run beta and cut over? Like where is kind of the stress point on the organization to get this right? Richard Tobin : That organization has been under a lot of stress. But in this particular case, we will be building inventory for the transition through the first six months of the year. So I think it's going to be a little bit challenged from a working capital point of view. We'll be getting the beta units off within next month or so. And then our target is to -- the cutover of manufacturing on a single product line in approximately June. But as we mentioned before, we're not -- this automation project is not running inside the existing assembly operations of case door. So we don't expect to have any downtime associated with the start-up. It's just the costs associated with the start-up, including the working capital build. Jeffrey Sprague : And just thinking about the profitability in your backlog, right, I mean a lot of that will hinge on the execution in the factory. But as you've tried to kind of streamline the SKU count and the like, do you feel like you have kind of real visibility on the backlog profitability itself? And how much of a part is it -- is that to the kind of the exit rate that you're talking about for the year? Richard Tobin : I think that we've got better visibility than we have had, I guess, previously. I sell part and parcel to -- reaching our exit margins is some confidence in terms of what we have in the backlog and the margin that we should generate off of it. So it's not predicated completely on cost reduction as a result of labor content and assembly. Operator : The next question is from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. John Inch : So the 0% to 2% R&FE guide with SWEP and Belvac coming back, and Rich, you called out case and door strength, I mean, does that -- that obviously implies that the rest of that business is down. Is that business down getting better? Or are you just assuming it's down the way it's always been down? Or how should we think about it? Richard Tobin : I think that we -- well, we need to parse some of the pieces. But if you go back and listen -- when you read the transcript, I think that we are being cautious with that particular segment because the fact of the matter is it needs to demonstrate a couple of quarters of getting its feet under it. But I think that the part that we're going to wait and see mode is on the systems and service portion of the portfolio. We're confident that case door should be up year-over-year. We -- as I mentioned, we feel we feel good about SWEP and we feel good about Belvac and then we'll see. John Inch : The 5.4% margin this quarter, I mean, if you haven't been running these parallel systems and the automation project, where -- is there any way to get a sense of where that margin might have been if you haven't been doing this stuff? Richard Tobin : I guess there could be, but I don't have it in front of me, right? But there are -- there's a bunch of costs that we did take during the quarter that -- because of both the transitions largely in UB this time around that we could normalize, but I don't want to give out -- that's like -- well, if this didn't count, this is what our margin would be. I just can't give you an idea of what we expect it to be in 2020 without recasting the quarter. We're just going to have to take our lumps. We're not happy with the performance, but we think we've got some good line of sight on the non-Refrigeration portion of the portfolio, and it's up to us to deliver on the Refrigeration piece. John Inch : That's fair. Just lastly, Rich, I remember a conversation we had where you were pretty adamant, we're not going to chase industrial \"software\" deals and pay the big multiple some of these other companies have paid. And now you've done it, what appear to be a couple of pretty nice fit bolt-on software deals, I'm wondering how you're now thinking about this. Have you been able to find kind of a niche of some higher technology, higher value add without overpaying as you look at the portfolio and look to ramp up M&A going forward? Richard Tobin : I think that software, by its nature, the valuations, they're higher than kind of core industrial. And so it's not a -- but I think that my comment was more that we were not going to chase software damn the torpedoes, right? Brad Cerepak : We're an independent of our business. Richard Tobin : Independent of our business. So the software deals that we've done, our comp are highly complementary both to MI and to ESG. I think that we paid a fair price, but the fact of the matter is that software commands a higher multiple. Operator : The next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just following up on how you're thinking about the seasonality through the year. I think you had mentioned in Pumps and Process and Refrigeration & Food in particular quite a back-end loaded year. So I just wanted to check if you think Dover as a whole can be in that 2% to 3% organic sales growth range through each quarter and also whether that net $50 million of cost save, we should just spread out evenly through the year. Richard Tobin : Let's take the second question first. Yes, on the $50 million. To spread it evenly through the year, I think, is the safest bet. It's not incredibly material to the overall earnings. But I get it, it's material to the year-over-year projected change. Look, I think that I would -- I don't think it's going to be disproportionate in terms of the revenue growth. But clearly, we need to see where we are on pumps -- on industrial pumps in Q1. We know that Maag and DPC are going to be levered because those are bigger projects. So there's some caution in those two particular businesses. The upside is EMV, right? So if we take -- if we go back and take a look at Q4, I think we were a little bit disappointed in the demand. I think we had signaled that the industrial pumps was slowing at the end of Q3. It's slowed quite a bit, as you can see in Q4. So that was kind of a disappointment versus what our forecasts were. But we overdelivered to such an extent in EMV and kind of net neutralized where we were. On DF, I think that the earnings are back-end loaded, not necessarily the revenue because we've got some pretty healthy backlogs on Refrigeration. Julian Mitchell : And just my follow-up on capital deployment. In 2019, if I look at the cash you spent on buyback and M&A and CapEx, each of those three items were in that sort of $150-ish million to $200 million range rounding-wise. Just wondered when you're thinking about 2020, you can see the share count assumption you have pegged, you can see the CapEx range you have provided. But would we be surprised if that spread is broadly similar in 2020 as it was in '19? Richard Tobin : I think that the CapEx is our best estimate at this time. I think that we would prefer the weighting towards inorganic investment to go up and capital return to go down. But if we're not spending it on one side, then it's going to come back on the other side. Operator : Next, we have Andrew Obin with Bank of America. David Ridley-Lane: This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. What gives you confidence around the demand improving Pumps & Process Solutions as you go through 2020? I definitely heard your commentary that could be -- it could be softer here in the first half. Richard Tobin : Our biopharma business, we expect to again grow in double digits. I think that our caution is around industrial pumps. We have good backlogs on a project basis in Maag, so we feel good about that. And then DPC, we're betting on a little bit of return to growth largely in the second half. So I think we've got -- it's a glass half full scenario. We've got some backlogs on our project-related businesses that to the extent everything remains firm, we'll deliver on those. We're going to be a little bit cautious on industrial pump demand until we see and interact with our dealers a little bit about where they stand in their stocking levels and the like. So I think that, that gives us some confidence that the only risk that we're taking in terms of the growth is largely on the industrial pump side. David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And did the tone shift with customers around EMV upgrades? Is there a greater sense of urgency? And any updated thoughts on EMV demand after 2020 would be the question. Richard Tobin : Yes, 2020. I guess if we look at Q4, you could make an argument that the phasing of the demand could be pulled into 2020, but we don't have enough data. It allows us to say, let's move that number up in terms of how it extrapolates into revenue. But clearly, what's happening is, as you can read the newspaper every day, you're getting now the first instances of credit card fraud at retail operations. And once you have that, that kind of jolts a lot of people into action. So I think that's the phenomenon that we see. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So Rich, I just wanted to kind of follow up on the pumps outlook. Obviously, industrial pumps is the area of concern. How much backlog do you have kind of underwritten already for 2020 in that revenue growth outlook that you've got? And how does that compare to sort of a normal sort of backlog build into the fiscal year? Richard Tobin : Well, the absolute value of the new segment in terms of backlog is up, but that is weighted towards DPC and Maag, which tend to be project-driven, so we've got some line of sight on that. The industrial portion of the business outside of biopharma is flat, and that's also where the vast majority of the revenue stream goes through distribution. So as I mentioned earlier, we saw an amount of inventory management going into Q4. We need to see where we stand, and we need to get a quarter under our belt to kind of -- so I think that we're cautious about industrial -- on the industrial pump demand. But I think we think -- we feel good about biopharma and we feel good about Maag just based on the backlog. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. I mean it'd be also helpful if you've got any color on -- in terms of where distributor and channel inventories are right now. But I did want to touch on CapEx because it's just running at over $200 million, which is about 3% of sales. Typically, you've been running at 2%. And I think most of your multi-industry peers are in that 2% zone. I know you're investing. You just mentioned you've got a preference for internal investment. I'm just curious how long do you think CapEx remain at these levels and when do you see it dialing back. Richard Tobin : I think we're still spending on the brand-new site for our biopharma business that is going to roll off. So as Brad mentioned before, we underspent our guidance on CapEx. One of the reasons that we did was I think we underestimated how cold it is in Minneapolis to get that building stood up, so part of the spending has rolled into 2020. That, to me, is a one-timer, and we don't have anything like that. So we really have 2 or 3 really big projects running through our CapEx spending now. I think we highlighted them in 2018. Using round figures, in aggregate, that is close to between $90 million and $100 million of CapEx spend. We probably spent 60% -- 50% to 60% in 2019. We're going to roll forward to 40%. Unless we come up with another project that says -- for the brand-new building, based on growth, I would expect that amount of CapEx to come down as a percent of revenue. Operator : Next, we have a question from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Rich, just on Imaging & ID, I think the 2% to 3% seems like it would be similar to what would be in a normal year. I know maybe some persistent weakness in the fourth quarter that doesn't give you all the optimism in the world. But you're coming off some fairly easy comps. The business doesn't seem like it takes a long time to build momentum once it's generated. At what point in time could we start to see more momentum there? Are we kind of locked into a weak 1Q just based on your visibility? And from there, it becomes more of a macro call? Can you just kind of walk us through the phasing of what a better scenario would look like timing-wise? Richard Tobin : It's very Asia dependent. And just forget the recent news around Asia. Asia had slowed progressively in that particular sector. I'm talking about the Printing & ID portion of the business throughout 2019. So I think we're relatively cautious about expectation there, quite frankly, going into '20. We didn't make some deliveries that we thought we were going to make in digital printing in Q4 because of financing, letters of credit and the like. So part and parcel to that growth rate for '20 is somewhat levered on to the textile printing business because we believe that the orders are there. We just need to sort out some of the financing on it. So it's hard to say. I mean I think that's a question that we can probably answer at the end of Q1 once we see what's actually happening in Asia on the printing and ID side to say whether we're going to have an inflection point. Having said that, we've just invested in a complementary revenue stream for Markem-Imaje. So let's see what we can do with that going forward. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just taking a step back, obviously, a lot of focus the last couple of years on productivity, and 2020 certainly has a lot more with some of the investments you're making in CapEx and otherwise. Is 2020 a year where you can start to shift your gaze toward the portfolio, whether it's on the M&A side or examining maybe noncore pieces of the business? Or is this still going to be kind of like an eyes-down, productivity-focused year in its entirety? Richard Tobin : I'm sure the management team is not going to like when I say this, but the productivity issue never goes away, right? So what we're going to grind out in '20 is our expectation to grind down in '21 and going forward. And that's why we're investing quite a bit in our digital efforts and our back office efforts and a variety of other things. So we're taking the P&L cost of investing in those areas with the expectation that we can grind out the productivity in the following years. So that really doesn't go away. We actually have spent a considerable amount of time on our portfolio. It hasn't translated into a lot of inorganic activity, but it's not from a lack of trying. Operator : The next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Just in your Fueling Solutions organic growth guide, how much of a headwind is baked in for China underground subsiding here in 2020? Richard Tobin : In percentage terms, I don't recall. I think it was $50 million more or less in terms of absolute revenue. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. All right. Cool. And then specifically on capital deployment, I may have missed this earlier. I know we talked a little bit about M&A. But how are you guys thinking about the toggle on buyback? And what should we kind of bake in or what is baked into your expectations for 2020? Richard Tobin : It's kind of -- if we reset the clock, Joe, back to 2018, we said we weren't going to sit on a cash pile. Our preference is to deploy it inorganically. Obviously, we did purchase, what's the total, $140 million in total? Brad Cerepak : $143 million, yes. Richard Tobin : $143 million of equity back this year just because we haven't been deploying it inorganically. My preference in '20 would be the proportionality of inorganic investment to rise. But if we can't deploy it efficiently with high returns, then you can expect the same. Operator : Next, we have a question from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Andrew Krill : This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. Can you just comment on the price cost environment you're seeing now and then what's being assumed for 2020 and if you're still seeing any impacts from tariffs? Richard Tobin : I think they were neutral on year-over-year input costs right now. I think that we've got -- we picked up, I think, the year-over-year benefit on inputs in the second half of 2019. So our expectation is relatively neutral, and we think that pricing should be in excess of inflationary inputs, which includes labor, is really our goal. Andrew Krill : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. So we know you have the $50 million takeout -- cost takeout target for 2020. Just if the macro were to slow down more than expected, is there any potential to engage in further restructuring? And can you just size maybe what additional savings that you could read from that? Richard Tobin : Yes. I think that what we're taking out of the $50 million has nothing to do with the demand cycle. So that $50 million is just core reduction of costs. If the demand cycle was to turn against us, clearly, we would take action on our cost base. Operator : And the last question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Charles Tusa : When you guys think about kind of the dynamics around EMV, just -- can you just remind us kind of how that plays out beyond '20? And what -- how you see that kind of trending in '21 and '22, what we have to keep in mind on that front? Richard Tobin : Yes. Our previous estimates was the peak amount would be 2020 and they would have reduced progressively in '21 and '22, more or less about 30% a year. Based on the exit rate that we saw in the fourth quarter, there's an argument to be made that it may be higher in 2020 and '21 because of adoption rates. But look, we only have one quarter of data point to model it. But I think that, as I mentioned, if you heard during the presentation, we know that we've got a headwind in China demand on the underground side. We may have a tailwind on EMV, but we'd like to get a quarter under our belt to see how that's progressing. Charles Tusa : Okay. Great. And then just on Refrigeration. At what stage do you kind of reevaluate the strategy with kind of trying to operate that business better? Is that -- do you feel better about that today or a little more cautious about it given the kind of the sluggish -- stubbornly kind of sluggish performance? Richard Tobin : Look, I mean we're committed to intervening on the cost base, and this is the year when it takes place, Steve. So I think that we're going to run it for the year. I think that where we're intervening is where our backlog is the strongest. So that gives us some pause for success. There are tertiary pieces of the Refrigeration side that we're taking a look at that not -- actively not kind of the production of case door. But on the case door side, I think that this is the year that we got to deliver, quite frankly. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Galiuk for closing remarks. Andrey Galiuk : Thanks. This concludes our conference call. Thank you for your interest in Dover, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Richard Tobin : Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Speaking today will be Richard Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and myself Andrey Galiuk, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and participation implies consent on recording of this call. This call will be available for playback through May 12 and audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for three months. Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. We want to remind everyone that our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject uncertainties and risks including the impact of Covid-19 on the global economy and our customer suppliers, employees, operations, business, liquidity and cash flow. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the first quarter for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich Tobin. Richard Tobin : Thanks Andre. Good morning, everyone. We are going to take some sage advice and briskly go through what was a solid first quarter and get straight to where we are from a market demand perspective, and what actions we are taking with our operations, cost structure, and balance sheet to adapt ourselves to this extremely challenging environment. I am not going to read the next slide, but will mention that the urgency and magnitude of the present challenge is not lost on us, and we are working through these times with resolve and a sense of responsibility to our employees, customers, partners, shareholders, and local communities where we operate.  We understand our role as a supplier to many critical societal functions like food packaging and retail, fueling, waste removal, and many others. Moreover, our businesses supply directly into projects aimed at fighting the outbreak such as commercial cleaning, masks, hospital bed and ventilator production, as well as biopharmaceutical therapy development.  Let's go to Slide 4 of the quick summary of the first quarter results. We recognize these results looking into the rearview mirror. Given the pace of change in the last few weeks, rest assured that despite solid Q1 results, we have zero complacency given the progressively challenging outlook into Q2.  To sum up Q1, our ability to remain largely operational coupled with the work we did in our cost structure and productivity initiatives more than offset the beginning headwinds of Covid-19 which largely impacted our businesses in China and Italy in the quarter. Let's go to Slide 5 and briefly look at segment performance. Engineered products organic sales declined 2% as demand in auto exposed businesses had slowed down. The vehicle aftermarket business also experienced operational interruptions in our China and Europe based facilities. Waste handling continued to grow up with strong backlog. Digital sales in the waste business were up nearly 2x on a year-over-year basis. Pricing cost containment in response to lower volume as well as productivity actions resulted in a 100-basis-points higher adjusted EBIT margins for the segment. Moving out the Fueling Solution, saw robust activity in North America driven by demand for EMV compliant solutions, whereas Europe and Asia declined due to COVID- related production and supply chain interruptions and project deferrals. Additionally, manufacturing in our vehicle wash segment in the US was shut down in March due to local government mandates. Segment delivered 500 basis points margin improvement as a result of favorable geographic and product mix, productivity actions and cost controls, as well as pricing. Imaging and ID declined organically 4% in the quarter. Marking and Coding was approximately flat, and strong demand for consumables due to surge in production volumes of consumer goods in March, which offset the challenging additions in Asia in Q1. Our digital textile printing business had a difficult quarter as all of our operations are in the Lombardy region of Italy, which bore the brunt of the COVID-19. This was further exasperated by the sudden and significant impact of the crisis on the global textile and apparel markets. Margin in the segment declined only 80 basis points as our cost containment actions and favorable mix impact of consumables largely offset the significant volume drop in our digital printing business. Pumps and Process solutions topline declined 1% organically. Strong performance in our hygienic and biopharma pumps as well as in plastic and polymer systems and components largely offset slowing market conditions in industrial pumps and downstream oil and gas complex. The segment delivered another quarter of strong margin improvement, driven by cost containment and restructuring actions, as well as pricing more than offsetting negative impact of Covid inflation and FX translation. And finally, Refrigeration and Food Equipment, organic sales declined 4% primarily driven by weaker demand for heat exchangers and food service equipment, both as a result of governmental actions to combat the Covid around the world. Core food retail business declined less than 1% as grocers began to postpone remodel projects later in the quarter. Segment margin declined due to Covid-related production curtailments in Asia and in Europe, in SWEP as volume reduction in food equipment. From there, I'll pass it on to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks Rich. All right. Let me go to Slide 6. On top is the revenue bridge. As you will know FX was a meaningful headwind in Q1 reducing top-line by 1% or $23 million driven primarily by the dollar appreciating against the euro and also Brazilian, Swedish, and Chinese currencies. Bookings were up 1% organically and were similarly negatively impacted by FX and positively supported by acquisitions. Performance by geography unfortunately reflects the quarter's coronavirus outbreak around the world. All of Asia declined 19% organically; while within Asia, China posted a 36% decline due to significant mid-quarter disruption. Europe was down 7% principally driven by Fueling Solutions and Engineered Products. US, our largest market grew 4% organically with four out of five segments posting organic growth. We expect Q2 to reflect a year-over-year drop in demand in the US and Europe as Covid expanded into April. Also, we're watching cautiously for relative stabilization in China, although startup has been slow in some markets. Let's go to the earning bridge on Slide 7. I'll refrain from going into detail on these bridges for the quarter with three of five segments posting triple-digit basis margin improvement further helped by reduced corporate expenses. In addition to cost actions, margins were generally supported by mixed pricing and impacted negatively by first and foremost lower volumes, inefficiencies associated with operational disruption, FX, and inflation. Outside of steel and fabrications, which started to trend positive, we have seen material cost inflation in the quarter. Now on Slide 8. Cash flow is top of mind as we move into Q2. We're pleased with the first quarter cash generation with free cash flow for the quarter of $36 million, a $48 million improvement over last year. Recall the first quarter is traditionally our lowest cash generating quarter and typically shows negative cash flow. Our teams have done a good job managing free cash flow more actively in this uncertain environment and we expect to continue to proactively manage working capital into the second quarter. Capital expenditures were $40 million for the quarter slightly increased versus comparable period as we continue to execute our in-flight growth and productivity capital projects started in 2019. Most of these projects are slated for completion in the second quarter. Lastly, let me update you on our financial position on Slide 9. We believe Dover's financial standing is strong and positions us well to navigate the unfolding period of uncertainty. First, we have been targeting a prudent capital structure and our leverage at 2.2x EBITDA places us comfortably in the investment grade rating with a margin of safety. Second, we don't have long-term debt maturities until 2025, thanks to the refinancing effort we undertook in Q4 last year, which shifted out the maturities and reduced our interest expense. Lastly, we are operating with approximately $1 billion of current liquidity, which consists of about $500 million of cash and another $500 million of unused revolver capacity. We drew $500 million of our revolver in the first quarter out of abundance of caution when commercial paper markets experienced volatility in late March. Proceeds were used to principally pay off maturing commercial paper. We are back in the commercial paper market in April and will use cash from the program to potentially pay the revolver, if conditions remain stable. So in summary at this time, we expect free cash flow to remain strong for the company as we move into the second quarter. With that I'm going to pass it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Okay. Let's try not to put each other on mute. Sorry about that, Brad. And let's go on to Slide 10. Since we've suspended full year guidance, we'll dive deeper into current trading conditions and our actions over the next few slides. Slide 10, we will cover the current demand outlook as of mid-April and projected status of our operating footprint for the quarter. First, Engineered Products. As previewed in our Q1 results, industrial automation and vehicle aftermarket, as well as industrial winch markets are slowed and continued trending weak with material deceleration in March after positive January and February. We are taking capacity management actions in Q2 across these businesses to right-size our cost and working capital. Waste handling continues to be constructive as our waste municipal fleet customers operate as essential businesses and are seeing large increases in residential volumes, which are more truck intensive. In Fueling Solutions, fueling solution is a bit of a bright spot. Ordered trends have been robust on US EMV and the business saw good trends in March with some sequential slowing in April. Customer base is operational as retail fuelling is generally considered essential business worldwide and record high fuel margins on low oil price help operators offset the reduction in volume and traffic. On the downside, transportation of vehicle wash markets is likely to see delays in capital outlays during this near-term uncertainty. We are largely up and running in the segment except one vehicle wash facility in Michigan and a few smaller dispenser sites in Brazil, Italy and India. In Imaging and ID, digital textile printing will be challenged in 2020 as fashion and apparel markets deal with an unprecedented shutdown of apparel, retail globally. Marking, coating is held up in Q1 with strong orders in February and March. And we expected to be relatively resilient at 40% of the sales are driven by consumables tied directly to current production volumes in fast-moving consumer goods, which surged in Q1 and should sustain as consumers shift to home-based consumption of packaged goods. Parts of this business are not immune notably industrial end markets and printer and sale, service sales as our customers delay plan maintenance due to peak utilization or visitation and/or travel restrictions. We expect to recover such delayed sales at a later time. We are progressing with the integration of Systech which is responsible for the majority the backlog increase if we see in the segment. In Pumps and Process Solutions, while we are seeing sequential slowdown in the oil and gas market served primarily by our precision components business, trends appear constructive in military, chemicals, food and beverage, power generation and some industrial verticals, while biopharma and hygiene are areas of strong growth. Mod plastics and polymer equipment has not seen material project cancellation and continues operating with a solid backlog that equates to nearly half of their annual revenue base. We have a substantial spare parts business in this segment and large share revenue is derived from consumables or installed base replacement versus first fit capital construction. These should be supportive factors. And in retail and refrigeration and food equipment, this segment is facing the largest near-term demand headwind in our portfolio and its spread across several businesses within the segment. In the core food retail business, orders trended positive in February and March, but starting in March many retailers are forced to postpone remodeling and construction projects due to peak traffic volumes, local restrictions and inability of contractors and technicians to gain site access. The backlog in this business is solid, but the shipment timing remains uncertain. We expect that increased wear and tear of store equipment will result in a surge of volume of a frozen refrigerator products being sold will create substantial pent-up demand and we will be well-positioned to capture the rebound when it comes. Overall, we expect several quarters of mix to potentially variable performance in this business. Our Heat Exchanger businesses face both operational disruptions in Asia and demand reduction in HVAC industry globally, with material sequential slowing in March. Backlog is improved in the quarter, but we do see uncertainty here as we must wait for our customers to come back online. Our commercial food service business is facing significant demand challenges in the restaurant segment only partially offset by opportunities in the institutional market. It's no hiding here; March has seen unprecedented decline in order trends will manage capacity aggressively through the year with significant curtailments already begun in Q2. Let's go to the next slide. We have taken a proactive cost containment stance early in Q1. As you can see our SG&A cost has declined in absolute terms in Q1 mainly driven by travel curtailment and lower incentive compensation costs. And a quantum of these actions accelerates in Q2 which I'll cover on the next slide. We are progressing on our $50 million center led cost out program as planned with $13 million achieved in Q1 primarily from IT and a variety other cost items. For clarity sake, the charts are not fully additives at both include SG&A as you can see from the footnote. On the cash flow side, we are cutting CapEx in light a demand environment. We view $100 million as committed in non-discretionary spend, which shows you we have additional flex we have should the downturn be deeper and longer than expected. We carry over $1 billion of working capital in the business, which we scale down with revenue or better primarily driven by inventory management. After all that, let's get on to the most important slide in the deck, let's not sugarcoat this. Q2 is going to be tough despite a healthy backlog; we will be a curtailing or adjusting capacity down across a large proportion of our portfolio companies driven by the following. In some locations government mandates prevent us from operating. You can see in the business that this impacts the most. In several end markets that I touched on earlier, weak demand warrants curtailed capacity.  In food retail, we expect a significant portion of our backlog to shift to H2 as retailers continue facing operational challenges in executing their project as a result of heavy traffic and inability of contractor access. And in category four is driven by proactive working capital management and hedge against weaker demand environment and forecast. We have capacity to catch up the deferred production in the second half. In addition to the loss margin on lower revenue, these capacity reductions and curtailments will cause year-over-year comparative material fixed cost under absorption of approximately $35 million to $40 million in the quarter. We estimate that our variable cost reduction levers and flow-through on inflate programs will positively contribute approximately $65 million in the quarter, which would take you back to the previous slide of the offsets that we had in Q1.  On the cash flow side, we expect inventory management to contribute positively in the quarter. We do intend to pay the dividend of schedule in June and we'll fund both of the bolt-on acquisition of Em-tec in Q2. So to wrap up, let's put some directional guideposts out there for the year in the absence of formal guidance. The year can unfold in with a variety of different scenarios, but it will almost certainly be negative revenue change of yet unknown magnitude. We will focus on what we can control best our costs. We target full-year decremental margin of 25% to 30% of which we have a variety of actions to offset volume under absorption. You saw a glimpse of the levers in the prior two slides and we prepared a full arsenal of actions for the remainder of the year. On the cash flow side, we will reduce our capital spend with flexibility to defer more. We are targeting cash flow conversion in excess of a 100% of adjusted earnings for the year. We have suspended our share repurchases, but intend to continue paying a dividend and lastly our M&A posture remains opportunistic.  We will continue pursuing logical bolt-on acquisitions at rational valuations. In summation, I want to thank everyone at Dover for their perseverance in these difficult times. And let's open it up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hope everyone is faring okay through this situation. Richard, I missed the first 15 minutes or so of the call, but I'm just wondering a couple of things. Your comment on refrigeration and the difficulty getting jobs done. Are you seeing any other situations where it's the opposite? I mean fueling comes to mind, where there's less traffic at the gas station, perhaps it makes sense to actually accelerate and get some of this work done if the capital has already been budgeted. That's the first question. I just have a follow up. Richard Tobin : Okay. Well, the first question, I can't answer it any better than the way you stated it. I mean the fact of the matter is that on the retail fueling side, that's outdoor work, so there's more flexibility, and it is an industry that is I forget what they describe them as is important, I guess or essential. So we've seen obviously no slowdown or any real material issues in terms on the retail fueling side. And on a refrigeration side, it's more indoor work, and because of traffic restrictions and everything you see in the supermarkets going on, I think it's understandable what's happening there. Jeffrey Sprague : Then just to be clear on what you're saying on restructuring. So you're not increasing kind of the $50 million bucket so to speak, but you're doing these other actions on variable costs, G&A, and the like. Is that correct or are you actually stepping up restructuring and what's your scope to pull forward actions you may have had on the table for 2021 and beyond? Richard Tobin : Okay. Well, the $50 million is solid. So, you saw the benefit, I think it was $13 million in Q1. We expect that to be relatively even through the four quarters of the year. If you want to do the mathematics -- the balance of it is not restructuring, it\u2019s cost containment actions of variable costs, and unfortunately the direct labor costs of when we're furloughing and curtailing our operations. So, I wouldn't put in the restructuring bucket because it's more volume related as opposed to permanent cost takeout. Jeffrey Sprague : And then, maybe along those lines. Other things that are not going to come back with volume recovery. There's other things you're doing in corporate or your view on travel in the future those sorts of things or should we expect all those kind of volume related savings to also swing the other way when we do get on the good side of this thing? Richard Tobin : Hard to say. I think what happens with travel going forward from here, but I would expect that 2021 would probably be lower than 2019. If you give every -- if you want an opinion on it, we are as we mentioned that we -- when we establish the $50 million for this year that we're building up plans for another $50 million for next year, we\u2019ll see how we progress on that because the fact of the matter is with everybody at home; working on some of our productivity plans has become a little bit difficult. And we've really had to turn the turret here to deal with immediate cost actions as opposed to longer-term ones. So I understand your question. I think let's get further into the year and I think that we can probably put some brackets around that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Haskett. Ivana Delevska : Good morning, guys. This is Ivana Delevska on for John. So I just wanted to clarify so the fixed 6% SG&A cut that would be incremental to the $50 million of cost cuts, and could you give us a sense of how much would that be in Q2 and Q3? And how are you thinking about it versus the volume decline? Richard Tobin : I would turn your attention to slide 12 in the bottom left-hand corner of the presentation that we posted, where it gives you our cost actions for Q2. We're not going to comment on Q3 yet. Let's see how Q2 presents -- progresses. Other than the fact that the $50 million of structural costs take out, you can divide by four if you want to model it into quarters. Brad Cerepak : And just for clarity, as we said on the chart, the $50 million is inclusive in the 6% down. Ivana Delevska : The $50 million, okay. I get. Okay and then one follow-up. Could you give us a breakdown of your fixed versus variable cost structure ideally for SG&A? Richard Tobin : It's not a meaningful metric in consolidation. If there's follow-up question because the operating companies are so different in their profile, I think I recommend that you get back with Andre for some follow-up questions there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, guys. I know it's early but is it impossible to think about -- start thinking about M&A here and particularly perhaps if there\u2019s distressed assets like food equipment, stuff like that. Richard Tobin : It's not impossible to think about it. Distressed assets are really, I don't know, if that's our bailiwick. I'm not taking it off the table, but if we were to go kind of what the timeline is in situations like this, the first things that come available are distressed assets. Everybody's going to hold on for a V-shaped recovery to see if what happens to asset values of some of the things that we were looking at last year. So, our expectation is what we'll see early on are going to be distressed. It's going to have to be really attractive for us to pursue something like that, Scott. Scott Davis : Yes, and just that and if you said it, I apologize it in here, but how much down are the food equipment business orders? Is it magnitude like 90% or something? Extraordinarily high number like that or --? Richard Tobin : Yes. We didn't size it during the comments but it its very material. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Ronny Scardino : Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Ronny Scardino on for Joe Ritchie. So just first some restructuring, curious does the backdrop make it easier for you to execute on rolling out Dover business services faster to operating companies? Thanks and just one follow-up. Richard Tobin : Well, I think that anytime that you go into a situation like this that it heightens everybody's focus on cost structure for sure. But having said that implementation becomes more difficult with the stay at home. So it's a little bit more difficult. As I mentioned in my comments about deploying some of the people around to our businesses to start working on that. But having said that in part of our year-over-year cost savings DBS is a foundational pillar. So we don't expect it to slow down at all going into the --going through this year. And your next question. Ronny Scardino : And then where across your portfolio do you think there could be more resilience in this downturn? Richard Tobin : Well, I think if you go back and you look at the slide that we prepared on slide 10 gives you the best window of how the business is performing both from a demand point of view and what our operational stance is. I think that should answer your question. That's more granular than generally speaking we give an entry year comments. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just help us understand what's happening in fueling solutions. The extent to which that Q1 bookings number, the strength was maybe something of a blip. Have you seen much in the way of push outs or cancellations around US EMV investments or you expecting those to occur? Richard Tobin : We have not and right now we don't expect. We expect some slowing in Q2 because we had to curtail our US operations at the beginning of April, mostly due to the Covid issue where we had to shut the plant down. Otherwise we would be up and running on the above-ground side based on the backlog that you can see. Julian Mitchell : I see. So on the demand front, you haven't seen too much disruption in the US even with miles driven collapsing and so forth? Richard Tobin : No. I mean I think that as we mentioned that at the close of last year, we said that there was one area with potential upside, it would be that EMV adoption has actually been accelerating into Q4 and that it continued into Q1 unless that stance changes. We don't have any reason to believe for a material slowdown. Now it's not going to be absolutely the same quarter by quarter. It's going to move based on orders, order intake and everything else, but right now we go into the quarter with a robust backlog. I think it will have less production performance in Q2 but that's on us only because we've had to take the sites down as I mentioned. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. Then my second topic would be around the DII segment. There is a very large amount of European demand exposure in that business. Maybe just help us understand how the short cycle trends in European DII or that segment globally. How have those been trending in the very recent past? Richard Tobin : Well, I think that we need to split that business between the printing and ID and then the textile side. The textile side is under enormous pressure. So much so that I would expect that is going to have a difficult full year, just what's going on in retail operations on textile demand? On the printing and ID side, it had a good quarter including Europe because of fast-moving consumer goods production and the amount of consumables that we are shipping. It's difficult in terms of the actual printers themselves and on the maintenance side, but as you may recall that was a business, a business that we expected to have a significant improvement in year-over-year productivity because of management cost actions taken in Q4. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. David Lane : Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. What's been your experience on sort of the recovery in this pie chain and then the early demand recovery in China? Richard Tobin : We have, I would say not material issues in our own supply chain side. I think that had manifested itself earlier in Q1 when China was down. It took a little bit for the freight side of it to unlock. We have some challenges but they're not insurmountable and our comment and China is recovering, but it's a slow recovery in terms of the demand function. David Lane : And then on the potential for other curtailment during this quarter just sort of trying to understand how large or meaningful that could be in terms of the margin impact as you think about it. Richard Tobin : Well, I can't give you more information than we gave on slide 12 right; the curtailments are going to cost us between $35 million and estimated between $35 million and $40 million of fixed costs absorption alone. So that should give you an idea of the significance of the capacity curtailments we're going to take out in Q2. So I'm not going to size it more than that, but we are going to manage this business not hoping for, we're not burning down relative strength and backlog in Q2. We're going to make some bets on the linearity of the demand and in certain cases actually proactively cut production to manage the working capital impact. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Can you hear me, guys? Look, I apologize if some these questions may not be full, I'm trying to manage two calls here, but what, have you addressed free cash flow, Rich, in terms of expectations for the full year and sources of cash from working capital and how that plays out through the year? So just wondering, obviously, no earnings guidance right now but how do you expect cash to perform versus earnings? Richard Tobin : If you go we would take a look at the deck that we posted on 13. We expect free cash conversion to be a 100% of adjusted net earnings for the full year of 2020. And that is going to be influenced by depending on market conditions, liquidation of the balance sheet. Nigel Coe : Okay. And would you expect that to be a bit more backend loaded to liquidate that balance sheets or do you think that's got to be bit more Q2 along with -- Richard Tobin : Well, you know what let's think positive for a moment not as backend loaded as in previous years because hopefully we're beginning to ramp up production in the second half of the year. So it may be a little bit more inverted because we're cutting production mid-year, which we generally are not that's usually what our highest capacity utilization is. So we expected to be more cash generative from a working capital point of view in the middle two quarters and let's think positive about Q4 and hopefully we're ramping up production in Q4. Brad Cerepak : And if any of you missed it earlier, we did take down our CapEx spending expectation for this year and as it says here on page 13, there's further flex there as well. So in our prepared comments we talked about our ability to continue to manage our free cash flow through this year with an expectation that we're going to deliver 100% against adjusted earnings. So how that falls out will depend on how fast we liquidate across the balance sheet right. Nigel Coe : Right. Thanks Brad. Thanks guys. I did see the CapEx. So I'm not completely blind but in terms of pricing you did point 7% pricing this quarter. Just wondering if you can maybe just give the color in terms of what you've seen across portfolio on pricing? And if you have any concerns that maybe pricing has deflation towards the back half of the year. Richard Tobin : I think that we are concerned about it, but we haven't seen any kind of crazy pricing in the marketplace as a general comment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, guys. Rich just like following up on [Indiscernible] and just sort of the progress you made there with the automation project? And talking about the second half of the year with respect, I think sort of talking about the comment you made, you expect some mixed results in the business but obviously stronger demand, so how does that seen over time. So you've got a good backlog. Has been all sort of going together here as you go into the second half of the year? I think you start strong [bel vac] which is good margins. So I guess instead of continuing to ramble can you still do that mid-teens margin in this business or is it just tougher because of the mixed demand environment. Richard Tobin : The answer is, Andy, I don't know yet, right. At the end of the day, we've got a backlog in the refrigeration business that we could run out in Q2 and get all the production performance and do decently on margins in advance of the automation benefit which is in the second half of the year. But based on the signals that we're getting from the marketplace and the inability for our customers to actually do these projects, we are proactively taking down production. It's down now as a matter of fact in our principal sites because it just doesn't make sense to get the production performance and build all the inventory, right. So we'll see in the back half of the year. We believe that there's pent-up demand in this business. It's unfortunate because this was the year where we were hoping to kind of turn the corner and this Covid messes has really put a nail through it. So over the longer term, we're going to continue to work on the automation, so that doesn't stop. It's very difficult for me to say we're sitting here today what happens with the demand function meaning did we just lose a quarter here and that volume is going to bleed over into 2021. It's hard to say at this point, but I think it's better than even bet. On the balance of the portfolio, sure, a bel vac as we said was going to be second half loaded. And we believe that to be the case. The ones that are more difficult to predict right now is SWEP which is if there's been some earnings releases out HVAC already. So you know what's going on there. The industrial footprint of HVAC in Europe has been largely down during the month of March and into April. So we need that to come back so we can resume deliveries. And in food equipment, I think that we're just going to have to retrench for a period of time until all of this lockdown goes away because of the detrimental impact on the restaurant business. Andrew Kaplowitz : Rich, that's helpful. And I didn't hear your comments on engineered products, but maybe you can sort of talk about obviously lot of businesses in there. So how is the for instance VSG doing in the sense that it seems like it more difficult business in this kind of environment, Covid impacted, so you've got a lot about half of that business that's auto focused in some ways. So maybe talk about some of the difference between that business versus waste handling and how the overall retailer business is doing. Richard Tobin : Look, at VSG being objective had a significant portion of the production shut in Q1 in Italy. So the performance in Q1 from a margin point of view was excellent. But having said that it is not those repair shops and everything else are not critical industries for the most part. And are dealing with this whole stay at home phenomenon. So I think the management is proactively taking down production in VSG into manage its working capital itself. But having said that that's aftermarket business. It's basically miles driven and everything else so we would expect that to not be bad in the second half. That's our expectations right now. Some of the smaller businesses like winches, as far as winches and things like that that's kind of, that's more tied to capital goods and that's going to go through a tough year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. And on the waste handling side relatively I mean you saw good backlog there. Richard Tobin : Backlog is good. I think that we're going to manage our capacity down in Q2. As I mentioned about burning down backlog until you get a line of sight. I expect that business to perform well this year, but I think we're going to take production performance down comparatively a little bit in Q2. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Baumann with JP Morgan. Patrick Baumann : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Real quickly on the curtailments for the second quarter. The 10-Q mentioned that 7% of your major global facilities are shut completely as of April 17th. And 11% are partially closed or at lower capacity. And I know it's tough but is that a reasonable way to think about second quarter organic sales down maybe low double-digit or could it be much worse than that for any reason? Like is there a big destock in the channel that would impact you kind of more than what we're seeing in industrial production. Like it just curious any color you could provide on that. Richard Tobin : Yes. That's a good collage try to get Q2 revenue. Look, clearly the deteriorating conditions at the end of Q1 would say that they, and the fact that we came out and said I think on one of the first bullet points that we expect Q2 to be the most difficult quarter of the year when imply that revenue is going to be down exasperated by the fact that we're going to cut production so significantly. But I'm not going to size it for you. Patrick Baumann : Okay. And on the free cash flow maybe. Could you mention, I mean, we talked about CapEx coming down and you're managing working capital in a few different areas. And then the filings also indicate something about tax payments being pushed out. Maybe if you could address sustainability of the actions you're taking and how we should expect some of this to revert on the other side when things get better? Like if the CapEx cut just the deferral of certain things that all come back. Richard Tobin : I think that the demand environment would have to change in excess of our forecast for the second half of the year for the CapEx to come back. So in a certain way I hope that we have to re forecast CapEx backup at some point during the year, but unless the demand environment changes more than our forecast to the positive, I expected not to come up. Brad Cerepak : Yes and the cash flow on the deferrals. I mean I think every company is going to see that type of activity related around the act. So it's not a major number. It's not a big number, but it is something and just speak there's also even on your personal taxes there's deferral of timing, but it's still within a year. So there's going to be some aberration on that but nothing that changes our view on free cash flow for the year. Patrick Baumann : Okay and then just, sorry to follow up that first question since I didn't really get an answer. The schedule curtailments, you said $35 million to $40 million of reduction in fixed cost absorption and then underneath that on slide 12 it says $50 million of offset actions on controllable costs, so is the net number then a $15 million, my taking the 50 minus 35 to 40 to think about the year-over-year impact. Like so you're fully offsetting those curtailment hits. Brad Cerepak : Yes. At the end of the days what's the revs down, you still got to come up with it. That's the number you're missing there. So the fixed cost absorption will offset. Patrick Baumann : Yes. Brad Cerepak : But you lose income on the revs down obviously, right. Patrick Baumann : Yes. Understand. Okay. Brad Cerepak : Back -- plan, so that's a point in time. That changes everyday. So you're trying to interpolate something there. I mean I think if we update that a week from now it'll be a different number either up or down depending on what the situations in facts are in any geo around the globe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Rich, I know it's still early but I was hopefully you could look ahead and talk about what you think might be some of the secular changes from the pandemic and how it would impact Dover's businesses? Any specifics come to mind. We've heard some general commentary about more reshoring, I'm not sure that makes sense may be carrying more buffer inventory. But how do you think these changes the structure of the organization and some of the emphasis on working capital and so forth. Richard Tobin : Yes. I think, Dean that we, Dover are made up by a collection of medium-sized companies that don't really have the longest supply chains. So I think that some of the anecdotal comments about what's going to happen from bigger vertical industrials really don't apply to us to the extent that there is reassuring in a certain way I hope so because that's to our benefit in a lot of cases for some of our components businesses. Deane Dray : But then on Dover specifics, do you see any longer-term changes in retail fueling on like a commuter behavior as well as the supermarkets may be shifting to more warehouse type operations for food delivery. Anything on those fronts. Richard Tobin : Not anything different than we would have thought going into this crisis. No. I think that I don't think there's anything secular other than what we've been always watching at the end of the day. And I would argue that the least on the food retail, we would think that we're turning the corner, that it's more in our favor going into the future, but we'll see. Deane Dray : Got it. And just last one for me. No surprise that you maintaining the dividend. And maybe you just expand on the buyback decision on stopping for now. How much of that is in a consideration of liquidity preservation? Are you influenced at all at some of the political backlash that's associated with buybacks here? Richard Tobin : It's all liquidity. Deane Dray : Thank you very much. Richard Tobin : And when we get to these next few quarters what hopefully that everything's fine. And then we can go back to a capital returns. Brad Cerepak : We just think it's a smart thing to do, right. Operator : The last question comes from the line of Mirc Dobre with Baird. Mircea Dobre : Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Good morning, guys. Rich, I want to go back to the disclosure you provided on slide 6 where you talked about the geographic detail. And just sort of big picture wondering here I mean this whole Covid issue started in Asia started moving westward from there hitting Europe impacting the US now. When you sort of look at your business is it fair to expect that the US could be following a pattern similar to Europe or maybe even down the line your Asia business in terms of growth? Or do you think that there are some particular offsets in your business mix or operations that would make US look different than the other geographies? Richard Tobin : I would think that it will follow the same pattern, but I'd be careful about using the quantum of the percents only because of our participation in different regions like a law of small numbers. But without question and we were talking way we put the slide together, it's like you can almost watch this Covid-19 travel the world and we would expect that with the lockdowns that we had late in Q1 that are in exist today that that same pattern would come to the US or North America. Mircea Dobre : So sorry to pressing on this but I'm trying to understand if Europe right now is a better benchmark for finalizing US business maybe Asia not. Richard Tobin : You can't only because the numerator and the denominators are all different. So you have to be careful about just using the percentages and saying, well, which one should I pick the 19 or the 7. Brad Cerepak : Yes. It's, as we talked about even the fueling business in the US is shown strength and continues to show strength. So it's not the same in every geo in terms of -- Richard Tobin : And I go back to the comment I made before. Make no mistake; Q2 is going to be tough. Brad Cerepak : Right. Richard Tobin : Right. And that's why intervening on the production base, so I mean what element you can put on it, but it's going to be a different. Mircea Dobre : We all understand that we're just trying to do our best from the outside to try to get a numbers as close as we can. And sticking with fueling here, your orders were up nicely; your backlog is up nicely as you sort of think about your business versus the initial expectations that you set up for the year of being up 0% to 2%. I'm just sort of wondering what has worked out different than your expectations then where do you think we are right now in terms of the EMV upgrade cycle in terms of penetration. Thanks. Richard Tobin :  What we haven't had the time to run those penetration numbers. I think when we put the forecast together for 2020 we said, if there was one segment that we thought had some upside, it was going to be fueling solutions because of the order trends that we saw in Q4 about EMV adoption. Clearly, that is held in Q1. So it's better than we would expect but it was within the window of our forecasts. But as you know, we've always been, we spent a year trying to push this adoption rate out and now it seems to be accelerating whether that holds through the year, I hope so, but we'll see. But that's what's driving the backlog. Mircea Dobre : No. I understand that part. I'm just wondering if we're in the third, the fifth or the seventh inning of this adoption cycle. Richard Tobin : I don't know. I don't know. Like I said it, we haven't had time to, with everything that's going on we haven't in time to size it from a total market and as we've said numerous times from a revenue point of view, it's all over the map depending on whether you're doing full dispensary units or just kits. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period for Dover's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrey Galiuk, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrey Galiuk. Please go ahead, sir. Andrey Galiuk : Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. This call will be available for playback through August 12 and the audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for 3 months. Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement, presentation materials, which are available on our website. We want to remind everyone that our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject uncertainties and risks, including the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and our customers suppliers, employees, operations, business, liquidity and cash flow. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the second quarter for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s begin with the summary of the results on Page 3. We expect that Q2 to be challenging and in preparation we reinforced our cost-out program earlier in Q1. So we were in some sense prepared for the battle. We entered the quarter with a comprehensive set of actions to manage through the turbulent times and focused on what we can control our operations, costs and importantly, safety of our employees. From an operational point of view, we are not out of the woods yet, but a significant majority of our facilities are up and running moving into Q3, which is positive to operating leverage as compared to this quarter. Top line trends are very much in line with our expectations entering the quarter. Revenue declined 16% organically and bookings declined 21%. Trends have improved in the quarter and we saw material sequential improvement in June. We still carry a strong backlog across all segments and that increases our confidence for the second half. Margin performance for the quarter was acceptable considering the state of business activity in April and May. After profitability gains in Q1 on lower revenue, we targeted 25% to 30% decremental margin for the full year. Thanks to the broad-based cost control efforts to offset under-absorption of fixed costs and steady execution of $50 million of in-flight initiatives, we achieved 27% decremental margin in Q2, a quarter which we expect to be the trial for the year. That puts us on track to exceed our initial full year target. In addition to the tight cost controls and variable costs, we took further structural cost actions in the quarter as part of our business realignment activities, which will benefit us in the second half. Along with our cost actions, our proactive working capital management resulted in cash flow improvement in both absolute and conversion terms. We generated $78 million more in free cash flow than the comparable quarter last year. As a result of our first half performance and our solid order backlog, we are reinstating our annual adjusted EPS guidance to $5 to $5.25 per share. To be clear, even with a strong backlog and positive recent trends, we still see demand uncertainty in our markets and are not back to business as usual, but our teams have proven their ability to manage costs and operations and we are prepared to operate and achieve results in a wide variety of scenarios that maybe in store for the second half. Let\u2019s take a look at the segment performance on Slide 4. Engineered Products had a tough quarter, particularly in shorter cycle and CapEx-levered businesses like vehicle aftermarket, industrial automation and industrial winches. Waste hauling and aerospace and defense were more resilient shipping against their strong backlogs. Lower volumes led to margin decline versus a very strong margin that this segment posted in the comparable quarter last year and we have taken structural cost actions in this segment, which will support its margin in the second half along with recovering volumes. Fueling Solutions saw continued strong activity in North America driven by demand of EMV compliance solutions, whereas Europe and Asia declined due to COVID-related production and supply chain interruptions as well as budget cuts and deferrals in response to the decline in oil prices. Increased margin performance was commendable with 80 basis point increase on a better mix pricing and ongoing productivity actions. The sales decline in Imaging and Identification was driven predominantly a steep decline in our digital textile printing business, which we expected in the significant dislocation in global apparel and fashion markets due to the pandemic. Marking and coding showed continued resilience on strong demand for consumables and fast-moving consumer goods solutions. This is our highest gross margin segment. So decremental margins are challenging and require heavy lifting on cost containment. Our marking and coding business did a good job achieving a flat margin year-over-year and we have taken proactive actions to manage the cost base in the digital printing business. As a result of these actions and a pickup in textiles consumable volumes, we expect performance to improve in the second half.0 Pumps & Process Solutions demonstrated the resilience we expected. Its top line declined the least among our segments despite a challenging comparable from last year. Strong growth continued in biopharma and medical applications with colder products posting record growth in the quarter. This was offset by a moderate decline in industrial applications and material slowing and energy markets. Our Plastics Processing business revenue declined in the quarter as a result of shipment timing, we expect for it to do well in the second half off a strong backlog. As you can see, this segment continued to deliver a solid margin performance posting improving margin on declining revenue for the second quarter in a row. We expect this segment to deliver flat or improved absolute profit for the full year. Refrigeration & Food Equipment declined as food retailers continued to delay construction remodels due to peak utilization and the commercial food service market remains severely impacted by restaurant and school closures in the United States. Our heat exchanger business showed resilience, particularly in non-HVAC applications. On the margin side, negative absorption on lower volumes drove the margin decline. In Q2, we took structural cost actions in this segment, which paired with ongoing productivity and automation initiatives yield in a materially improved margin performance in the month of June. We expect these benefits to continue accruing in the second half and expect the segment to deliver year-over-year growth in absolute earnings and margin in the second half of this year. I will pass it to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s go to Slide 5. On the top is the revenue bridge. As Rich mentioned in his opening remarks, the top line was adversely impacted by COVID-19, with each segment posting year-over-year organic revenue declines. FX continued to be a meaningful headwind in Q2, reducing top line by 1% or $24 million. We expect FX to be less of a headwind in the second half of the year. Acquisitions were effectively offset by dispositions in the quarter. The revenue breakdown by geography reflects relatively more resilient trends in North America and Asia versus the more significant impacts across Europe and several emerging economies like India, Brazil and Mexico. The U.S., our largest market declined 10% organically with four segments posting organic declines partially offset by growth in retail fueling. All of Asia declined 14%. China, representing approximately half of our business in Asia, showed early signs of stabilization posting an 11% year-over-year decline in the second quarter, an improvement compared to a 36% decline in Q1. Imaging & Identification and Engineered Products were up in China, while Fueling Solutions declined due to the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate and also slower demand from the local national oil companies. Europe was down 19% on organic declines in all five segments. Moving to the bottom of the page, bookings were down 21% organically on declines across all five segments, but there are reasons for cautious optimism as we enter the second half. First, as presented in the box on the bottom, June bookings saw a significant improvement from the May trough, with all five segments posting double-digit month-over-month sequential growth. Second, our backlog is up 8% compared to this time last year driven by our longer cycle businesses and the previously mentioned intra-quarter improvement in our shorter cycle businesses. We believe we are well-positioned for the second half of the year. Let\u2019s move to the bridges on Slide 6. I will refrain from going into too much detail on the chart, but the adverse top line trend drove EBIT declines, although our cost containment and productivity initiatives help offset overall margins to hold up at an acceptable decremental. In the quarter, we delivered on the $50 million annual cost reduction program, which focuses on IT footprint and back office efficiency and took additional restructuring charges that add to the expected benefits. We also executed well in the quarter on additional cost takeout to offset the under-absorbed \u2013 under-absorption of fixed cost previously estimated at $35 million to $40 million. Some of these recent initiatives will continue supporting margins in the second half and into 2021. Going to the bottom chart, adjusted earnings declined mainly due to lower segment earnings partially offset by lower interest expense and lower taxes on lower earnings. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, is approximately 21.5% for the quarter unchanged from the first quarter. Discrete tax benefits in the quarter were approximately $2 million slightly lower than the prior year\u2019s second quarter. Rightsizing and other costs were $17 million in the quarter or $13 million after-tax relating to several new permanent cost containment initiatives that we pulled forward into 2020. Now, moving to Slide 7, we are pleased with the cash generation in the first half of the year, with year-to-date free cash flow of $269 million, a $126 million or 90% increase over last year. Our teams have done a good job managing capital more effectively in this uncertain environment. We have seen strong collections on accounts receivables and continue to operate with inventories of supportive of our backlog in order trends. Q2 also benefited from an approximately $40 million deferral of U.S. tax payments into the second half of the year. Capital expenditures were $79 million for the first 6 months of the year, a $12 million decline versus the comparable period last year. Most of our in-flight growth and productivity capital projects were completed in the second quarter. So we expect to see continued year-over-year capital expenditure declines in the second half. Lastly, now on Slide 8. Dover\u2019s financial position remains strong. We have been targeting a prudent capital structure and our leverage of 2.2x EBITDA places us comfortably in the investment grade rating, with a margin of safety. Second, we are operating with approximately $1.6 billion of current liquidity, which consists of $650 million of cash and $1 billion of unused revolver capacity. When commercial paper markets were fractured at the outset of the pandemic in March, we drew $500 million on our revolver out of an abundance of caution. Markets have since stabilized and we reestablished our commercial paper program and fully repaid the revolver. In Q2, we also secured a new incremental $450 million revolver facility to further bolster our liquidity position. As of June, we have no drawn funds on either revolver. Our prudent capital structure, access to liquidity and strong cash flow have allowed us to largely maintain our capital allocation posture. We have deployed nearly a $0.25 billion on accretive acquisitions so far this year and we continue to pursue attractive acquisitions. Finally, we are lifting our recent suspension on share repurchase and we will opportunistically buyback stock should the market conditions dictate. I will turn it back over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Okay. Thanks Brad. I am on Page 9, which is an updated view of the demand outlook by business we introduced last quarter. Here we are trying to provide you with directional estimates of how we expect segments to perform in the second half relative to the second quarter in lieu of full year revenue guidance. I will caveat that all of this is based on current reads of the markets and is subject to change as the situation remains fluid. First in Engineered Products, shorter cycle businesses such as vehicle service and industrial automation have shown improvement late in the quarter and the trends are improving globally. Additionally, aerospace and defense continues operating from a large backlog of defense program orders. Waste handling may see some headwinds driven by tightening of industry CapEx and municipal finances after several years of strong growth performance. Bookings have slowed in late in Q2 as customers paused their capital spending to manage liquidity. We were watching the dynamics closely, but we have started addressing the cost base in this business proactively. Fueling Solutions is a tale of two cities, North America, approximately half the business remained resilient both on EMV conversion and also willingness of non-integrated retailers to continue investing in their asset base. In Europe and Asia, integrated oil companies represent a larger share of the network and capital budget cuts resulting from oil price declines are having a more negative impact on investment in the retail network, plus recall we are facing a $50 million revenue headwind in China this year from the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate. Despite some of the top line headwinds with robust margin accretion to-date, we expect segment to hold its comparable full year profit line despite a decreasing top line. Imaging & Identification outlook is improving. Our service and maintenance interventions resumed in marking and coding as travel restrictions were lifted and we are seeing a resulting pickup demand for printers. Our integration activities with Systech acquisition are proceeding as planned. We started seeing some green shoots on the digital textile printing side, but we are forecasting a difficult year as global textiles will take time to recover. And Pumps & Process Solutions is expected to show improved trajectory from here. First, our plastics and polymer businesses will ship against its significant backlog in the second half. Biopharma and medical is expected to continue its impressive growth. Industrial pumps, a shorter cycle business, is expected to start gradually recovering. A material portion of demand in our pumps and precision components business is levered to maintenance and repair and aftermarket. The oil and gas mid and downstream markets served primarily by our precision components business continues to be slow as a result of deferral of CapEx and refurbishment spending in refining and pipelined operators. In Refrigeration & Food Equipment, we believe the worst is behind us for this segment. Bookings were relatively resilient for this segment and we have improved in June resulting in a robust backlog that we are prepared to execute against. We also saw growth is restarting the construction and remodel projects resulting in us being fully booked for refrigeration cases into Q4. Additionally, Belvac is scheduled to begin shipments against its significant backlog, which will be accretive to segment margins. Recovery in volumes along with cost actions we have undertaken should result in positive margin and profit trend through the remainder of the year resulting in the segment posting a second half comparable profit increase. Let\u2019s go to Slide 10. As a result of the fluidity of the COVID situation, we are cautious about guiding top line trajectory at this time, but everything points to sequential improvement from here across most markets. The proactive cost management stance we took in Q1 and continued in Q2 has positioned us from a margin performance standpoint. And today, we are improving our target for annual decremental margin to 20% to 25% as we continue work in the pipeline of restructuring actions, including those targeting benefits in 2021 and we are positioned well to deliver on our margin objectives. We remain confident in the cash flow capacity of this portfolio and are reiterating a conversion target above 100% of adjusted net earnings and a cash flow margin target of 10% to 12% compared to 8% to 12% target we had last year. The rest of the slide, Brad covered earlier in the presentation. I will conclude with the following. We have reinitiated EPS guidance as a result of our confidence in our ability to manage costs in an uncertain demand environment. We have a good team and they understand the playbook. Having said that, make no mistake, we are on the front foot from here on driving revenue growth both organically and inorganically. We have strong operating companies and a strong balance sheet with which to support them. This is not the time to hunker down and wait for the storm to pass, so we are equally focused on market share gains, new product development initiatives as we are on our main pillars of synergy extraction from our portfolio, all of which we continue to fund despite the market challenges. Inorganically, we have available capital to deploy and I fully expect to be active in the second half. In summation, I\u2019d like to thank everyone at Dover again for their continued perseverance in these difficult times. And with that let\u2019s go to Q&A. Andrey? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Rich nice quarter. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : You mentioned material sequential improvement in June. Are there any of your shorter cycle businesses that have not improved as fast or faster than expected? And can you give us more color on, if you have seen any sort of slowdown in the rate of improvement in late June and July, particularly in the U.S.? Richard Tobin : We would have not given out full year EPS guidance without seeing June. That is how I think that we have mentioned that when we ended Q1 that June was very important in terms of what we thought the trajectory was. And so, I mean, I think that we went through the bookings change of June and made a variety of different comments about the business about the moving parts of who is improving and who is not. I mean, I don\u2019t want to go through all the companies again. We have got a few, like digital printing, like food service that have not improved and we don\u2019t expect them to improve. So at the end of the day that\u2019s not built into our guidance. But we called out a few of the shorter cycle businesses like aftermarket automotive for example, which has picked up significantly at the end of the quarter. So June was good. I think that we are pleased. It was material to the quarter earnings June. The profit the absolute profit in June was double what we made in April, just to put it in contextually. So I think if you go back and you look based on the I think whatever slide it is in here, the Slide 9, that gives you the color all the color I can give you in terms of the trajectory of the portfolio and the moving parts. Andy Kaplowitz : Great. And then your commentary on Refrigeration & Food equipment was relatively optimistic. May be talking about the second half of the year, but as you said backlogs continue to improve. Have your customers given you more of an indication that they are right to let you into their stores yet. And then we know your automation project was a start-up in July. So maybe just update us on that? And can give us a little more color on sort of the margin trajectory in the second half of the year? Richard Tobin : Sure. Let\u2019s start with Refrigeration. We are booked into Q4. So it\u2019s up to us now to produce the product without have any frictional costs and based on the margin that the business delivered in June, if we can get that for the full quarter, I think, which is our expectation, I think we will be pleased. In addition to that, part of the large backlog that we have in this segment is geared toward Belvac. So we are on the front foot in terms of capacity expansion in aluminum can making and we are participating in that and we have got some relatively large projects that will begin building at higher rates in the second half. And in all honestly, I mean, if we put foodservice equipment aside for a moment, we don\u2019t have the hardest comp in the second half. It\u2019s not as if we exited 2019 firing on all cylinders. So we will \u2013 that\u2019s why we will do better H2-to-H2 on a comparable basis, but it\u2019s largely as a result of heat exchangers continuing to improve modestly over the second half, Belvac shipments and material improvement in Refrigeration cases. Andy Kaplowitz : And then the automation project itself? Richard Tobin : That\u2019s baked into the margin improvement that we expect in the second half. Andy Kaplowitz : Okay. Thanks Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning guys. Richard Tobin : Hey, Scott. Brad Cerepak : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : Rich or Brad, can you give us just a sense of this shape or recovery in China. It\u2019s \u2013 this quarter, I think you said it was down 11%. Does 3Q then become, I mean, if you had to guess, is it more flattish or is it still down and with the chance of being up in 4Q? Richard Tobin : Look, all of the relative decline or substantially all of the relative decline in the quarter is because of this double wall tank issue, which we had guided at the beginning of the year. I think that if we remove that, we were \u2013 I believe we were flat to slightly up on the balance of the businesses. So that\u2019s going to be a headwind for us in the second half. Scott, I have not done the calculations of what that means quarter-by-quarter, but we always had that $50 million headwinds that we were going to have to deal with. It\u2019s a bit slow on top of that in Fueling Solutions, just because the national oil companies in China are not spending any money right now. But if I \u2013 if we eliminate Fueling Solutions, the balance of our business which is mostly Printing & ID, have improved materially in Q2 and you expect that to continue for the balance of the year, and that\u2019s volume related, right. So as China has restarted and business activity started, you can think about marking and coding into the consumption of consumables and things like that. Scott Davis : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on CapEx, I mean you are running at lower than usual levels I guess \u2013 lower than the expected levels. Do you anticipate that having to go up meaningfully kind of 2021 or do you think, I mean, you can imagine need a lot of capacity, but two facilities that need to be invested in etcetera is there \u2013 or is there going to potentially continue through 2021? Richard Tobin : Over, I would say the last where are we now in July, over the last 8 to 10 months, we have had approximately $80 million of spending that were attributed to two projects. One was the automation project for Refrigeration cases and one was the brand new building that we built for Colder Products up in Minnesota. So those \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t have anything in the pipeline of that quantum. So I would expect CapEx to slightly rise in 2021, but not materially as if we deferred CapEx in 2020, and we have got catch-up in 2021. Now having said that, what, if we have got the demand, and we get some projects in that we don\u2019t have in the pipe, we are more than happy to invest organically in this business based on the returns we get. Scott Davis : Got it. Thanks. Good luck, guys. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Brad Cerepak : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Rich and Brad the $13.4 million of cost actions you took in the quarter, how much of that was \u2013 how much of that maps against the original $50 million target and how much was new incremental structural, because I think Rich, you had called out some new incremental structural in a couple of the business segments in your prepared remarks. Richard Tobin : That is the new structural. So the $50 million... John Inch : So that\u2019s all new structural. Richard Tobin : Yes. The $50 million was done and dusted and it was on average $13 million a quarter. That\u2019s what we got in this quarter and that\u2019s what we can expect rolling through the other two. The charge that we took for restructuring in Q2 was new. It was a project that we are working on. We just pulled it forward. So it will have an impact in the second half of the year, but that is baked into our EPS guidance. John Inch : So the $50 million or the $13 million that\u2019s kind of baked in the cake and based on your intentions Rich, when we exit 2020, how much more annualized structural do you think you will have gotten out annualized, so not necessarily all in 2020, by the time we exit 2020? Richard Tobin : How about... John Inch : Incrementally just due to... Richard Tobin : Yes, I know where you are going. But let\u2019s \u2013 give us another quarter, because we have got some other actions in the pipeline. And when we get to the end of Q3, we can kind of give you some color of where we are tracking on the $50 million for 2021, but it\u2019s a bit premature right now. John Inch : Okay. So just to be clear, this is stuff that you are doing that is targeted at sort of baking in the cake the 2021 $50 million or is this \u2013 do we have like a $50 million annually. And then we have this downturn and you go, we can do even more on top of that, or this is all part of that progression of the $50 million? Richard Tobin : Yes. I think this is what we said at the end of Q1. While we are not just going to sit here and wait for the clouds to part, right? We are being on \u2013 we are taking some action on the front foot. These are projects that we had in the pipeline, and because the level of business activity that we had, we just said, why don\u2019t we do it now. So that action was taken. So they are incremental to the 2020 $50 million. They will accrue some benefit in the second half of 2020, and then we will redo all of what we think that we have got in the pipe for 2021 likely at the end of Q3. John Inch : And then, just as a follow-up, what sort of temporary cost actions, is there a way Brad to quantify those like you could call it furloughs or T&E? And I\u2019m curious then Rich, given the environment, right, like a lot of companies are now realizing, people can work from home. We don\u2019t need as much travel. What is your thought process toward turning some of those temporary cost saves, if you could give us the magnitude and just say more permanent cost saves depending on how the economy unfolds? Richard Tobin : Well, look at the end of the day, the temporary cost savings as a result of managing bonus accruals, we would expect and hopefully to build those back next year. So those come back. On the variable cost, mostly in SG&A, I think the jury is still out. I think that clearly we like everybody else have recognized that. What we need to conduct business may be different in 2021 when we looked back historically. So we get ready to do our plans on the operating company level for 2021, the conversations we are having are operating company president is, this is a notion of okay, well, I can go put my \u201819 SG&A back as long as the revenue supports it, but I think it\u2019s a bit premature to kind of monetize that now. But clearly, we are thinking about it and I don\u2019t expect that we will just snap back from an SG&A point of view, back to \u201819 levels. John Inch : That makes sense. And is there a way to quantify what sort of cost actions temporarily you took because of COVID in the quarter or sort of the run rate or whatever? Richard Tobin : Look at the end of the day, we had a $35 million to $40 million fixed cost absorption headwind that we offset with temporary cost \u2013 with cost actions, right? That allowed us to have more or less flat gross margins quarter-to-quarter. Then we offset 30% of the lost revenue with SG&A cuts. Look at it that way. John Inch : Very helpful. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Richard Tobin : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey guys. Good morning. Richard Tobin : Hey, Steve. Steve Tusa : Just using kind of the \u2013 maybe this is like to sneak here something, but using the percentage of sales for free cash flow getting to something in kind of $6.4 billion range for annual sales. Is that kind of around the right level? Richard Tobin : We are going to get to a revenue number by hook or crook here. This is the interesting way to go about it. Look, I think that that we have got line of sight on the percentage of revenue and on the conversion of net income. I expect \u2013 we have exited Q2 with arguably inventory that supports the short, what we can see it for Q3. So I would expect barring a real snap back in demand, outside of what we have got baked into our numbers that will be liquidating inventory between now and the end of the year. Steve Tusa : Right. I guess on the revenue, though, like... Richard Tobin : I know where you\u2019re going. Look, I don\u2019t think the number that you put out there is outlandish. Steve Tusa : Okay. And when we think about kind of the third and the fourth quarter splits, I mean, in \u201818 \u2013 they usually are kind of around each other. I would think this year, maybe with the cost, the structural cost coming in and a bit of that Belvac backlog, perhaps in the fourth quarter. It sounds like things kind of took a step up in June. So maybe you are trending third quarter better. I mean how do we think about kind of the linearity for the third and the fourth quarter normally. Kind of seasonally, it looks like it\u2019s roughly equal, but maybe this year it\u2019s a little lower in third and higher in fourth. How do we think about the linearity there on the EPS? Richard Tobin : You have got your finger on it. I mean, I think that we clearly we have a tough comp in Q4 in DFS. So that will be levered to Q3. The swing factor is going to be where we are on the long cycle side, which is driven by Belvac and Maag, and then to a certain extent, some other companies in there. I hope that we are bringing a lot of that into Q3. And if that\u2019s the case then you would have a sequentially better Q3 and we are talking comp-to-comp here. Steve Tusa : Yes. Richard Tobin : Than Q4. So what\u2019s known is barring a \u2013 and look I hope it happens, but barring a real uptick in demand on EMV in Q4. Right now, our expectation would be that we are down in DFS Q-to-Q. But I think right now based on June we are probably trending a little bit on a comp basis better Q3 and not \u2013 and less so in Q4 right now. Steve Tusa : Right. And then just lastly, just to be clear on this CapEx thing. You guys actually I think raised the CapEx number from where you were last quarter. So it doesn\u2019t look to me like there is, that\u2019s the kind of the free cash flow comp for next year. It\u2019s not like you are kind of squeezing tight there and that you have got a tougher comp on cash next year that this year\u2019s cash obviously is inflated a bit by better working capital, but that we should think about some free cash flow growth next year, despite kind of the unusual situation of this year where things are being squeezed a bit. Richard Tobin : That\u2019s fair. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning guys. Richard Tobin : Hey, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey. So, Rich, you guys did provide like a lot of great color on Slide 9 on what your expectation is kind of for the rest of the year. But I guess, from a magnitude standpoint, can you help provide maybe just a little bit more color on how June actually trended from a magnitude perspective and whether that\u2019s just persisted into July? Richard Tobin : Well, look, I mean, as I mentioned earlier, June was materially better than April, but April I hope that we don\u2019t see again anytime soon. I mean April and May in certain of our businesses, which is a function, a lot of this issue about the declining backlog, I mean we were not shipping anything and we were not getting any orders either. So when we were looking at this decision about reinstituting guidance for the full year, I think that we have got a good playbook in control in terms of the operating cost side, but it was almost entirely contingent upon how June was, how June manifested itself, and June came in both on a bounce back in the order rates and in terms of absolute profit that portends well for Q3. So Brad\u2019s got the joke, if we can just keep having June\u2019s from here on out, we would probably be in good shape for the balance of the year. So that is about the color I can give you on it. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Fair enough. And I guess just as a follow-up to that, I thought you guys lifted your buyback suspension. I guess, how are you thinking about deploying capital at this point and whether you are going to be more aggressive now that you have lifted the suspension? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, I think the hierarchy remains the same of organic investment, inorganic investment and then capital return. I think that the CapEx number that we have given you for the full year is relatively safe now. So it is going to depend on inorganic investment. And if you go back to the comments, I think that the pipeline that we have right now is relatively encouraging and I expect to be deploying inorganic capital in the second half. But having said that, if we are unable to get the returns inorganically that we seek then, we will address capital return and not sit on a cash balance here. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Okay. That makes sense. I will get back in queue. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Hey, just one more here on the June two step, if I may. I am sure June is typically better than May, any quarter right. Good quarter, bad quarter, I mean can you just give us some kind of historical context of how significant the sequential lift was versus what would be normal? Richard Tobin : You know what, I don\u2019t know the answer to that question, because we were \u2013 everything that we look at around here is a function of relative declines. So, which is a \u2013 this tells you a lot about 2020 in the COVID era. But I mean, I think that the rate of revenue decline in June was significantly less than we saw in April and May, but \u2013 if I \u2013 of the top my head, Jeff, I guess the guys are furiously going through pages here, relative to seasonality I don\u2019t know. I think that Andrey is going to have to follow-up with you on that one. Jeff Sprague : Okay. I am on his calendar I will do that with him. We had some discussion here I think on earlier questions about temporary actions. I think it\u2019s pretty clear how you are going to kind of to manage those as they possibly come back. In that context, Rich, as we think about the other side of this valley and managing for growth on the other side, what are you thinking on incrementals? Is there significant headwind from stuff coming back or can you kind of manage this kind of I would guess maybe 30% zip code incrementals on the way back out there? Richard Tobin : Other than bonus accruals, there is really no overhang of deferral of costs that have to snap back. I think the big question, I think there was a question earlier about it and I think this supplies, not just to Dover to everybody is, everybody has reduced travel cost right. Does it come back to \u201819 levels as a percent of revenue or not, I mean, the expectation there is absolutely not. I think that we have proven that we can run this business with less discretionary spending, than we may have thought is necessary exiting \u201819. So, what the quantum of that is, is I think it\u2019s a little bit too early to tell, but we will be reflected in whenever we give our guidance for \u201821 for sure. The rest of it \u2013 you look at the end of the day, I think that we did a admirable job in managing furloughs and a variety of things. So I don\u2019t expect that we are going to run significant industrial friction with over time or anything else in the second half. That\u2019s my expectation. It won\u2019t be perfect, but I don\u2019t see that our incremental margins should have any kind of negative drag once we get to \u2013 hopefully soon, back to growth. Jeff Sprague : And just one last one if I could. So, on the M&A front, it sounds like you clearly have stuff in your sites now, which is the question of whether you can get it across the finish line. Should we be thinking kind of the similar size of what these \u2013 some of these recent bolt-ons have been or is there some bigger stuff in the pipeline? And I will leave it there. Thanks a lot. Richard Tobin : Sure. Actionable it\u2019s going to be similar size to what you have seen. There is some bigger opportunities that are out there, the bigger the opportunity, the more competition. So returns get tighter. So we will see on that front. But I am pretty confident on kind of the size that we have seen year-to-date. It\u2019s just a question of, can we close them in the second half. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just the first question around the Imaging and ID segment, fairly, heavy decrementals in the first half given the gross margins and what happened with sales. I didn\u2019t see too much color on the margin outlook on Slide 4 for that segment. So maybe help us understand, how you see decrementals in the second half and how much narrower those should be in that segment versus what we saw in Q1 or Q2? Richard Tobin : They should \u2013 well, I mean, let\u2019s start from the beginning here. In marking and coding, our margin which is substantially the bigger portion of that segment, our margins were flat. So, all of the decremental margin in that segment was from textile printing. And if we go back and take a look at sequentially last year, textile printing weakened in the second half. So, decrementals as long as marking and coding can hold their margin performance which we fully expect them to do should be less in the second half, just because of an easier comp. Julian Mitchell : I understand. Thank you. And then switching maybe to the DEP segment, there had been a very strong multi-year period for the sort of waste handling piece. It\u2019s somewhat of a niche market. So I just wondered if you could give us any context around what you are thinking for the medium term there, given what\u2019s happened to or what will happen to municipal budgets and what kind of upgrade cycle, you have already had there in recent years. Just trying to gauge, how optimistic you are in that business beyond just the next quarter or so? Richard Tobin : I think that the business management of that particular business has been on the front foot. The non-municipal business, if you go look at some of bigger publicly traded operators, they have cut CapEx because of the profitability headwinds that they have had on their non-residential business. We would consider that likely, just to be deferred into 2021 as they manage their own cost structure. On the municipal side, we don\u2019t see a lot of negative headwinds today, but considering the financing of cities and towns because of this COVID crisis, I think it\u2019s a better than even bet that there is some headwinds coming there and because of that I think the management is taking action on its cost structure to accommodate that today rather than waiting for the last minute. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And on the cost-out point, Rich, that you just made, why that Dover I think you had $20 million of restructuring charges in the first half in aggregate. Sorry if I missed it, but what\u2019s the placeholder for the second half for that number? Richard Tobin : We don\u2019t \u2013 look, we are working on a variety of actions. I think we have got several footprint related actions in the pipeline, whether we will be able to action them in the second half or not, I am not entirely sure, but it\u2019s probably then a better than even bet that we will take some footprint related charges in the second half. But I will give you the quantum when we get it all done. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Julian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning guys. I am kind of curious on, obviously you have elected not to give any revenue boundaries, which I completely understand. But I would be curious how you see the rank ordering by segments in the second half of the year in terms of relative strength rather than weakness. I think in the past, Rich, you have called out Pumps & Process has been the leader, which doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable. But do you still see the similar ranking to how you viewed the world back in the first quarter? Richard Tobin : Look, I don\u2019t think in terms of what we expect to relative to Q2 those nice arrows that Andrey put on the Slide on Page 9 is kind of where we things \u2013 where we think the moving parts are relative to Q2. And then you have got moving parts, because quite frankly, you have had some businesses that are operated through the crisis relatively well. So, we knew the Pumps & Process Solutions, because of it\u2019s exposure on the biopharma side, was in a good position to kind of weather the storm as we got to the end of Q1 and it\u2019s proven that so far. We expected to act \u2013 to hold profits flat for the full year is our expectation despite the headwind on the industrial pumps side. The marking and coding, quite frankly, has had an excellent performance holding margins year-to-date. Look the textile printing business, it\u2019s just what it is, when you have your end market just absolutely blown up, we are just going to have to wait this out and that really will be hopefully a \u201821 story rather than a \u201820 story. So I don\u2019t think that we think anything different today than we did at the end of Q1 in terms of the relative resilience of the individual pieces in the portfolio. Nigel Coe : Okay. Very clear. Thanks. And then, cash is building quite nicely about $650 million at the end of the quarter. You normally run somewhere between $300 million to $400 million depending on the quarter. But if you don\u2019t deploy capital, it seems unlikely you are going to be close to $1 billion by year-end. So my question is, I am not asking you to give us a number in terms of buyback etcetera, but I would be curious how you view cash \u2013 the cash buffer going into \u201821. Where do you feel comfortable, is it back to $300 million to $400 million? So, is it going to run higher going from here? Richard Tobin : Yes. Look, I mean, I think you need to correct for dividend payments into the future, number one. And then after that, look, I think that we are not going to sit on a bunch of cash with negative yield on it for sure. But the buffer will flex up and down based on the probability of inorganic investment at the end of the day, right. That\u2019s going to be there. So if we are returning cash in Q4, it\u2019s because the pipeline that we see right now we don\u2019t have any short-term requirement to sit on the cash. If we happen to sit on at the end of the year, I think that you can almost can through that as a positive signal, because it means we may be building cash because probability weighting of the pipeline looks good. Nigel Coe : Right. And then quickly on inventories, the bulk of the inventory build was raw materials or the majority of it was. Is that a conscious decision to buffer the supply chain? Or this is just one of the things? Richard Tobin : It\u2019s purely on the backlog that we have going into Q3. Nigel Coe : Got it. Okay. Richard Tobin : So I would expect barring a snap back in revenue expectations for Q4 that we should come down in inventory, in finished goods inventory and industrial inventory in Q3, some. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hi, yes. Hi, how are you? Can you hear me? Richard Tobin : Yes. I can here you. Andrew Obin : Yes. So question on supply chains, can you just talk about how much in terms of inefficiency in terms of supply chains have you seen in the second quarter. Anyway to quantify it and how do you see supply chains evolving into the second half? Richard Tobin : It was not a material headwind in Q2. Now, having said that, we were not making a lot in Q2, so the areas that we did have constraints, it wasn\u2019t like we were under the gun in terms of production performance. But for the most part our supply chains are relatively short considering the individual size of our businesses. So, we had a few headwinds here and there, but it was not material from a cost point of view in Q2. Andrew Obin : Got it. So for the second half and going forward, no real changes in how you do business? Richard Tobin : Yes. Well I guess it\u2019s going to depend on the trajectory of all of the businesses, because, look at the end of the day, we have done relatively well on input costs. So, as demand went down, we will be able to extract some benefits in raw material prices and the like remains to be seen. I think we are probably bought forward through Q3 and probably a little bit into Q4, but we have got to watch the dynamics. If business activity snaps back, then we can expect oil prices to go up, so transportation cost to go up and the like. So we will keep an eye and right now, but right now on an input cost basis, we have been a beneficiary, I think in terms of input cost year-to-date. Andrew Obin : Got it. Just a follow-up question, in terms of Europe, I think there was some talk back in May about Europeans trying to catch up post COVID. I think there was talk about VW being staying open in August or some talks about Italian staying open in August. Can you just give an update, anything different about how European businesses that you interact with will treat summer shutdown this year after COVID? Richard Tobin : Andrew, that\u2019s a good question. I will have to get Andrey to get back to you. I think on consumer goods we have seen decent performance which manifests itself in the marking and coding business. I think in heat exchangers, we exited on a positive trajectory from where we were at the beginning of the quarter. So, that\u2019s kind of industrial applications, for lack of a better word. But I would have to get back to you on the \u2013 and look and then we had certain businesses in the portfolio like automotive aftermarket that in April and May were absolutely very low levels of activity. So, June relative to those two months as improved, but I don\u2019t think we need to get overly excited because that base is relatively low. Andrew Obin : Thanks a lot. I will follow-up with Andrey. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning guys. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Richard Tobin : Hi, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So we played a good amount of kind of outlook thing go here and filled in both of the squares. I guess I will just I will try one more edge if you don\u2019t mind? How much of the improvement in June, if you had to summarize was customers reopening versus kind of improving, I mean just turning the lights on again versus really kind of ramping back up into any activity levels? Richard Tobin : Alright. You have got me. Josh Pokrzywinski : I admit, it\u2019s a little in here. Richard Tobin : We had a lot of the businesses that we are absolutely shut in April and May from end market point of view. So you have a reopening aspect to it, and that\u2019s why we were \u2013 when we were talking about the results of the end of Q1, we were basically saying look a lot of this hinges on whether we are right about June or not in terms of the trajectory and we ended up I guess, calling it right, for lack of better word, but our portfolio Josh, is so diverse, if any answer to that question is just not going to be applicable across the entire portfolio. So \u2013 which, quite frankly is a strength to a certain extent. Josh Pokrzywinski : And then second question, I know obviously shippable second half backlog is something you guys talked a lot about today. What does that mean or how do you guys think about the plan for backlog at the end of the year? Is the plan basically saying what we are going to be depleted and orders need to pick to put us in kind of a normal position, exiting the year or is the level of kind of backlog depletion that you are contemplating kind of normal for lack of a better term. Richard Tobin : I think, normal for lack of a better in the longer cycle business where it tends to be lumpy. The Maags of the world and the Belvacs of the world, they are actually building a back \u2013 a long cycle backlog into 2021 today. On the short cycle side, that is going to be more short cycle. So it depends on the trajectory between now and the end of the year, quite frankly. So we would expect certain businesses that have a seasonality to them like Refrigeration that will deplete a bunch of the backlog between now and the end of September, because generally speaking retailers don\u2019t do a lot of installs in Q4 around Christmas time. But now, we will see if that\u2019s changed \u2013 the dynamics change this year. So on the longer cycle businesses, I think right now the trajectory is good is as we deplete, we are building into 2021. On the short cycle ones, I guess it depends on when we get to the end of Q3 and what the outlook for revenue is into Q4, but I don\u2019t see any anomalies in there. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Yes, I just wanted to make sure that nothing about some of the backlog conversion came at the expense of \u201821. It sounds like that\u2019s not the case. So, good to hear. Thanks. I will leave it there. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Deane Dray : Just a follow-up on the M&A outlook for the second half. And Rich, you talked about if it meets your return requirements, but typically in a downturn, there needs to be a process for seller valuation expectations to be reset. Do you think that\u2019s happened already? Richard Tobin : Not as much as we would like, but it is happening I think. Deane Dray : Was that \u2013 is that based upon books that are getting circulated, just how much... Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean based on books that are being circulated and whispered numbers about expectation, it looks like its better than it was clearly in the second half of \u201819, but you still have this notion that the public equity markets are trading quite well. And then so we look at a lot of private companies, because the market segment that we are in and then there is this, well I want because of trading multiples that I see in the equity \u2013 in the public equity markets, but that\u2019s \u2013 that never goes away, but it\u2019s improved some. It\u2019s not improved greatly, but it\u2019s improved some. Deane Dray : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then on the free cash flow for the second half and considering the strength of your free cash flow conversion this quarter, if you are liquidating inventory wouldn\u2019t we expect to see some really strong free cash flow conversions in the second half? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, if you look historically, we generate a significant proportion of our full year cash flow in Q4, which we would expect but with the caveat of \u2013 we expect to draw down inventories quite a bit this year in the second half just because of the lower revenue number. Hopefully, if demand improves in Q4, we may have to reverse that, but my expectation is, is that the seasonality will remain constant, but we are probably not proportionately the way it\u2019s been in the past when we have been growing the top line, where it\u2019s been highly levered to Q4, it\u2019s probably a little bit more evenly balanced this year. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just last one on the pumps business, could you clarify whether the business is exposed to pharma, biopharma anything COVID related in your sanitary pumps? Richard Tobin : It is exposed to biopharma, a material piece of it and that\u2019s what has been driving the growth. And we are going to do an Investor Day around that particular business sometime, when Andrey late August, early September TBD? Andrey Galiuk : Yes. Richard Tobin : Where we will give you more color on it. Deane Dray : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover\u2019s second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrey Galiuk, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrey Galiuk. Please go ahead, sir. Andrey Galiuk : Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our call. This call will be available for playback and the audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for three months. Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. We want to remind everyone that our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject uncertainties and risks, including the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and our customers, suppliers, employees, operations, business, liquidity, and cash flow. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the third quarter for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Andrey. Let\u2019s begin with the summary of results on Page 3. As we guided back in September, July, August trends were positive and we were exceeding our internal forecasts. This dynamic continued through September. In addition to the improving demand environment, we were very encouraged by our manufacturing operations and supply chain performance in the quarter. The solid operation execution had two tangible benefits in Q3. First, it increased our capacity to deliver higher volume than expected from the backlog and our long cycle businesses and as you see the positive impact to the top line. And second, through a combination of mixed and fixed cost absorption it drove a robust margin performance for the quarter. Demand trends continue to improve sequentially across most of the portfolio. The trajectory continues to vary by market and I'll talk more about that, but our diverse end market and geographic exposure is clearly an asset to us in the downturn. Revenue declined 5% organically and bookings are flat with a third of our operating companies posting positive year-over-year bookings for the quarter and more than half posting positive comparable growth in the month of September. We're not out of the woods yet, but the trajectory is encouraging and we continue to carry a healthy backlog going to the fourth quarter and into next year. We delivered strong margin performance in the quarter and year to date. We achieved margin improvement in the quarter despite lower revenue driven by our operational multi-year efficiency initiatives, gaining further traction and by improved business mix, some of which we highlighted at our recent investment day focused on the pumps and process solutions segment and biopharma business in particular. With the strong results to date, we expect to over deliver on our full-year conversion margin target and are now driving towards achieving a flat consolidated adjusted operating margin for the year. Cash flow in the quarter was strong at 17% of revenue, and 127% of adjusted net earnings. Year to date, we have generated 117 million more in free cash flow over the comparable period the last year, owing to a robust conversion management and capital discipline. As a result of our performance in the first three quarters of the year and a solid order backlog, we are raising our annual adjusted EPS guidance to [$5.40 to $5.45 per share]. We're not in the clear on the macro backdrop and performance remains uneven between markets, but we believe that our performance to date and the levers we have in our possession will enable us to [absorb] any possible dislocations in the fourth quarter should they materialize. Let's move to Slide 4. General industrial capital spending remains subdued in Q3 resulting in a 10% organic decline for an engineered products driven by softness and CapEx levered industrial automation, industrial winches, and waste handling. Additionally, our waste handling business had the largest quarter ever in the comparable period last year making it a challenging benchmark. On the positive side, aerospace and defense grew double digits on shipments from a strong backlog and we've seen robust recovery in our vehicle aftermarket business after a difficult couple of quarters. Productivity actions, cost actions, and favorable mix minimize margin erosion in the quarter nearly offsetting the impact of materially lower volumes. In fueling solutions, saw continued albeit sequentially slower growth and above-ground equipment in North America and EMV compliance and regulatory activity, whereas National Oil companies in China continued to defer capital spending amidst ongoing uncertainty. Demand for below-ground equipment has improved sequentially as construction activity restarted, but remains subdued globally. And in China, we're still weathering the roll-off of the double wall replacement mandate. Margin performance in the segment was very good and a testament to the operational focus and capability of the management team and was achieved through productivity improvements, cost controls, and favorable regional mix more than offsetting volume under absorption. Sales and imaging and identification declined 8% organically due to continued weakness in digital textile printing. We've seen improving demand for textile printing consumables. Reflecting recovering and printing volumes, however, has been insufficient to prompt fabric printers to invest in new machinery. We expect conditions to remain challenged for the balance of the year. Marking and coding was flat on strong demand for consumables and overall healthy activity in the U.S. and Asia despite lingering difficulties with customer site access and service delivery. Despite segment margins being down relative to the comparable quarter driven by digital printing volume and fixed cost absorption margin improved in marketing and coding on flat revenue as a result of the mix of effect on consumables and operational initiatives undertaken in prior periods, which also provide a solid base for incremental margins in 2021 as textiles recover. Pumps and process solutions continued to demonstrate the resilience of its product portfolio, some of which we highlighted at last month\u2019s Analyst and Investor Day. Strong growth continued in biopharma, medical, and hygienic applications. Plastics and polymers shipped several large orders from its backlog, which were initially slated to ship in Q4, getting it to a slightly positive revenue performance year-to-date. Compression components and aftermarket continue to be slower and weaker activity in the U.S. upstream and midstream. Industrial pumps activity remained below last year's volumes, but has improved sequentially. This is another quarter of exemplary margin performance in the segment, with more than 300 basis points of margin expansion driven by broad based productivity efforts cost controlled and impacted businesses, favorable mix and pricing, which more than offset lower volume in some of the portfolio. Refrigeration and food equipment posted its first quarterly organic growth since early 2019, which is a welcome sign in-line that we saw exiting the second quarter. Moreover, the recovery was broad-based. Our food and retail business, the largest in the segment, grew organically and restarted remodeling activity in supermarkets. Belvac, our can making business began shipping against its record backlog, which we believe is in the early innings of a secular growth trend. Heat exchangers were approximately flat with continued weakness in HVAC offset by strength in residential and industrial applications, including semiconductor server and medical cooling. Commercial food service improved, but margins remain impacted due to continued weakness and institutional demand from schools, and similar venues, while activity and large chains have slowly recovered. Cost actions taken earlier this year, as well as improved efficiency in volume more than offset the demand headwinds in food equipment, resulting at appreciable margin accretion. We expect to continue delivering improved comparable profits in the segment in-line with our longer-term turnaround plan. I'll pass it to Brad from here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 5. On the top is the revenue bridge. As rich mentioned in his opening remarks, our top line continues its recovery with each segment posting sequential improvement over Q2. Several of our businesses, including plastics & polymers, beverage can making and food retail return to positive organic growth in the third quarter, while biopharma continued its strong growth trajectory from prior quarters. FX, which had been a net revenue headwind for us since mid-2018, flipped in the quarter and benefited top line by 1% or 12 million, driven principally by strengthening of the euro against the dollar. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by 3 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters. The revenue breakdown by geographic area reflects sequential improvement in each major geography, but particularly encouraging is the trajectory in North America and Europe. The U.S., our largest market declined by 4% organically due to softness in waste handling industrial winches and precision components, partially offset by a strong quarter in our above ground retail fueling, marking and coating, beverage can making, and food retail businesses among others. Europe declined by 4% organically, a material improvement compared to a 19% decline in Q2 driven by constructive activity in our pumps, biopharma and hygienic, and plastics and polymer businesses. All of Asia declined 10% organically, while China representing approximately half of our business in Asia, posted an 8% year-over-year decline. We continue to face headwinds in China in retail fueling due the exploration of the underground equipment replacement mandate and slower demand from the local national [indiscernible]. Outside of retail fueling, we saw a solid growth in China. Moving to the bottom of the page, bookings were nearly flat down 1% organically year-over-year, compared to a 21% decline in Q2, reflecting continued momentum across our businesses. In the quarter, we saw organic declines across four segments, but sequential improvement across all segments. And a particularly strong booking for our federation of food equipment segment driven primarily by record order intake in our can making business. These orders relate to large projects that are mostly projected to ship in 2021 and 2022.  Overall, our backlog is currently approximately 200 million or 14% higher compared to this time last year, positioning us well for the remainder of the year and into 2021. Note that a material portion of the backlog increase was driven by orders in our can making business which I mentioned above. Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 6. On the top of the chart, despite a 77 million revenue decline in the quarter, we were able to keep our adjusted segment earnings approximately flat year-over-year, a testament to our proactive cost containment and productivity initiatives that help drive 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Some of the recent initiatives will continue supporting margins into 2021. Going to the bottom chart. Adjusted net earnings declined by 3 million, principally driven by higher corporate costs related to deal fees and expense accruals, partially offset by lower interest expense and lower taxes on lower earnings. The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits is approximately 21.5% for the quarter, substantially the same as the prior year. Discrete tax benefits quarter-over-quarter were approximately 2 million lower in 2020. Right sizing and other costs were 6 million in the quarter relating to several new permanent cost containment initiatives that we pulled forward into this year. Now on Slide 7. We are pleased with the cash performance with year-to-date free cash flow of 563 million, a 117 million or [indiscernible] last year. Our teams have done a good job managing capital more actively in this uncertain environment. And with the improving sequential revenue trajectory in the third quarter, we rebuilt some working capital to support the businesses and our customers. Free cash flow now stands at 11.5% of revenue year today, going into the fourth quarter, which traditionally has been our strongest cash flow quarter of the year. With that, let me turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks Brad. I\u2019m on Page 8. Let's go segment by segment. In Engineered Products, we accept similar performance as the third quarter vehicle aftermarket had a very good Q3 as the business is able to deliver on pent up demand. Notably, we have a tough comp in Q4 due to some promotional campaigns, but this is a business which has excellent prospects for 2021. Activity in waste handling is picking up with private haulers, but orders placed are mostly for 2021. We expect Municipal volume to remain subdued for the balance of the year. Demand is reaccelerating for digital solutions in the space and overall we are constructive on the outlook for this business into 2021. We are seeing some encouraging signs and industrial automation and automotive OEM markets in particular in October. Aerospace and defense continues to be steady, most of what we plan to deliver in the next quarter is in the segments backlogs. We don't expect material upside and/or downside from our forecasts. We expect margin to be modestly impacted by volume and negative mix relative to Q3 largely due to demand seasonality. Fueling solutions remain constructive finishing the year and into 2021. As we've been guiding all year, we have a tough comp in Q4 due to record volumes in the comparable period. Despite the top line headwinds, we expect to hold year-over-year absolute adjusted operating profit as a result of our efforts done on product line harmonization productivity and pricing discipline. We expect 2021 to be a good year as demand trends remain constructive for our above ground and software solution businesses and we turn the corner on below ground fluid transfer and vehicle wash. Imaging and ID\u2019s remain steady. We saw robust activity in marking and coding exiting the third quarter and the backlog in the business is higher than last year. Activity and serialization software space is also picking up nicely. In digital print, demand for inks has picked up, which is a sign of improving printing volumes. We are seeing a pickup in quotations for new machines, but we expect a few more quarters before we returned to normal levels in this market. In Pumps & Process Solutions, we expect current trends to continue the biopharma plastics and processing continue [indiscernible] trajectory in pumps recovering to more normal levels, particularly in defense and select industrial applications. Compression product lines within the precision components exposed to mid-and-downstream are likely to see continued weaknesses in Q4 as projects and maintenance continue to be deferred. Overall, the pumps and process solutions outlook is supported by segment backlog that is aligned with what we had at this point last year. Let's get on to the last segment Refrigeration & Food Equipment. First, as said we are in the early innings what we believe to be a multi-year secular build-out of can making capacity, as evidenced by our backlog driven by the transition from plastic to aluminum containers and also the spike in demand for cans at home consumption of food and beverages. In food retail we deliver low teens margin for Q3 converting on our backlog providing us a baseline to reach our 2021 margin aspirations. Our backlog is beginning to build moving into 2021. As you all know, this is a seasonal business. So, Q4 volume and fixed cost absorption declines in Q4. And frankly it's all about 2021 from here and Q3 was a sign of good progress. We have a robust backlog and heat exchanges and are constructive in this market. Our capacity expansion projects are being completed and we have some interesting new products in the pipe. Finally, in commercial food service, large chain should continue to support activity, but will not fully offset weakness on the institutional side. Overall for the segment, comparable profits and margins for the segment are forecasted to be up in Q4 into the comparable period. With strong margin performance to date, we intend to deliver approximately flat year-over-year adjusted margin this year, despite a lower revenue base. As you may recall, we entered the year with a program entailing $50 million in structural cross reductions as part of our multi-year program highlighted at our 2019 Investor Day. We [action more] structural initiatives, which resulted in approximately $75 million of permanent cost reduction in 2020, leaving a $25 million annualized carryover benefit into 2021. We view this as a down payment on the 2021 portion of our multi-year margin improvement journey. And we'll update that with more to come on 2021 when we report the fourth quarter. We expect robust cash flow this year on the back of solid year to date cash flow generation and target free cash flow margin at the upper end of our guidance between 11% and 12%. Capital expenditures should tally up to approximately $159 for the year, with most of the larger outlays behind us. In summation, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $5.40 to $5.45 per share for the full year above the top end range of our prior guidance. We remain on the front foot in capital deployment posture with several bolt-ons closed last quarter. We have multiple opportunities in the hopper, and we hope to report on those soon. And as usual before wrapping up, I want to thank everybody at Dover for their work and continued perseverance in these uneasy times. And with that, Andrey, let's go to the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from a line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys, good morning. Richard Tobin : Hi Steve. Brad Cerepak : Hey Steve. Steve Tusa : Just trying to reconcile the kind of 4Q guide here, I mean, I didn't really hear when you walked through the segments, there wasn't really anything that suggested that, you know, any one of these segments or at least in total are going to be down materially year-over-year. Yet I think your, you know 4Q guide implies a decline in EPS. And I understand tax rates going to be a little bit higher, maybe that's like $0.07 or $0.08, but is there anything that we're missing there? I mean, refrigeration is usually the most seasonal and the backlog there was like, you know, pretty [eye poppingly] strong. So, anything we're missing or is this just a bit of conservatism? Richard Tobin : Well, I would have hoped that when we did the Investor Day in the middle of the quarter that we were pretty forthright of what we thought the Q3 was going to be. And we would have hoped that estimates for Q3 would have moved up and that Q4 would have moved down and we've got neither. So here comes the Q3 is great, but Q4 is going to be a [myth, a narrative]. Steve Tusa : That's not from me, just to be clear. Richard Tobin : No, that was a general comment. That was not aimed at you at all. So look, you know, we have a bad comp and DFS, which we've been highlighting all year, just because of the fact that if you recall, we had a bunch of orders last year. We had some operational issues in the Q3. So, we shipped a ton in Q4, that's always been hanging out there. We over delivered to our this year's forecast in vehicle services group, which is a lot of the reason that we did a lot better in Q3.  So, if you think about automotive aftermarket, we had a couple really poor quarters. We had a lot of pent-up demand. I think operationally we hit the ball out of the park and delivered and over delivered what we'd expect our forecast to be. So that gives us sort of a negative comp going into Q4. Despite the backlog and refrigeration, I think I would caution you on the segment backlog while we're building backlog and refrigeration for [2021 deliveries] that backlog figure is materially impacted by the backlog that we have at Belvac, which is over $200 million worth of deliveries.  So, you know, and finally, you know, we're still getting COVID reports, particularly in Europe. So, I think there is an amount of prudence about, you know, are we going to have to take facilities down? Are certain regions of Europe going to be impacted from a demand cycle? So, I don't think it's bad news at all, quite frankly, in some of our higher CapEx businesses, like waste management, we're getting orders for 2021. Clearly, we could build that product and get the industrial absorption, but I've got absolute confidence in our management team, that let's manage our inventory in Q4, and we start up next year with high build rate. So overall, is there some conservatism in there? Sure, there is and that, until we get on the other side of this COVID issue, will continue to operate under that stance, but is there anything going on in terms of any particular market getting worse from the trajectory that it's on now? Absolutely not. Steve Tusa : Yeah. Just a specific follow up on that. I think you said hold year-over-year absolute profit in your comments at DFS for 4Q, does that mean that's flat or was that just, hey, we'll hold it within a range? And then just to be clear on Belvac, is that still a, you know, pretty profitable business? Richard Tobin : The absolute profit comment was for the full-year of DFS. So, margin benefit outweighs top line decrease. Steve Tusa : Okay. Richard Tobin : And on Belvac, it is accretive to the segment margins. We are beginning to do a transition to a higher mix of turnkey projects. So, there's some pass through revenue. So, I think it'd be a little bit careful about the assumptions of Belvac, but we'll take it because, quite frankly, it's approved \u2013 it's accretive to the segment for sure. Steve Tusa : Right. Okay. That's it. Thanks a lot. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Hi Scott. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Scott Davis : Richard didn't talk about M&A markets at all in your prepared remarks, I just wonder if there's a bit of an update on either activity out there that you're seeing or opportunities or valuation or anything you might share with us. Richard Tobin : It's not a lot different than it was at the end of Q2. I mean there are some opportunities out there. Valuation continues to be reflective of the public markets. So, despite, you know, every, you know, even private companies are trying to see through the downturn of 2020 and want to be paid on 2021. So, it's pricey out there. A lot of competition in terms of private equity, but having said all that, on some of the more [niche opportunities] that we have, we're feeling good about some of those opportunities there. Some of which we highlighted during the Pumps & Process Solutions day that we did mid-month. So you know, we've got a pretty good list of candidates, but we're not going to overpay. And you know, and I think that some of these deals are taking longer because as you can imagine, due diligence under pandemic is a bit difficult. Scott Davis : I'm sure it is. So, just moving on, I\u2019m kind of curious on your opinion on capital spending, you know, there's a lot of uncertainty out there, you got a election, you got pandemic that, you know that, obviously, in the middle of \u2013 but at the same time, money's cheap. And, you know, no better time to invest ahead of a recovery, I suppose. So, are your customers delaying capital spending? Is this kind of a normal down cycle response? And we'll see a quick recovery or do you think there's any sense that things could be a little bit different, and people delay a little bit further, just given perhaps higher corporate tax rates and other noise that's out there? Richard Tobin : Look, I guess my overall comment is there's a bit of seasonality. And I'm just not going to do the project in Q4 because I can do it in Q1 of next year. The general commentary if I exclude kind of some of our businesses like textile digital print, which has some secular headwinds associated with it, which are particular, what we're hearing from our customers is a desire to spend in 2021 on productivity CapEx, which generally speaking is, makes up about 85% of our portfolio. So, going into 2021 as you can imagine, we\u2019re beginning to start to do the forecasting and the budget. You know, we feel good about a lot of our businesses. I think it \u2013 like if you take something like waste handling right now, the municipalities are going to sit on their hands now until they see what their budgets are for 2021, but on the private sector, we just think that we could build off our backlog now if we want, but I don't think there's any reason to do so, and we'll hold our powder dry, manage our working capital, and come out at the beginning of the year at high build rates. Scott Davis : Okay. Thank you, Rich. Good luck. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hi. Two things, Rich. First on pumps, I mean, the margins were extraordinary. You mentioned a little bit of, I think, revenue pulled forward. You know, was there some kind of additional mix or volume dynamic there? And how should we think about the margins in this segment going forward? Richard Tobin : Yes, there \u2013 I think we got to be careful about promising margin accretion from here. I guess we just take it in absolute revenue growth. But look, my comments on the quarter was on the long-cycle side, which is particularly [MOG]. Timing those revenues is always difficult because of the size of the orders and you're dealing with letters of credits and a variety of things. But my opening commentary, as a general statement, I think that the operational performance of the Group in Q3 was excellent. I think that we're really beginning to get some traction and this is across the portfolio. In terms of what we've been working on, on operational efficiency and supply chain, and look, MOG built the product, it was ready to go and we were paid and out the door it goes. So \u2013 and that, generally speaking, is margin accretive, and you couple that with the fact that the trajectory on the biopharma side continues on and you get the margin performance that you see here. Jeff Sprague : Interesting. And then, maybe a two-parter on DRFE, if I could, actually? So, we're seeing actually, you know, very strong results out of some of the food retailers, Albertsons today, actually. Is there any particular, you know, unusual issue with access at this point? Obviously, we've got seasonality, but you know, how do you see that playing out? And then, just a little bit more on Belvac, are you just seeing, kind of \u2013 I don't know, kind of conceptually, I guess the switch being flipped on, you know, plastic, you know, to aluminum, did something really dramatically change in the thinking of your customer base here? Richard Tobin : Sure. Let's deal with Belvac first, I\u2019ll flip the answer. Capacity has been extremely tight. It was tight in 2019, and then, COVID flipped it over in terms of the demand function. Think about beer, right? No one's consuming keg beer, it's all flipped into cans, so there's been a surge in terms of can demand. And if you go look at some of the bottlers, they've been [indiscernible] about canned pricing for some time, so here comes the capacity wave. These are big projects, so the planning period to get them up and going. We've known about them coming, I would say for a year now, but I think that COVID really drove the demand. So you've got the COVID issue in terms of the transition to kind of more at home, if you will. Overarching all that, you have this issue with PET and recyclability and a variety of other things. So that's why, you know, you've got a pull forward in terms of this massive capacity expansion being announced, which is driven by the shorter-term demand cycle. But I think that the can-makers would tell you that they believe it's secular because they think that they have an advantage from an environmental point of view. So, for us, we think that this is, you know, two to three years minimum, in terms of the secular trend for us, in particular on the machinery side. Back to refrigeration, look, we expected this year to be better. I know it's a low bar in terms of the demand function and we got negatively impacted by COVID because of access rights and everything else. We ran a capacity in Q3. As I mentioned my comments, we did low teens margin for the refrigeration piece of the business, which is a good harbinger in terms of what we're capable of doing, level loaded. Q4, it's all about there's a seasonality portion of this business. You generally don't do store refurbishments going into the Christmas season because I think it's going to be a stay-at-home Christmas, clearly. So, they're going to protect their infrastructure. But we are beginning to build a backlog for 2021 delivery now, so you'll see some under absorption in Q4, but as I mentioned in my comments, it's all about 2021 for us here. Jeff Sprague : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. You mentioned just now, Rich, it's all about 2021 and fully agree, maybe on that point, you know, Slide 9, I suppose, you know, you give a little bit of color on the \u2013 you know, the cost savings and that $25 million carry over into next year. Just clarify perhaps that \u2013 you know, there'll be extra cost saving measures on top of that that we probably hear about a Q4 earnings. And also, any way to size the return of some of those temporary cost-outs that are not semi-permanent, you know, just to try and understand any magnitude on that for next year? Richard Tobin : To your first question, we said that we were going \u2013 we were \u2013 it was a three-year program, a $50 million a year. We've pulled forward $20 million to $25 million into this year, so you get a calendarized carry over. But the fact of the matter is, we've got enough in the pipe that we're confident that we'll get the $50 million, and to the extent that we can work hard on it, we'll get kind of the roll forward of the calendarization carried forward in 2021. That's what I can say about in terms of absolute structural cost takeout.  On the temporary side, I think that we need to be careful because a lot of the temporary was based under furlough legislation that was available, okay. And that is going to be dependent on revenue and volume, so let's kind of put that aside for a moment. The rest of what we can call temporary or controllable is in the SG&A side. Look, at the end of the day, we would hope to build back comp, so that's a headwind, but I think that's important for morale around here. But on the other hand, clearly, on [T&E] and some of the other things, I do not expect us to come back to 2019 levels, no matter what the revenue profile is for 2021. So look, at the end of the day, Julian, it\u2019s going to be embedded in whatever guidance we give you for 2021, but we don't expect a full snapback to kind of 2019 comp SG&A levels. Julian Mitchell : I understand. And anything, Rich, you could remind us on around kind of normal operating leverage that we should expect at Dover assuming next year revenues are up, but not dramatically, let\u2019s say? Richard Tobin : Yes, its \u2013 look, we have a wide range of margin profiles between the businesses and depending on what the starting point is, then the leverage is going to be different. So \u2013 and, you know, you heard the question before about pumps and process solution, I think it's fair to say that you're not going to get a lot of fixed cost absorption out of that particular segment, but any revenue that we get at current gross margins is going to be highly accretive. So, we look at it that way for that particular business, as opposed to digital textile printing, where you've had a very difficult time this year. We think that the operational leverage, when that comes back, is going to be in excess of gross margin level. So, it's a bit of a mixed bag depending on the current trajectory between 2020 and 2021. Julian Mitchell : That makes sense. And maybe just on the revenue line then for next year. DFS, I think you'd mentioned a good outlook for next year, but I suppose that the bookings, you know, have been tough for two quarters, probably tough again in Q4, and you have those question marks around U.S. EMV that always get brought up. So, you know, maybe don't focus too much on that specific piece, but maybe help remind us why you feel good about the DFS topline next year? Richard Tobin : I'm glad you asked that question because as we mentioned, we did the Investor Day for Pumps & Process Solutions that we were going to do another one this year, we'll be announcing shortly another virtual Investor Day, which we will concentrate on the Fueling Solutions business and hopefully answer all your questions about 2021 trajectory and what we think the strengths of that business is. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citi Group. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Good morning, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Rich, can you give us more color into the progress you've been making in Refrigeration in terms of margin? At one point before the pandemic, you talked about hitting that 15%. You did have double-digit margin in the quarter for the first time in over a year. But looking out into 2021, have you seen enough from them in terms of execution in that segment and what you have in backlog? You talked about Belvac, so you get continued sort of nice margin improvement and you can hit those goals that you set for yourself? Richard Tobin : We're not all the way there yet. We're not getting the benefits of the automation in terms of the labor content, so we actually got to low-teens margin in the quarter without that. So, everything's pointing up. I think it is purely going to be a function of the demand profile of the business for 2021. What we can see right now or what we hear from our customer, I think it's going to be proactive for 2021. So meaning it looks like barring another wave of COVID, that revenue should rise for Refrigeration next year and we'll get the benefit of both the productivity and the operational leverage. So, you know, we're not \u2013 it's not all in the bag yet, but we're cautiously optimistic based on what we've seen in Q3 and I would not panic about Q4, just because of the negative leverage that we're always going to get in that segment. Like I said, it's all about 2021 from here. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. And then, Rich, you mentioned, you're going to have that DFS Analyst Day, but if you step back, I mean, you have 14% backlog growth as you mentioned, you sound pretty constructive about 2021. So as you look out, are there any businesses other than DFS that you're more worried about? Or do you actually have pretty good backup visibility at this point, maybe even better than average toward growth in most of your segments in 2021? Richard Tobin : We worry about them all. But I think I mentioned a few. I think that we've been proactively prudent in ESG by cutting capacity early just because of this municipal issue, so we would expect to carry some negative leverage from 2020 into positive leverage in 2021. We feel really good about vehicle services group for 2021 [faced on] mostly \u2013 you know, the amount of miles driven, the amount of used cars that are out in the fleet and I think that management has got a lot of really great productivity initiatives in the pipe coming there. Let's see, I mean, I don't want to go through them all one by one. Refrigeration, we talked about. You know, we'll be cautious on digital printing, that's probably going to be a second half of 2021 in terms of the upturn. And look at if \u2013 and if Pumps & Process Solutions just can continue that trajectory that they're on, that is absolutely satisfactory. So, you know, we're not out of the woods. You know, we've got some business in terms that are highly leveraged towards CapEx. It's a little bit of a wait and see, but, you know, we're in the process of doing 2021 forecasts and we feel good about the demand function and we feel good about the rollover of our productivity initiatives going into next year. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, guys. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, Rich, picking up on the answer on Refrigeration, so kind of went back over some notes here, I think originally, you had said the food retail automation project was going to reduce labor hours by 50%. You're going to cut SKUs from 400 to less than 100. You were talking about dramatic declines in base permutations. Have those objectives been realized? And you mentioned that the \u2013 you know, the 50% labor wasn't really necessarily in that, so does that mean that that's on the [come because] it's a matter of timing or perhaps the parameters for expectations or cost-out or whatever changed, just any kind of more color on that automation project would be helpful? Richard Tobin : Sure. I mean, we are slightly behind in terms of the automation just because that we couldn't get contract or access for a period of time into our site, so that kind of gummed up the process a little bit. We're making good progress in terms of SKU management, but that is also a function of the demand cycle and somewhat a function of us getting the automation up because you need to kind of sell the benefits of the automation to your customer because those are the ones that you're convincing to change the SKUs at the end of the day. So look, I think that we're probably \u2013 you know, taking Q3 into account, we're halfway where we would expect it would have been under a more normal 2020 conditions. I guess that I can answer it that way. John Inch : No, that makes sense. Assuming that the demand trajectory continues, where do you get to the point where you say, all right, automation is done and now you're getting the full bore of the cost benefit or the productivity drivers toward, say, variable contribution from future volume uplift? Is that sometime mid-next year or perhaps a little earlier? Richard Tobin : It would be \u2013 this is \u2013 you know, it's a bit of a reverse barbell, so it would be Q2 and Q3 of 2021 where we would expect to see the tangible benefits. John Inch : Okay. And then, I did want to ask you about Wayne Tokheim. You know, [indiscernible] just went public and they talked about 2020 is the peak year for EMV. You talked about EMV being strong this quarter as they did. I'm curious if you would concur with that? So 2021 is an absolute revenue drop off and strategically is Wayne Tokheim considering, say, branching into electric vehicle infrastructure to diversify the petroleum footprint to a greater extent? I know, you've got this alliance with ChargePoint. It doesn't look like there's a revenue or profit sharing mechanism with that, but what are your thoughts, Rich, just strategically on and I realize [EV] is very far out, but, you know, markets discount the stuff and worry about it sooner versus later? Like, how are you thinking about it [indiscernible]? Richard Tobin : John, I don't want to take away from all of the effort that the management team is undertaking right now to prepare for this Investor Day in November, which should answer all of the questions that you just asked. I think that the only thing that I will say that there was some talk about sizing the headwind for 2021. I would caution you that EMV is a North American phenomenon and our exposure in terms of the North American market is different than \u2013 so I think you have to size that appropriately and that our product mix between above-ground and below-ground is significantly different. You know, we've been carrying around a pretty weak below ground market this year, right? We had talked about the headwind on [doubled-wall] for China when we gave the guidance for this year, but then, you ran into COVID with access rights and construction and everything else. So, you know, at the end of the day, sure, margins are up. Some of that is driven by EMV demand for sure, but I don't want to take away from the productivity improvement that the management has done here that has driven margin accretion despite the topline. So, what our thoughts are in 2021, I'll leave it to November. When we get to it is that the EMV headwind is manageable to the extent that the below-ground business returns to growth in 2021. John Inch : Perfect and I'll leave the EV stuff for the Investor Day. Thanks again. Richard Tobin : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hi, good morning. Richard Tobin : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question and it's sort of been asked in different format, but how do you think of the businesses that are doing well? How much will be sustainable in 2021? But just trying to see as things normalize, do you think businesses mean revert i.e., things have been doing well and during COVID sort of get a little bit weaker and things that, you know, were weak, get stronger or do you see structural changes in the longer-term growth rates within your portfolio post COVID? Richard Tobin : Let's see here, look, the only business that we have that if tangibly benefiting from COVID today would be biopharma, but that is a business \u2013 I think we sized it up for you. I mean, look, it's great. It's growing fantastically. The margins are terrific, but it's not overly materially weighted in the portfolio and that's the one that's benefiting. I mean, all this \u2013 you know, Belvac is going to benefit, but we believe that that is more structural than COVID-related just because of this issue of recyclability and moving away from PET. So, you know, we don't think that we have a COVID tailwind embedded anywhere on our business, so it's purely a question of the ones that are suffering, the portions of the portfolio are suffering, which ones are coming back. I think it's fair to say that the one that we're taking a close look like is that our compression business, which is the one that's levered most to midstream and downstream, whether that demand in terms of CapEx or maintenance remains subdued in 2021 or not. But again, that is not overly significant to the portfolio and we can weather the storm. So, you know, our expectation is that the parts of the portfolio that are doing reasonably well will continue to do so and the ones that have been under more pressure will come back on different trajectories based on their end markets. Andrew Obin : Alright, thank you. And just a follow-up question on and I apologize if it\u2019s been asked, I've been getting disconnected. On textile printing, on the printing and ID, textile printing CapEx, you highlighted it, you know, digital printing, sort of weakness. Given the strength in consumer spending, just a little bit surprised that this business would be weak, can you just provide more detail as to what's happening there? Richard Tobin : I wouldn't consider it to be weak. I mean, revenues were flat\u2026 Andrew Obin : Okay. Richard Tobin : \u2026and margin was up. I mean, yeah, the consumable business is tracking right with consumer goods, which is great. I mean, the printer business and the service business is still a bit choppy because that still requires access rights\u2026 Andrew Obin : Okay, okay. Richard Tobin : \u2026and customer locations and everything else. Andrew Obin : So, it's pretty straightforward. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Hi, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey, Rich, how do we think about the backlog conversion in Refrigeration and Food Equipment? And the reason I asked the question is, if you go back to like the \u2013 you know, few years ago, you know, 2015, 2018, its pretty \u2013 is a pretty one-for-one type of relationship between your orders and your revenue. And so, clearly, you know, in 2019 and in 2020, orders are much better than what your revenue run rate and I know part of that is the automation project. But like, how do I think about like the length of the backlog and how that converts over the next couple of years? Richard Tobin : Yes. Let me think about this. We are \u2013 look, we give segmental backlogs and I think that we size the portion of Belvac that's in there, which distorts that backlog because somewhat. You know, the Refrigeration business in particular is relatively short cycle. So, to the extent that we're getting orders for 2021 is actually early. Now, well, it would have been early, let's call it a month ago, which is a good sign because it's \u2013 generally speaking, food retailers don't kind of secure capacity. They just believe that that markets have been over capacities forever, so they just place the orders and you run through hoops to deliver it to them. So, I think the good news is based on what our customers are saying about their own CapEx and maintenance programs that we expect it to be up in 2021. And the other good data point is, is that we're getting orders for 2021 now, which is technically early, a little bit early, so that's the good news, but I wouldn't try to disaggregate our segmental backlog because you've got Belvac in there and it's very material. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Okay, that makes sense. And then I guess maybe just kind of the one follow-on question would be just around like capital deployment. I know that you guys, you know, reinstituted the buyback last quarter. It didn't seem like you guys did much this quarter. How are you guys thinking about that versus \u2013 you know, you mentioned, you know, [$200 million to $500 million] type deals like where are you kind of like prioritizing your investment right now? Richard Tobin : We're still prioritizing on the inorganic. We had to walk away from one in the quarter because of \u2013 for particular issues that would have been an outlay in excess of $300 million, so that has changed plans a little bit. Look, at the end of the day, it's a wait and see. We've got a decent pipeline. We'd like to convert that free cash into inorganic investment. But we're not just going to do deals to deploy the capital, right? They have to be smart and they have to be within the parameters that we've laid out. And if not, then we'll revisit capital return and I'm sure that will be a discussion. We have the board meeting next week. Joe Ritchie : Okay, good to know. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, good morning, guys. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Richard Tobin : Hi, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground already. But, Rich, I want to come back to another comment earlier on the backlog and kind of the visibility into the first quarter first half relative to normal. How would you size that? I mean, clearly, you know, I think you're trying to focus people on the comfort with 2021 over 4Q. I totally get that. Any way to put some guidelines around, you know proportional visibility this time of the year versus what you would normally have? Richard Tobin : I think that we talked about Refrigeration at length and we've talked about Belvac that we've seen there. On our longer cycle businesses MOG, comes to mind DPC, to a certain extent. We would expect to deplete backlog in the second half of the year as, you know, bigger projects roll off and then you build it up. We shipped heavily off of that backlog in MOG and it's not as if we're falling into a hole. So, I think the good news about MOG is, is that despite heavy shipments in Q3, that backlog is not depleting at a high rate, which is \u2013 and that's all 2021 just because of the delivery times in those particular businesses. The balance of the portfolio outside of digital printing is, generally speaking, short cycle.  I mentioned vehicle service group who had an excellent quarter in terms of shipments and operational performance. They've got a little bit of a bad comp in Q4 just because they are running some promotional things last year prior to price increases, but what we're seeing in terms of dealer communication there is very good for 2021. So, I think it's anecdotal, so there's no real general comment for our portfolio this wide, but you know, I think that we're \u2013 the signaling we're getting for 2021 overall is perspective. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. So it's not just a phenomenon where, hey, 4Q is a little weaker and January is awesome, but we don't know anything else about 2021 and [indiscernible]? Richard Tobin : As I mentioned before, I mean, you think about like a business like ESG, right? If they've got backlog for 2021 deliveries, we could make the product in Q4, which positive absorption, negative working capital. I've got confidence in that business to build that product in 2021 and meet the delivery date. So, to us, as we've always done around here, Q4 is about cash generation and setting ourselves up for 2021. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then I noticed another automation project announced in precision components, any more, I guess, kind of, you know, spread of automation or, you know, kind of evangelizing some of the technology out there across the portfolio that we should expect beyond precision components? And I guess Refrigeration, is that something that could be kind of the next wave of cost reduction? Richard Tobin : There's a few of our businesses that lend themselves to increased automation. As we mentioned, during the Pumps and Process Solution Virtual Investor Day that our expectation is to get on a cadence of doing more of those rather than the tour de force on the portfolio. So, one of the things that we're discussing is we have two big projects, one of which is completed in vehicle services group and one that is under construction around that that we would expect is a candidate to do some more investor outreach in Q1 of 2021. Josh Pokrzywinski : Right, thanks. I'll leave it there. Operator : Your final question today will come from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Yes, thanks for squeezing me in. There's not a whole lot to run through here, but just go back to Belvac, you know, is the [trends] seen in, you know, in can manufacturing is \u2013 the flip side of that, that we face some structural headwinds in chemicals plastics, polymers going forward, you know, so therefore some of the weakness we've seen in [indiscernible] is more structural than just typical? Richard Tobin : You know, Nigel, I'm sure when I talk about Belvac, the guys at Belvac listen and chuckle to themselves how little I know about can making. So, for me to bridge that over into the chemical world on PET, I think you're going to have to ask somebody else. Based on what we hear from our customers, both the can makers on the machinery and from the bottlers in terms of the design portion of the can making, we believe that there's a structural change underway, how that impacts PET demand, I\u2019ll leave it up to the chemical producers to answer that. Nigel Coe : Fair enough. That's a good answer. And then, just quickly on the heat exchangers. I think you sell into both commercial and industrial markets, I think you caught up couple of times, you know, you've seen uptick in heat exchangers where specifically you see enough strength in the markets? Richard Tobin : More on the heat pump side than anything else. That's where our particular strength is and that is where we are in the midst of completing some material capacity expansions. If you know anything about that market, the size of these heat exchangers is getting very large because these are pretty huge systems that are being installed specially on the back of European legislation. So that's really where the demand function for us is coming from. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Dollar provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. We want to remind everyone that our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to uncertainties and risks, including the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and our customers, suppliers, employees, operations, business, liquidity and cash flow. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the first -- for the quarter and for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law. And with that, I will turn this call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin on Slide 3. Order trends have remained positive across the majority of our portfolio since September, and we had a strong finish to the year. Our year-over-year backlog is up 21% as a result of general recovery trends across the portfolio, a meaningful increase in the CFRE segment backlog and some recognition from our customers that raw material costs and supply chain constraints are becoming more challenging into 2021, driving preorders in some markets.  Revenue at $1.8 billion was flat versus the comparable period. Adjusted segment operating margin at 17.1% was flat despite unfavorable revenue mix during the quarter. For the full year, revenue was down 6% and adjusted segment margin up to 16.7% as a result of structural cost savings, center-led strategic initiatives, tight cost controls offsetting the impact of fixed costs under absorption. As we discussed at length in Q3, we are driving towards a strong cash flow performance in the fourth quarter, and we got it, with full year free cash flow increasing 24% over 2019, achieving 14% of revenue. This is what we would expect to happen as we liquidate working capital in excess of lost profits impact, and as a result of efficiency gains from our back office consolidation program.  With that backdrop, we look into 2021 with conservative optimism. Our order book is solid, albeit with a different mix as compared to last year, with DFRE having a material positive impact to the top and bottom line in '21. We are executing on many initiatives other than structural cost takeout that are expected to deliver margin improvements, which I'll cover later in the presentation.  With that, we are initiating full year guidance of 5% to 6% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $6.25 to $6.45. I'll not spend a lot of time on Slide 4, which is a more detailed overview of the results of the quarter. So let's move to Slide 5.  Engineered Products revenue declined on lower shipments in CapEx levered markets such as industrial winches, waste handling equipment and vehicle services. ESG had a tough Q4 comparable to overcome and VSG was coming off a strong Q3, so the performance was largely expected, both have strong backlogs into 2021. And the Aerospace & Defense business had a strong quarter that ended a record year for the business, and demand in industrial automation has shown robust recovery contributing to our backlog as global auto sequentially ramps production. In Fueling Solutions, as we discussed at the end of Q3, the comparable benchmark for Q4 was tough. Despite the top line pressure, the segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on lower volume as our as our productivity actions remain durable.  We are beginning to see the mix benefits from our Helix and Anthem dispenser products, which we believe are winning in the marketplace. We completed the acquisition of Innovation Control Systems in the fourth quarter, which is a great addition to our vehicle launch platform. ICS is a leading supplier of access, payment and site management solutions and software, which fits into our strategy of driving long-term value from the large installed base of retail fuel sites, which we presented in October.  Sales in Imaging & Identification declined 3% organically, the core market and coating business grew on continued healthy demand for consumables and improvement in demand for principal equipment, with particularly healthy activity in the United States. Digital textile printing CapEx remains slow, but we began seeing recovery in demand for consumables and small format machines, which are likely harbingers of conditions normalizing in 2021. Imaging & Identification is our highest gross margin segment. The marketing and coating business has delivered commendable margin performance this year holding the profit line virtually unchanged. However, decrementals and textile printing on lower volumes weighed on the segment margins in Q4 and during the full year, we expect this to begin reversing progressively into 2021.  Pumps & Process Solutions returned to top line in the fourth quarter on strong growth in biopharma, medical and hygienic applications. We also began seeing cyclical recovery in industrial pumps which posted growth after several soft quarters. Compression components in aftermarket continued to be slow, but recent trends in natural gas and LNG markets gives us grounds for optimism going forward. The fourth quarter closed off a solid margin performance in this segment, with margins expanding 150 basis points in Q4 and 220 basis points for the full year. This was driven by broad-based productivity efforts, cost controls, favorable mix and well-timed capacity expansion in biopharma and medical, which we highlighted earlier in the year.  Refrigeration & Food Equipment posted 13% organic growth, with all businesses except Food Service Equipment delivering the increase. A significant portion of the growth came from the well-advertised strength in can making. We are also very encouraged by activity in core food retail market, which grew organic top line at high single digits in the quarter, driven by the continued strength in the door case product line, where we saw double-digit growth for the full year. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in heat pumps and residential applications as well as refrigerated, transport and industrial applications like semiconductors and data centers.  Margin performance effectively improved, supported by volume and actions we took in the middle of 2020. Absolute earnings increased 71% in the quarter over the comparable period. This margin before, coupled with the upcoming ramp-up of automated case line and food retail, positions us to deliver material margin expansion in 2021.  I'll pass it to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6. On the top is the revenue bridge. Our top line continued its recovery, with sequential improvement in organic revenue over Q3. Several of our businesses, including short-cycle industrial pumps and heat exchanges, returned to positive growth in the quarter, while biopharma, aerospace and defense, marketing and coding, food retail and can making continued their positive growth trajectory from prior quarters.  FX benefited the top line by 2% or $34 million, driven principally by a strengthening of the euro against the dollar. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $12 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters.  Revenue breakdown by geography reflects sequential improvement in each major geography, except -- with the exception of Asia. The U.S., our largest market, posted a 1% organic decline in the quarter, an improvement over the 4% decline in Q3 on progressively improving order rates and a strong quarter in biopharma, marking coding, food retail and can making, among others. Europe declined 3% organically, driven by retail fueling and a difficult comparable quarter in vehicle services, though partially offset by continued strength in several of our Pumps & Process Solutions businesses.  All of Asia was down 11% organically, driven principally by China, which was down 16% organically. This result in China was not unexpected as we continue to face headwinds in retail fueling due to the expiration of the underground equipment replacement mandate.  Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 2% organically, reflecting the continued momentum we see across our businesses. In the quarter, we saw organic growth in 4 out of our 5 segments. The fifth segment, fueling solutions, faced a difficult comparable quarter in the prior year, as previously discussed. Overall, our backlog is currently up approximately $300 million or 21% higher compared to this time last year, positioning us well as we enter 2021.  Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide 7. We delivered improved sequential results in the quarter after a significant decline in Q2 and a recovery in Q3. On the top chart, adjusted segment EBIT and margin were both essentially flat year-over-year as we -- as continued productivity initiatives offset negative organic growth and dilutive impact of FX on margins.  Going to the bottom chart, adjusted net earnings declined $1 million as higher taxes and corporate expense offset improved segment EBIT. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits, was approximately 21.4% for the year compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $8 million in the quarter and $22 million for the year, or approximately $4 million lower than in 2019. As we move into 2021, excluding the impact of discrete taxes, we expect the effective tax rate to remain essentially the same as 2020, at about 21.5%. Rightsizing and other costs were $21 million in the quarter, or $17 million after-tax, relating to several new permanent cost, containment initiatives and other items that we executed at the end of 2020.  Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash performance in 2020, with full year free cash flow of $939 million, a $181 million or 24% increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 21% of revenue for the fourth quarter, historically our highest cash flow quarter, and 14% for the full year, a significant increase over the prior year. The call of last quarter's -- last quarter's earnings call, we decided to prioritize prudent working capital management over fixed cost absorption to close out the year, and you can see the value delivered in our year-over-year working capital comparison. We have strong revenue visibility into Q1 and confidence in our team's ability to match industrial production with improved customer demand.  With that, I'll turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Okay. Thanks, Brad. I'm on Page 9. Let me take a few moments to give you an update on our center-led initiatives that we outlined in our strategic plan in September of 2019. While we could have not expected but transpired in 2020, we posited at the time that our portfolio had through-cycle durability and that there were opportunities to drive synergies from our diverse portfolio to improve profitability over time. Despite this, we often hear a notion that Dover is a cost-out story, likely because we give measurable structural cost saving goals each year, implying a finite nature to such endeavor.  There's a lot more than cost reductions to our improvement journey, and we continue to reinvest a portion of the savings, so we'll give you a short update on where we are on these strategic initiatives. True in 2019, we began with the rightsizing of our SG&A base after a significant portfolio change. This was necessary and required immediate intervention. Since then, the improvements have been driven by steady productivity and structural cost actions by our operating units, and from our investments in 4 core enterprise capabilities that generate very attractive return on investment and can be leveraged across the portfolio. The investments are substantial. By the end of this coming year, the headcount involved that center-led enterprise capabilities will have increased by over 50%. These are transformational initiatives touching every quarter of our global portfolio and delivering real results that you can see in our bottom line, and there is significant runway to drive value. We are investing in the following 4 enterprise capabilities, and I'll highlight a few results, but I would encourage you to review the stats in the slides.  First, Dover Digital on Slide 10. This work began in 2017 and accelerate in 2018 with the opening of our Dover Digital Center in Boston. We have over 100 e-commerce connected product and software experts dedicated to this event. This team helps our business lever each commerce at scale and improve the customer journey with ease of doing business as well as back end efficiency for sales and order entry. For example, this year, we target to reach a run rate of $1 billion of revenue processed through digital channels much of which is service parts and catalog items compared to $100 million in 2019. This team also helps our business connect their products and enhance their offerings, which we'll progressively highlight in future presentations as we did for fueling solutions recently.  This is a multiyear journey, value creation journey, and we are very excited about what lies ahead for our digital team.  Moving to Slide 11. Our Operations Center of Excellence is a central team of domain knowledge experts that delivers health and safety, supply chain management, lean operations and advanced manufacturing and automation. This team is instrumental in driving value through rooftop consolidation and automation projects. As you know, we have a number of these in the works. We are also excited about the results of the early lean initiatives spearheading. This is another multiyear journey that we continue -- we will continue to deliver results. Moving on to Slide 12 is our central back office system, which we call Dover Business Services. We've been at this for several years, and we're still in the early innings of expanding the scale and scope of this capability. By centralizing and offshoring transactional back office facilities, we multiply efficiency through scale, technology leverage and unit cost arbitrage. DBS is and will remain an integral part of our margin enhancement story.  And lastly, moving to Slide 3. The India innovation center is more than 600 person strong team that our operating companies can leverage for product engineering, digital solutions development, data information management, research and development and intellectual property services. The scale and expertise of this team allows our operating companies to tap resources that would have been unaffordable to them as stand-alone companies. And allows for concurrent engineering on time-sensitive projects.  So let's sum this up on Slide 14. We laid out 4 pillars of our strategy in 2019, and have been delivering through cycle. We have maintained our focus on margin improvement and continue to invest despite the economic difficulties of 2010. Our end market exposures, coupled with the strategic R&D investments we are delivering attractive growth profile. We are committed to reinvesting in our businesses as a top priority and capital allocation to maintain competitiveness, fuel growth and improve productivity.  We are making good strides on the inorganic front. Finally, we're staying disciplined in our capital allocation by returning excess capital to our shareholders via growing dividends and share repurchases. Moving to 15, where does this leave us going into 2021? We believe that our playbook offers us a significant runway to continue delivering attractive through-cycle returns through mid-single-digit top line growth, steady margin expansion, healthy cash conversion and disciplined capital allocation and shareholder-friendly capital return posture.  Okay. I'll step off the soapbox, and let's move on to 16. We expect demand in engineered products to rebound in 2021. We have seen strong bookings recently in vehicle services and industrial automation, with relevant automotive and vehicle usage statistics trending in the right direction. Bookings have also improved to retain in waste handling, and we are nearly fully booked for the first quarter. Municipal demand will remain uncertain, but we see strong trends in the parts and digital business. As we previewed in November, we expect fueling solutions to have a modest organic growth year. There is known headwind from EMV roll off in the U.S., but there are a number of positives [indiscernible].  We are encouraged by the prospects of our new Anthem user interface solution offering. We expect robust growth in our systems and software business, where we will be launching the industry-first cloud platform developed. We also see good setup for vehicle wash and are excited about having ICs in our portfolio. We expect Imaging & Identification to perform well this year. Marketing & Coading saw a limited downside in 2020, and we've been on a good trajectory in recent quarters despite the tough comp in Q1 due to COVID-driven consumable stocking. This further improvement in services travel restriction subside and activity and serialization software is also firming up. The biggest factor in this segment is, of course, the digital textile printing unit. Our initial read is for the recovery to take place in the second half of the year, that printers will be ramping up production for 2020 apparel collections.  Pumps & Process Solution is expected to have another solid year. We expect a robust growth in biopharma and hygienic applications, the continued recovery trend in industrial pumps, plastics and polymers is expected to deliver steady performance with a comparable basis to the second half bias to the second half. Precision components is likely to experience a slower start to the year, and we're still comping versus last year's first quarter, that saw robust upstream and downstream activity. And finally, we expect a very strong year in Refrigeration & Food Equipment. The core food retail business is operating with a strong backlog and the order trajectory has been healthy in the last few quarters. We expect retailers that have paused their remodel programs last year amidst the pandemic to restart these strategic initiatives, and we are well positioned to participate in that activity. Additionally, we see a good outlook for natural refrigerant systems, both in Europe and also in the U.S. California was the first state to recently mandate transition to natural refrigerant systems. We were the pioneers in the space, and we are very well positioned to capitalize on the sustainability trend in the industry. Belvac, as you know, is working through a record backlog and is booked for the year. Our heat exchanger business also exited 2020 with a record backlog instructive order trajectory across multiple verticals. This will result in material margin improvement in this segment on the back of the case production automation project, higher volumes, positive business mix.  We've covered most of the items on the earlier slides, but I summarize them here in this slide for your reference. As usual, before I wrap up, I'd like to thank everyone at Dover for their work and continued perseverance during this last year. The Dover team has delivered strong results in its difficult conditions. I commend all of our employees were doing that part. And Andrey, with that, let's move on Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : A lot of good additional information there. But just let me dig into like a couple of things, if I could, Rich. First, interesting what you said about kind of pre ordering are you able to fully protect yourself with price and hedging and other things on that type of activity that you're seeing from your customers? Richard Tobin : Yes. Look, Jeff, I mean, I think we've got a couple of challenges going to Q1. Raw material prices are moving up. And there is a lot of constraint in logistics right now. I think that it's been going on somewhat through the fourth quarter. And it looks to be getting tighter going into the first quarter as economic activity moves up. So the bad news is, we're going to have to deal with those constraints, and we're going to have to be on the front foot in terms of offsetting raw mats in terms of whether it's either pricing or productivity. But I think that my comment about the backlog, it is influencing demand in the backlog because, I think, that there's beginning a recognition out there of, \"I've got to get my orders in because of these constraints.\" I mean, it's -- look at what's going on in auto, just as a precursor to that.  So I don't think it's bad in a way, and I don't think it's negative for us in terms of people placing orders in advance of raw material costs because, I think, that we've got some levers to pull there, and it's really short-cycle at the end of the day. The good news is, I think, to the extent that our backlogs go up from an S&OP process, we can plan more appropriately, and that drives efficiency at the factory level floor. So probably going to be a little bit of an interest in Q1, but I think, overall, it's not insurmountable. Jeffrey Sprague : Right. And then just shifting to the DFRE. So it looks like you'll have the volumes here to fully kind of exercise the automation project. I suppose you don't want to get into margins by segments here. But can you give us a little color on how the margin should play out in that business? And is there any kind of -- other than kind of the normal seasonal peak that we'll be looking at? Any other kind of noise or movement in the margin trajectory there? Richard Tobin : No. I would expect that the margins to comp well every quarter, but the seasonality of those margins to remain intact. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with Jpmorgan. Charles Tusa : I think with the lots of buzzwords, Rich, not used to you kind of like topping at that high level about corporate strategy. But I think the message is that there's something like a little bit more sustainable than just like a couple of years of cost cuts than noticeable to me was the 25% to 35% incremental margin guide. And then the 11% to 13% of revenue in free cash flow in a year where I'll be growing pretty strongly. So basically, you should see some headwind. It shouldn't be like a great cash year, for example. I think, back in 2019, in the fall, you said 25% to 30% incrementals and 8% to 12% free cash as a percentage of sales. Are these kind of like sustainable step-ups that you'd hope to deliver over time as part of the earnings and cash algorithm? Richard Tobin : Yes. Look, at the end of the day, we expect to be pulling on both levers, consistent margin expansion and cash flow productivity. So productivity and the working capital item. Bottom line is, as we've been saying all year, we would expect with the headwind that we'd be liquidating our balance sheet as we should in a difficult environment on the revenue side. We will have a working capital build because we've got a pretty robust revenue forecast going into '21. But do I think it's going to make our metrics worse? Not demonstrably so because I think that we're going to get the benefit of the margin expansion. And I don't expect to deteriorate at all in terms of working capital as a percent of sales. Charles Tusa : And I would guess -- I mean, I look at that 11% to 13% of revenues. I mean, it's not like your CapEx is actually above what I would expect it to be. I mean, is the $175 million to $200 million now a sustainable run rate? Or is that something that you push some projects out of '20 into '21? Because I think you guys are planning on that coming down a bit that there were some temporary projects. What's the outlook for CapEx for the next couple of years? Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean, we've got two new transformational projects underway, one in vehicle Services group, and one in ESG, which -- look, at the end of the day, they're not nearly the same scale of the new building that we did at CPC, and what we did at DFR, but it's the same logic. I mean, it's automating what we're pretty manual processes. So we think that we're going to get a relatively quick payback in terms of the margin expansion there. It's early in the year. I think that we've tended to always forecast a higher CapEx number that actually gets delivered. That number looks reasonable considering we've got 2 bigger projects. But -- so I don't want to take the number down right now or say it's an anomaly, but experience would say that it's probably a little bit high. Charles Tusa : Right. But I mean, if you do 11% to 13% of revenue, even with that, it's not that bad. Just 1 quick one. You guys had talked about, I think, $25 million of temporary cost reversals as a headwind in can you just give us an update on that number, if there's anything that's coming back relative to what you did last year to protect the margins? Richard Tobin : There's nothing I look. At the end of the day, we'll be building. We've got estimates of building it back some incentive comp and a variety of other things. But look, it's all built into the EPS forecast that we have there. Whatever the pullback of kind of -- let me -- let me answer you this way, right? We had coverage on furloughs, okay? So that was a positive this year because it deferred the cost of us having to take those people out to a certain extent.  What we're going to bring back is going to be absorbed into industrial production in the revenue line. So net-net, that's an indifference. So what we're talking about is general SG&A, And the bigger movements there were T&E and incentive comps. So let's think positive for a moment, the incentive comp comes back, I think, T&E is going to come back. But is it going to reach 2019 levels? No. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with City Group. Andrew Kaplowitz : Rich, with the understanding that we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in R and FE with the backlog that you have in the core food retail business picking up as well as the bell back deliveries ramping up, would you actually say that high single-digit forecast for '21 could even be conservative given the double-digit momentum that you saw in Q4? Richard Tobin : It's a little bit early to... Andrew Kaplowitz : I said we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Richard Tobin : Yes, let's get ahead of ourselves while we're not getting ourselves. Look, you know what, I think that the backlog is a good precursor for delivering the incremental margins that we're looking for from a segment point of view. Our expectation, it's the highest growth segment in our forecast right now. And I'd have to go back to look because it's a margin differential, but it's a material contributor to the EPS expansion. So to the extent the trend continues because this is a relatively short-cycle business, if I just talking about refrigeration now not Belvac. Belvac is booked for the year. So we get more orders for callback, it just gets pushed into 2022, frankly. So DFR, which is generally a short-cycle business, we're covered for Q1 and beginning to get coverage into Q2. Let's get Q1 under our belt before we start moving the number up. But it's -- a lot of the total profit change that we have baked into the EPS is coming from that segment. By the way, and the reason when you could say, well, it's not overly aggressive in terms of the conversion rate. Remember, that's one of our lower-margin businesses so that's going to bring down the consolidated conversion a little bit. We'll take it in terms of absolute profits. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful. And then just in Engineered products, maybe just give us a little more color into what happened in the quarter in Q4? I know you said it was just basically expected to decline. Did you see any inflationary pressure in that segment in the quarter? And how are you thinking about the margin in that segment in '21? Richard Tobin : It's not inflation. I mean, I think that if you go back in Q3, we -- the guys did a fantastic job in VSG of delivering off a backlog that had built during the quarter. So the production performance there was very, very good. And it actually add into Q4 from a comparable point of view. So that's not a problem there. And I mean the weak part of the market, which we've been talking about all year is municipal. And generally speaking, municipal tends to get delivered at the end of the year, so we know that they had a bad comp. Having said that, look, at the end of the day, those are -- that segment is more of our industrial businesses. So that's really where the raw mat headwinds are. And look, we're going to have to work that out between volume price and productivity. But I think, we fully expect, portfolio-wide, to offset all raw material headwinds. Operator : The next question comes from the line of John Inch with Gordon Hafta. John Inch : Chandra. If the economy were to rich really pick up starting, say, in the second half as let's present vaccine rollout is successful. Are you geared to handle what could be a material upsurge in demand? Or would you have to like we have to kind of come up with a plan to sort of debottleneck or expand capacity or bring a bunch of people back. How would that work? Richard Tobin : The only area that we've got real capacity constraint would be in a niche business like Belvac. The balance of the portfolio does not run on even 5-day, 3-shift operations, quite frankly, for the middle part, we're a 6-day a week single shift group here. So to the extent that we have some amount of visibility, and to the extent that as economic activity ramps that the supply chain keeps up with it, which it isn't right now, I don't think that we are capacity constrained in any meaningful thing.  Having said that, I mean, in terms of top line growth, I think that we are expecting economic activity to kind of sequentially ramp through '21 even in our forecast. But are we capacity constrained outside of some of our niche your businesses? No. John Inch : No, that's fair. You just mentioned supply chain, by the way. Are you at a point where you're trying to circumvent this? Or are you letting it wrong to see how it happens? Meaning, I don't know, possibly seek other suppliers, dual sourcing, that sort of thing? Or is it still sort of too early to tell? Richard Tobin : No, no. We're doing everything under our power to get beyond this because whether that is buying raw materials forward because into the increase in curve on plates deal or sheet metal or something like that, which we're doing. We've been giving guidance to all of our operating companies that, from a working capital perspective, if they need to build at the beginning of the year and bleed it off in the second half of the year, we take the production performance and the efficiency of that rather than getting it to stop/start kind of scenario. And then there are certain a lot of the pinch points forget kind of logistics with container freight and everything else, some of the pinch points on electronic components. We're fighting it out with everybody else. John Inch : Okay. No, that makes sense. Maybe -- maybe just lastly here. I'm actually really intrigued by the attention you put toward India, business services and so forth and deservedly so. If tower were a substantially larger company, would efficiencies in the initiatives like the Dover business services exponentially compound, I mean, you're not a huge company, right? So if you were, all of a sudden, to do M&A and become a lot larger, would sort of those benefits accrue as a compounded basis or prospectively at a linear basis? It's almost like can these things that you're creating serve to create for mechanisms to justify why Dover should actually continue to expand into adjacencies to create shareholder value? Richard Tobin : Well, look, the reason that we're doing it is, as we said all along that Dover's reason to exist is to bring services at scale that are kind of our smaller companies would not be able to do on their own.  Having said that, as we build -- as we build those services, we're not even beginning to scratch the surface of the leverage that we get. Because the fact of the matter is, despite the robust trend and growth that we have, we're continuing to reinvest. At a certain point, you've built enough scale that bringing on another 100,000 transactions doesn't require you to build out anything more. So you flip over in terms of the benefit of that leverage.  Now having said that, we have a variety of conversations around here about being a compounder and doing something on the inorganic side. This is clearly an asset for us to extract synergy value of anything that we were to buy. Operator : Appreciate it. Next question will come from the line of Scott Davis from Numis Research Research. Scott Davis : Scott, Rich, can you give us a little bit more color on retail fueling in China. And just are we still decelerating? Are we kind of at a new normal demand level? Richard Tobin : All right. Yes, that works. Thanks, Andre. I think this is the last bad comp for us. Which was on that double-wall issue. But having said that, the volume that we see out of, primarily, the NOx in China has been pretty low. We don't -- we had a big conversation around here the other day whether that's because of -- is the volume down, and we're missing out on it? Or is the volume just down? We've gone out to all of our traditional customers in China. We still rate very well in terms of the purchasing programs. I just think that, for whatever reason that 2020 was a down cycle in terms of kind of the NOC build-out of their retail operations. Early to say whether that recovers, and that's not really built into our forecast for '21. But at some point, it's going to have to. Scott Davis : Okay. Fair enough. And then just as a follow-up, I mean, you talked a little about inventories, but it's hard to say, just given the diversity of your businesses, of course, but are inventories back to normal, you would say, at the customer level, as we've heard below term line inventories for several quarters now, so was back to normal in on double ordering? Richard Tobin : Unfortunately, it's 1 of these. It depends, Scott answers. We have businesses like our industrial pumps business that sells through stocking distributors are early reads here in January is there's an amount of restocking going on because our backlogs and the industrial businesses there are building the same thing with material handling. Those backlogs are building. So I think it's fair to say that everybody is very prudent in terms of inventories on the distribution side. In '20, they -- now everybody is trying to make two calls. What is economic activity going to be in '21?  And the second thing I mentioned of if there are going to be supply constraints as everybody ramps sequentially, do I got to get on the front foot and get my orders in because there's a potential that some of those deliveries are going to be delayed outside of the quarter. So there's really two of those phenomenons going on. Do I think that they're severely under stock? No. But I think that, by and large, our stocking distributors are going to stock-based on what they think that the revenue is going to be and -- which is built into our forecast. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a first question around any margin color by segment you can give. I see the $25 million to $35 million guide firm ahead of incremental margins. Any segments to call out being extreme ends of that spectrum? And maybe just to find a point, in DFS, should we expect operating margins to grow this year? Or that might be a challenge because of the EMV mix headwind? Richard Tobin : There is plurality in terms of incremental margin with the exception of Engineered products, which would be slightly lower. So let's discuss why, right? The Engineered products is going to be slightly lower just because of the gross margin within that segment. And despite the fact that DRFE has lower gross margins at the segmental level, the revenue growth there is so high that you're getting a pretty big impact in terms of absorption benefit year-over-year. So, now, having said that, we do have structural cost savings that are rolling through at the same time, and that depends segment by segment. But I think that my comments here are -- I think you've got your finger on it for DFS because it's a relatively low growth environment, and it is a little bit negative because of the mix, but we think that we can make that up and do the product 3. So then the hierarchy would be Engineered products, the lowest and then the plurality, again, across the rest of the portfolio. Julian Mitchell : Great. Then see the full year guide across the firm. Just wondered perhaps the first quarter, maybe just talk about orders and bookings in recent weeks? And should we expect the first quarter to look maybe a little better than Q4 in terms of year-on-year revenue and margin, but not substantially different until Q2? Richard Tobin : I think the answer is yes, but that is a calculation that I have not done around here. I can just tell you that what you would expect is the toughest comp is Q1 to Q1 just because it's pre-pandemic to entering into '21, but we expect it to be better vis-\u00e0-vis Q1. Clearly, Q2 comp is going to be a relatively low bar to hurdle. And then the back end of the year is going to be as we mentioned during the color on the segments that we have certain businesses that we believe are back-end loaded, either because of seasonality or based on where they are in the recovery of those markets. So we expect to be better in Q1, everybody is going to be better in Q2, and then regular seasonality from there. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question. You're definitely sort of starting to find all cylinders when it comes to operational storage is starting to deliver consistently on the operational algorithm. But can you just talk about how is your strategy on capital allocation, and, specifically, M&A is evolving going forward? And what kind of opportunities should we be thinking for 2021? And well, how it in terms of availability? Richard Tobin : I think that the hierarchy, we've been over a variety of different times, so that's unchanged. I think in terms of opportunity, there's plenty out there, and a lot of it is very expensive for all the reasons that we've talked about. We're on the front foot, actually spent more if you go, I don't know the slide number was, we spent more in '20 versus '19. Andrew Obin : That's exactly right. Richard Tobin : Right. Yes. We tried to spend a lot more than that, quite frankly, but couldn't get it done because of valuation or a variety of different things. So look, I'm very confident in, as you described it, the operational algorithm here. I think that this is just a roll forward of what we've done for the last couple of years. So our confidence of converting revenue into incremental margin is quite high. I think we have a lot of businesses that have earned the right to grow inorganically. We just got to find the targets and execute on them without getting crazy. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a follow-up, I think John has asked you about the supply chain. But how has your thinking about the supply chain has evolved throughout the COVID sort of pandemic? You manage it very well, but anything different that you guys are going to do going forward in terms of where you're sourcing? And I know it's at extension of John's question, but maybe more color. Richard Tobin : Look, I mean, we're not -- our supply chains are relatively discrete. So any moves that we make are -- we're not auto OEM, and we have to make strategic decisions based on geopolitics and foreign currency and things like that. So we're changing it all the time to a certain extent. I think that the trade of buying low-value, high commodity price exposure, basic metal working out of Asia and bringing back to the U.S., I think that, that has been dying for a couple of years now, part and parcel of the reason that we're making some investments into VSG and ESG right now because we think that we can be more competitive and get the industrial absorption of doing it ourselves to a certain extent. But we're not we're not making big strategic decisions and not making big swings, but we're always trying to adapt the supply chain. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : On maybe following on that last question, your comments around being front footed on M&A. Maybe just the flip side of that argument, given where valuation levels are right now, you could argue maybe there hasn't been a better time to looking at the portfolio closer in terms of maybe unlocking value on assets that you don't expect to be part of the portfolio longer term. So maybe just some thoughts on that, and how you're thinking about that specifically for 2021? Richard Tobin : Joe, it's not changed. I mean we're constantly revisiting a variety of pieces of the portfolio. And that's really all I can say about it at the end of the day, right? We may have views on individual pieces, but we don't want that to get in the way of us extracting the maximum value that we can out of the pieces that we have. So I spent a lot of time here in terms of portfolio construction on both -- and more on the in and then the out. But we screen all of our businesses for their participation strategy and changes in the marketplace and everything else, not so much, \"Hay, wait a minute, everybody is paying a lot for things.\" So maybe we should go to market. We look at it more as in terms of its hierarchy in terms of return on invested capital in the cup and whether they are advantaged or disadvantaged structurally over the next time horizon. Joseph Ritchie : Yes. That makes sense, and I don't mean this to be a perfect segue, but I did want to talk about food retail to some degree. You talked last quarter about the fact that margins have gotten back to the low teens, remodeling had restored. I guess, how do we take the comments around like backlog and whether that backlog is building because it's been potentially more difficult to continue on the remodeling at this point given the current coronavirus cases surging? Just want to get a better understanding for whether you're getting on-premise access. And then secondly, how the margins have kind of even trended given being on the third quarter for the food retail business? Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean, we're expecting big things from the retail food business this year. For sure, a lot of the deferments that happened because of COVID access and a variety of other forces are clearly what's building the backlog into '21. But having said that, we've gone through a 4.5- to 5-year cycle where there hasn't been even, we would argue, replacement or maintenance spending in terms of food retail. So there is some pent-up demand there. We think that we have a more competitive product now. We're changing the cost structure of that product.  And as we talked about before, our view is that what the customers really value in this business is being able to have the product available when they want it. And to the extent that now we've changed -- are changing the dynamic of our lead times, I think that's beginning to be reflected in our backlog. So this is expense. The management team of this business has spent 2.5 years, working real hard to transform this business. And our expectations in terms of profitability this year is material in terms of what's baked into our EPS. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : We have covered a lot of ground already. So I really want to talk about the sort of the frame of FY '21 you have layed out. And what struck me was your revenue growth range of 5% to 6% is quite tight and it implies good visibility, maybe some considers them. That's a good sort of a question. And the second is your range for margins, 25% to 35%, is quite a bit wide than we normally see. So we normally see more precision on margins and that's revenues in your vice versa. So I wonder if you could maybe point on that. And the width of the margin range, is that a function of portfolio mix primarily? Or is there just some insertion the raw material? Any color there would be helpful? Richard Tobin : Yes. Nigel. I mean, look, I would expect that we are going to tighten both those changes progressively as we go through the year. But I mean, you've got your finger on it. I mean, we're predicting even if we go to the organic revenue, which doesn't have that mix, the margin does have FX in it. So we're predicting FX in advance of 12 months and predicting mix over a wide diverse portfolio in terms of gross margin. So we need to give ourselves a little bit of latitude there. As I mentioned in the previous question before, the good news is that refrigeration is coming back and in terms of absolute profits, it's going to be material to the bottom line. That's not really great in terms of consolidated conversion margin just because of the of the EBIT margin of that particular business. So if you go back to the question, I think, that was just asked before, well, could that revenue be higher?  Are we at an inflection point because there's really going to be -- and we're under forecasting refrigeration for the year. In a way, I hope we are. What that's going to do is push up the top line, but it's going to draw down the conversion margin, but we'll take the absolute profit. So it's our best guess right now. I guess, at the beginning of the year, we like to give us some latitude. I think that the history around here has been to try to hit the top, and we've caught every intention of trying to do so. Nigel Coe : And then my follow-on is really the comment around the prebuy in PRAs or preordering because of supply change constraints, which makes total sense, and we're certainly hearing about supply chain constraints. But are you getting this feedback from customers? Is it your gut instinct telling you that this is happening? And therefore, should we expect there to be maybe a moderation in order rates in 1Q sort of as a consequence of that 4Q dynamic? Richard Tobin : It is my gut feeling. We have a President -- operating company presidents meeting as soon as we finish up with your question, and that's one of the things we're digging into. But based on what we're seeing, in our own operations and the guidance that we are giving our own operations of, if you're seeing constraints out there, you better get on the front foot and start buying components to the detriment of working capital, which we know we can bleed off of the balance of the year, let's not miss out on deliveries and production performance. So if we're doing it, my expectation is that everybody is doing it. So I think it's to the detriment of order rates through the balance of the year? No, I don't. Because I think the backed in -- look, there's always going to be volatility quarter-by-quarter. But what's baked into our revenue forecast is shipments, for lack of better word. If there's some amount of -- and look, at the end of the day, you get a backlog that's in access to your first quarter production, you're probably not going to get it out anyway. So the good news, I think when I answered sprague before is, you know what, the longer -- the bigger the backlog that we have, the more efficiently we should be able to run our factories, and that's margin accretive. Operator : The last question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Market. Deane Dray : Would be interested in hearing what the dynamics are around that natural refrigerant, Rich, that you called out, can your equipment be used for that? Does it have to be retrofit? And how do you think this trend develops from here? Richard Tobin : Well, we did a press release on it not too long ago. So you can see our view based on what the ruling for California was. We are a leader in the systems business in Europe, and Europe is probably 3 to 5 years ahead of the United States. So we have the technology. It's now going to be a question of what the adoption rates and where they are regulatory mandated or individual retail operations want to as part of ESG go green and begin adapting those solutions. So we feel really good about our position in terms of having the technology readily available. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just a second question unrelated. If the new administration is part of the stimulus program puts through some restrictions about buy American products, how is Dover's position just broadly if that restriction comes through? Richard Tobin : I don't think it would be materially beneficial. Generally speaking, we've make and ship in the jurisdiction that we operate in as an overall comment. Deane Dray : Could you be flexible in terms of your supply chain in terms of doing some sub as kind of lays in the U.S. to qualify? Just the last time just went through, that's what we saw companies were speaking on the on side. Richard Tobin : Yes. I think that if we were a big, vertically-integrated operation, yes, I think that there would be more of a challenge. We don't -- we won't bring in assemble product of any grand scale that you can break apart in containers and put value-added on that. I mean, I've been through this previous life. Yes -- look, at the end of the day, I don't think it's going to move the needle for us. The only thing that comes to mind is if we were a component part and somebody wants to source into the United States and had been sourcing -- and been importing. Is that an opportunity? I guess, sure. I wouldn't have any idea how to scale it right now, though.

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrey Galiuk, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrey Galiuk. Please go ahead, sir. Andrey Galiuk : Thank you, Laurie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. This call will be available for playback through May 4 and the audio portion of this call will be archived on our website for three months.  Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website.  We want to remind everyone that our comments today may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to uncertainties and risks, including the impact of COVID-19 on the global economy and our customers, suppliers, employees, operations, business, liquidity and cash flow. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the first quarter for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.  With that, I will turn this call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thank you, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. We have a big group this morning. So we're going to have a robust Q&A session.  So, let's move to page three. The business challenge moving into Q1 was twofold for Dover. First, we exited 2020 with a healthy backlog of business which we needed to operationally deliver against. Back end, we had to work closely with our distributors and customers to seize opportunities in the marketplace despite a complex set of challenges with raw materials, components, logistics and labor availability. We are pleased with our first quarter performance on both counts, which is reflected in our robust revenue growth and the increase in our order backlog as we move into Q2.  Let's take a look at the metrics. Total revenue is up 13%, 9% organic to the comparable period. Clearly, the quarter benefited from a good order, backlog position and the willingness of the channels to receive product deliveries as market demand accelerated, resulting in the highest volume quarter since 2014 and the largest first quarter volume since 2012 for the company. This performance is a clear indication that our product portfolio is attractive and often underappreciated growth avenues and that the work that we have done on operational excellence is gaining traction.  Order rates outpaced revenue in the quarter, posting bookings of $2.3 billion, a 27% comparable organic increase. The growth was broad based with all five segments contributing to the increase. This resulted in the seasonally high backlog of $2.2 billion, an increase of 39%.  Since our earnings are issued among the first in the industrial sector, I suppose it's on us to explain the drivers of growth and their impact on seasonality and full-year demand. I'm going to try to be careful with my choice of terms and comments not to cast unwarranted shade on a clearly positive market demand environment.  There are several factors driving healthy customer activity, including pent up demand from last year as a result of low starting channel inventories in certain sectors. As I also mentioned in my opening remarks, this was further influenced by tight supply chains and materials inflation, positively contributing to seasonal demand and backlog build as our customers and channels positioned themselves to meet their forecasted demand.  Importantly, before we get all wound up trying to quantify the impact of channel inventory stocking and inflationary prebuy and how it impacts quarterly demand, let's not lose sight of the fact that total marketplace demand is robust, which is reflected on our backlog and which also leads us to revise our revenue growth guidance upward for the full year to 10% to 12%. So put succinctly, it's not prebuy if we don't remove it from the full year revenue estimates. Still early in the year and we will continue to produce to meet customer demands and watch our backlog and order patterns. We'll have more color on the drivers of demand, and our revenue performance, including contribution of market share gains as we progress through the year.  For now, we are focused on executing operationally in demanding conditions to win in the marketplace. But we clearly believe that favorable demand conditions remain durable through the year.  Let's move to profitability. Q1 was solid with consolidated adjusted segment margin at 19.1%, 320 basis points higher versus the comparable quarter. This was supported by strong volumes, favorable mix of products delivered, positive price [technical difficulty] continued operational discipline and efficiency initiatives, which more than offset input cost headwinds.  Strong profitability and continued focus on working capital management resulted in seasonally strong free cash flow, which was up $110 million compared to last year's first quarter or the comparable period.  With a solid Q1 under our belt, we look at the remainder of 2020 with constructive optimism. Strong order trends and a record backlog portend a robust top line outlook and we have confidence in our team's ability to navigate the supply chain challenges. With that, we are raising our guidance for the year to 10% to 12%, all-in revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $6.75 to $6.85 per share, a substantial step up compared to our prior guidance.  I will skip slide 4 which provides a more detailed overview of our results for the first quarter. So, let's move to slide 5. Engineered Products revenue was up 2% organically as demand conditions improved modestly [technical difficulty] comparable period. Vehicle services entered the year with a strong order book and faced solid demand across all geographies and product lines. Industrial automation grew on automotive recovery and channel restocking and aerospace and defense shipments were solid. The business remains booked well into the second half of the year.  As expected, waste hauling was down year-over-year, given a lower starting backlog entering Q1, which was further impacted by component availability issues that constrain shipments in the quarter. We have forecasted this business to be levered towards H2 and order trends and backlog reflect that. Same dynamic for industrial winches, with revenue down in the quarter, but recovery in order rates. We expect a continued gradual recovery in this business over the year.  Margin performance in the quarter was flat year-over-year as volume leverage and pricing offset the negative fixed cost absorption in the capital goods portion of the portfolio. And Fueling Solutions was up 3% organically in the quarter on the strength of North American retail fueling as well as our software and systems business. Activity in China remained subdued. Order backlogs are up 13% and we expect our hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance driven underground product offerings to contribute positively due to an increase in miles driven and construction seasonality as we make our way through the year. The segment posted another quarter of strong margin performance on higher volumes, productivity actions and mix, which is a continuation of the trajectory that we exited in 2020.  Sales in Imaging & Identification improved 4% organically, the core marking and coding business grew well on strong printer and services demand in North America and Asia, and was partially offset by a decline in consumables against the comparable quarter where customers stocked up on inks at the onset of the pandemic.  We also saw a nice pickup in serialization software sales. Textile printer sales remain soft as global apparel and retail remains impacted by COVID. Ink consumable volumes were up as we significantly improved ink attachment rates and we saw encouraging improvement in the pipeline and new printer sales as the quarter progressed. Margins improved slightly in the segment on higher volumes and we were able to offset material cost inflation with strategic pricing during the quarter.  Pumps & Process Solutions posted 18% organic growth in the quarter on improved volumes across all businesses except precision components. Order rates and shipments for biopharma connectors and pumps continued to be strong. Industrial pumps had a solid quarter, driven by improved end market conditions and distributor demand. And polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year on robust demand in Asia and the US. Precision components was down in the quarter though demand conditions stabilized in hydrodynamic bearings and compression parts, as well as broadly in China through new OEM builds remains impacted.  Adjusted operating margin in the quarter expanded by 890 basis points on strong volume, favorable mix and pricing. This team has moved this segment to best in class top line and bottom line metrics through a dedication to operational excellence, robust product development, and innovation management, and proactive and purposeful inorganic actions. It's a world class collection of assets that we will continue to invest behind.  Refrigeration & Food Equipment continued its solid momentum from the second half of last year, posting 18% organic growth. Revenue on new orders in beverage can making more than doubled year-over-year. Food retail saw broad-based increases across its product lines as key retailers resumed capital investment in product programs, plus we've seen good demand for some of our new product introductions and customer wins. Our natural refrigerant systems business in particular experienced robust demand in Europe and the US as customers are adopting more environmentally friendly solutions. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in Asia and Europe across all end markets. Foodservice equipment was down in the quarter, but saw a stabilization in chain restaurant demand. Despite operational challenges in food retail due to availability issues with insulation raw materials, adjusted margin performance improved by 450 basis points, supported by stronger volumes, productivity initiatives and cost actions we took in the middle of 2020, partially offset by input cost inflation.  I'll pass it to Brad from here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm on slide 6. On the top is the revenue bridge. Our top line benefited from organic growth across all five segments, with particular strength in Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments.  FX benefited top line by 3% or $51 million. Acquisitions more than offset dispositions in the quarter by $15 million. We expect this number to grow in subsequent quarters. The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America, Europe and Asia, our three largest geographic regions. The US, our largest market, posted 7% organic growth in the quarter on solid order rates and retail fueling, marking, coating, biopharma connectors, food retail and can making among others, and was partially offset by delayed shipments and waste hauling.  Europe grew by 13% in the quarter on strong shipments and vehicle aftermarket, biopharma, industrial pumps and heat exchangers. All of Asia returned to growth and was up 20% organically, driven by China, which was up 60% against the COVID impacted comparable quarter in the prior year.  Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 27% organically, reflecting the continued broad-based momentum we are seeing across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic bookings growth across all five segments. Overall, our backlog is currently up $626 million or 39% versus this time last year, positioning us well for the remainder of the year.  Let's go to the earnings bridges on slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted segment. EBIT was up nearly $100 million and margin improved several 100 basis points as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation. Going through the bottom of the chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $60 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher taxes, as well as higher corporate expenses, primarily related to compensation accruals and deal expenses.  The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits was approximately 21.7% for the quarter compared to 21.5% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $6 million in the quarter or approximately $3 million lower than in 2020. Right-sizing and other costs were $4 million in the quarter or $3 million after tax.  Now on slide 8. We were pleased with the cash flow performance in the first quarter with free cash flow of $146 million or $110 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 8% of revenue in the first quarter, which is historically our lowest cash flow quarter due to seasonality of our production. Let me turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Brad. Let's go to slide [technical difficulty]. We expect demand in Engineered Products to improve sequentially through the remainder of the year, which is supported by a robust backlog. We continue to see strong bookings trends in vehicle services and industrial automation. Aerospace and defense have significant revenue visibility through its government programs and is booked well into the second half of the year. Order rates on waste handling improved significantly during the first quarter, though the shipment schedule will be levered towards the second half and we're watching the supply chain here closely, which is a stabilizer we expect a gradual recovery through the second half of the year.  As communicated on our investor meeting in November, we expect Fueling Solutions to post moderate organic growth for the year. There was a known headwind from EMB roll off in the US, but order trends support a number of positives offsetting it, including growth in systems and software, recovery in underground businesses and growth in vehicle wash. We also expect that Asia, China in particular, should stabilize and become a net positive for us in the second half. The ICS acquisition which we closed at the end of last year is off to a very good start as vehicle wash market is recovering healthily. Imaging & ID is expected to perform well this year. Our core marking and coating business, stalwarts in 2020, is expected to continue to deliver low to mid-single digit growth with services and serialization products positively impacting performance.  Digital textile printing remains slow, although we saw a year-over-year improvement in ink tonnage sales in Q1 as we continue executing our strategy to attach consumables to machine sales. We expect recovery here in the second half.  Pumps & Process Solutions should have another solid year. Demand for biopharma and hygienic applications remains robust and trading conditions in industrial pumps rebounded quickly in the first quarter, and momentum should continue. Our recent investments in biopharma capacity were prescient, and we are well positioned to continue capitalizing on the secular growth story.  Plastics and polymers is expected to deliver steady performance as a global shortage of plastic and rubber as well as petrochemical investments are driving increased investment in processing plants. Precision components have stabilized and we expect it to contribute to year-over-year growth again in the second half of the year.  With its large backlog and high order rates, Refrigeration & Food Equipment is expected to have a strong year. New orders in the core food retail businesses have been healthy in the last few quarters as retailers that had paused their remodel programs last year amidst the pandemic are restarting these strategic initiatives.  Additionally, we are capitalizing on our leadership position in natural refrigerant systems both in Europe and also in the US, where we believe the recent mandate in California will foretell a trend among the other 49 states to mandate the transition to more environmentally friendly solutions. We also see good growth in our specialty product line and small format customers segment.  Belvac continues to work through a record backlog and had another significant bookings quarter in Q1. They are booked for the year. Our heat exchanger business is seeing strong order rates across all verticals and geographies. We are investing in capacity and new capabilities in these two businesses and are well positioned to capture growth.  Demand is stabilized in food service equipment at restaurant chains and we expect the institutional business to recover in the second half as students return to schools and traffic improves at stadiums and hotels. Our revised annual guidance is on page 10. We covered the most pertinent of these items [technical difficulty] and we summarized them here for your reference. Finally, slide 11 puts expected 2021 performance in a multi-year perspective. Our 2019 investor presentation, we highlighted how the changes to Dover's portfolio over the prior decade shaped a less cyclical business and provided attractive through cycle returns. 2020 was proof of lower top line cyclicality in a demanding environment and our ability to protect profitability.  Operational excellence and operating margin expansion has been our priority over the last couple of years and we are on track to deliver more than 100 basis points of average margin expansion over that period. And we have the playbook and tools for this to continue. Dover is positioned to deliver attractive double-digit EPS growth, in line with our long-term corporate targets communicated in 2019.  Before wrapping up, I'd like to thank everyone at Dover for their hard work delivering these results and their continued perseverance.  And that's the end of the presentation. So, Andrey, we can open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Steve Tusa : Rich, this is the most excited I've heard you in a while. Way to jump out of your shoes there. The kind of rest of the year guidance, I just wanted to kind of get an idea of \u2013 you mentioned there, these kind of like \u2013 I think they were bookings tailwinds this quarter, but not necessarily revenue tailwinds. But when I look at kind of the rest of the year and I just kind of simply divide the rest of the year guide to quarterly just to get to a quarterly number, and keeping in mind the first quarter is usually like a pretty low number seasonally, it seems like sequentially to the rest of the year quarterly that you have EPS, EBIT kind of softening and actually down sequentially and sales basically kind of flattish for the rest of the year just on a quarterly \u2013 kind of simple quarterly divided by three, rest of the year divided by three. So, is there something like a fundamental that will drop off other than EMB? You'd mentioned a lot of these businesses have a second half that actually looks pretty good. Anything we're missing on this one? Richard Tobin : No. Look, at the end of the day, Q1 was stronger than we expected. So, I think that we're quite pleased in our ability to pivot operationally to get the product out the door. I think that we're probably being arguably conservative to get another quarter under our belt to see how much of that backlog and demand is being influenced by channel restocking and trying to get in front of raw material perceived price increases in the future. And I'm not entirely clear right now how much of Q1 overperformance was taken from Q2, which is seasonally when we kind of ramp. So, it's usually a low Q1, big move in Q2, Q3 and then kind of run for cash in Q4. You just can't do the math and say, well, historically, it's been this percentage of revenue and operating profit and this is what the seasonality is, and if I take Q1 as a proxy and I run my spreadsheet, it kicks out an extraordinarily high number, both on the revenue side and the operating margin side.  So, from the revenue side, I think fair enough, we may be a little conservative. We'd like to see our bookings go through Q2. I'll tell you sitting here in April that it's not deteriorating, which is a good news. So, that portends a pretty decent Q3 that we've got coming up, but we'd like to see how that develops over time.  Because make no mistake, there's a couple of things here. Operationally, it is getting kind of difficult out there in terms of sourcing raw materials, labor availability, a variety of different things out there. We had some headwinds in the first quarter, but I'll tell you that operationally, we plowed through. We're not out of the woods yet. Right now, we missed shipments in both ESG and in retail refrigeration because of component availability. I don't really know yet whether that's going to get better or worse.  My final comment, and I know this is a long answer, but you're at the head of the line and this is going to be the question we knew we were going to get, is from a margin point of view, and I think that I discussed this at the end of 2020, the incremental margin expectation for Q2, because the comp is so good, has been overstated on margin because of our ability to use furlough mechanisms that were subsidized by the government, meaning we can take production people off of our payroll because we had subsidies in place to account for it. So, you actually have a snap back of costs. Now, we're in pretty good shape because our revenue is up so much, so we should be able to absorb it. But I think, by and large, what I've seen that there's an expectation in industrial world where the incremental in Q2 margin performance is a lot higher than we would expect.  The second answer on the margin performance in the balance of the year is we really expect to accelerate in refrigeration over the balance of the year. So, we've got this big backlog. It's up to us to get it out. So, out of the growth that we expect in the balance of the year, a lot more of that growth is going to \u2013 from refrigeration than it was in Q1. And as you know, that is dilutive to margins as they go forward. So, I would caution you not to take Q1 incremental margins and just multiply it by three. Steve Tusa : One last question. Q2 EPS, will they actually grow sequentially? Richard Tobin : Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Without question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Rich, maybe following up on margin. You've been asked before about achieving a 20% adjusted segment operating margin many times. You did just record over 19%. Obviously, a strong quarter there. And we know one quarter doesn't dictate a trend. But is 20% as a long-term target, maybe too low at this point, given how well you're operating in the businesses? Richard Tobin : Well, I didn't expect that one today, Andy. Look, I'll put it this way. We're pleased with the operational performance and we're pleased with the mix impact on the operating margin, clearly reaching 19% at the segment level in Q1 of 2021. The 20%, I guess, is earlier in reach than even we had been modeling it in the past. Now, that is going to be \u2013 I'm not going to do this big mix discussion again. I guess over the balance of the year \u2013 so number one, the answer is we're going to get to 20% earlier than we thought based on current trajectory. So, what that means \u2013 I'm not putting a target out there yet. We'll give you one maybe in Q3.  What we are going to fight against between now and the end of the year, we've discussed the mix impact of margins, is inflationary input costs between raw materials, labor, and price costs. As we discussed, at the end of 2020, we were on the front foot in terms of getting price out there. Think about it in terms of inventory change, the inflation on the raw materials was not in our inventory. So, you get positive price cost early in the transition as long as you stay on the front foot. Now, we're going to be really closely watching price cost over the balance of the year in terms of net realization. So, we would have expected to get the biggest benefit in Q1. By and large, that's where we expect it. The way it's looking, we may have to intervene on price, again, in certain of the businesses over the balance of the year. And that will impact the margin performance.  So, yeah, look, 2020 when we put the target out there was 400 basis points improvement, I think, from the time period we put it out there. Clearly, I think we'll be revisiting those longer-term targets sometime this year. Andy Kaplowitz : Just following up on he sort of the confidence level in DRFE in the sense that you've got now a couple quarters of revenue and backlog. I did notice you talked about increasing capacity at Belvac in heat exchangers. So, you've said before, Rich, that it could be a multi-year cycle in this business. Does the confidence level go up around that sort of comment in the past? Do you see potential for double-digit growth, mid-teens margins? Is the confidence level around that higher now? Richard Tobin : Well, it's getting higher with every passing month of the backlog build. So if you go back and look at the comments, refrigeration gets a lot of the color, it's the biggest piece of the segment, their backlog continued to build. That's the one that we said that we're relatively confident that we're in kind of a secular growth period for, we would say, 36 months [indiscernible] see it. I think it's been augmented now by transition to CO2 which should be somewhat of a tailwind that we didn't really recognize maybe even six months ago. So I think that's helpful. And how long the transition from expanding capacity in can making and the transition from PEP to aluminum, how long that goes, remains to be seen. As Brad mentioned I think in his comments, we're booking well into 2022 now.  On the heat exchanger side, I think that we are outgrowing the market quite frankly. I think that we've got some unique positioning, especially in heat pumps. We are expanding capacity now. So, based on new product launches and expanded capacity, I think that we can outgrow the market. But generally speaking, that's a low-single digit growing market over time. We'd like to see if we can push through and kind of outperform. Operator : Your next question comes from one of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : On the supply chain stuff, it doesn't sound like it's the stuff that's front and center in everybody's mind, i.e. semiconductors. It sounds like it might be kind of more basic sort of stuff. Could you actually elaborate a little bit on the on the types of pressures you're seeing and how widespread they are? Richard Tobin : I think we have some exposure on electronic components. It's not huge, but it does impact a few of our businesses. And that is more not chip bait. That is logistics supply chain based. So, you can go take a look at what's going on in the Port of Los Angeles right now. I'm hoping that that will unbuckle now that COVID seems to be passing. But a lot of that is just moving the materials that are sourced out of Asia. But the whole freight logistics chain is kind of \u2013 I guess it's tight right now. And it's tight. And it's reflected in the logistics costs that we've had to bear. And it's tight in terms of getting the deliveries we want.  But then, like anything else at Dover, becomes very anecdotal because we're not vertically integrated industrial, making one product. So, we've had issues with hydraulic components in ESG. We'd have issue with lighting systems in refrigeration. So, there's a laundry list of things. But for the most part, it's, let's call it, supply chain logistics constraints that are impacting us. Jeff Sprague : Pump & Process margins did look, I guess I could say, awesome. I would assume there's an unusually rich mix in the quarter. But maybe you could just provide a little bit of color on what you think kind of normalized margin rates are in that business? Richard Tobin : It is a very good mix in the quarter. We made that presentation last year about our biopharma and single use pumps business. I kind of tried to give everybody idea what that business was capable of delivering at. So, that was a business because of its capacity utilization is running \u2013 is converting at gross margin level right now, which is very healthy. We're watching it closely. Right now, it is actually a short cycle business. We're trying to build our backlog, but we really don't have a lot of visibility. So I think that we're being prudent in terms of our second half estimates, in terms of how long that goes.  On the industrial pump side, it's actually been quite robust also, but that's more channel inventory. Interestingly, we had a very good performance in China in the pump business in Q1, and it's been some time since we've seen that, and the margins were quite healthy. And you have to recall that the management had been very proactive in taking costs out in 2020. And so, we have the roll forward benefit on the industrial pump side on the margin moving into 2021. So, that was quite healthy. I think on pumps and polymers, this is a business that I think that the management team has effectively doubled the margin in the last three years. So, gross margins in that business are healthy again.  So, overall, what's going to impact the margin the most is going to be mix. Even when precision components does come back in the second half, it's not overtly dilutive to it. Slightly so. The bigger issue is going to be how does demand hold up on single use pumps in the second half of the year? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a first question around just the organic sales outlook. So, heard you loud and clear on the RFP getting better as you go through the year. I just wondered if you could revisit perhaps the organic growth outlook by segment. You gave numbers on the Q4 call for each one. Just wondered in the context of your higher organic growth guide, it looks like about two points maybe firm-wide, which were the divisions that really led that organic growth increase for the company overall? Richard Tobin : Let's start at the top. If our capital goods businesses return in the second half, as we would expect, that would meet our original forecasts, I think it's \u2013 vehicle services group looks to be poised to get a \u2013 probably a full point of organic growth that we did not expect at the beginning of the year.  The printing and ID business is performing as expected. Clearly, the upside is if textile comes back in a robust fashion in the second half. Right now, we don't have the backlog that would support that thesis. But if it turns, we'll probably have a lot more color on that one at the end of the second quarter. DFS looks like it may have a point, if not two. One of those points is based on the acquisitions that we've made. So, you get a point of growth there. When that rolls into organic or not, I have to look in the calendarization of blah, blah, blah. But just in terms of total, that's why we gave out total growth early on here and didn't try to parse it between organic and inorganic, but we may get a point of growth. We'd like to take a real close look on OPW or the undergrad portion of it and see how it develops on hanging hardware. But we'd expect that to get better over the year, offsetting what's likely to be the negative EMB headwind that we have on the above ground side in the second half. I answered Jeff Sprague's question about Pumps & Process Solutions. So I've gone through that one.  And look, our backlog in DRFE, Belvac adding to its backlog doesn't do anything with the revenue. They're going to pause, it's purely execution now, how much of that backlog they can realize. And we just expanded capacity there to help them do it. I think the outlier is going to be refrigeration. So, we've got a real robust backlog. That is a short cycle business. So, we don't have \u2013 I think we may be eating into the beginning of Q3 right now in terms of orders. So we don't have anything for Q4. I think we probably need another quarter to kind of get that tightened down. Julian Mitchell : Definitely, the operating margin, you sound very confident in that 30-percent-ish conversion range off a higher sales number. The free cash flow margin guide is similar to before, higher free cash flow, I suppose in dollars because of the revenue guide increase. The capex guide is unchanged. So, you're just kind of dialing in, maybe \u2013 look, it's a very complicated operating environment that may put some extra strain on working capital over next six months. Maybe just help us understand what impacts we see in the cash flow from these constraints on components and so forth? Not so much the P&L. Richard Tobin : Okay, a couple of things. We are giving latitude to our businesses to build working capital to compete for market share at this point, number one. And number two, I think that we mentioned, at the end of the year, we've given some latitude on working capital to prebuy their own raw materials to get in front of what we expect it to be inflationary environment.  The fact of the matter is, in Q1, the performance is based on a couple things. Number one, we did not \u2013 our payables balance exiting 2020 was not as high as it had been in previous quarters. So, there wasn't a snap back in terms of making those payables in Q1 that we've seen in the past. And quite frankly, our conversion or velocity of working capital in Q1, because the revenue was what it was, was a lot higher than we would normally see. So, look, [indiscernible] hit your nail on the head. In absolute terms, if we're guiding the revenue up and the margin looks like it's proactive, then in absolute dollars, then free cash flow should move at the same. We're working really hard on it. And I think that we probably like a quarter or two can revisit the metric as a percent of revenue. But for right now, I think we're confident that absolute dollar cash flow would be quite healthy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a follow-up question on sustainability of margin in Pumps & Process Solutions? Do you guys have a sense on dynamic between, particularly in biopharma, between the base business, diagnostics, and other COVID related stuff? Just sort of thinking, if you look at life science companies, right, some companies are more exposed to tests. So, those may turn negative next year. But then other companies say, hey, going into 2022, there's enough base year building that it's going to be sort of sustainable growth into 2022. So how should we think about that business? Richard Tobin : Well, you basically have the Q&A that we give to the person that runs that business for us, and we try to unpack that. The only recent data that we do have is that development for follow-on vaccines looks like it's quite robust, number one, and that there was a view at some point that you are going to move from skid development to much larger incubators over time and that transition is negative to single use and we don't see it right now. Now, does that change between now and the end of the year? Our view? I'm sure it will change every quarter as we work through it. And that's why we're being a bit cautious in terms of the duration of the demand that we have in that particular sector. Because if it goes to large incubation, then the volume or the demand, this is a business that's been growing in the high teens for 24 months now. When that begins to roll over, right now we don't see it. I can tell you that right now, we're expanding at capacity again in the case that it's durable. But it's hard to say right now. Andrew Obin : Just sort of thinking about refrigeration. This sort of, A, what I'm trying to get at sort of thinking about normalized margins for refrigeration. When do you think we will hit normalized volumes? And how should we think about incrementals in refrigeration? You did say it's going to be negative for the mix. But given all the restructuring, could these guys have high incrementals and corporate average for the rest of the year? So, two questions. Richard Tobin : I don't know. I'd have to go do the sums for corporate average, but our expectation that they will be a larger contributor to year-over-year profits in at minimum Q2 and Q3. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Inch of Gordon Haskett. John Inch : Rich, I'm wondering if we could just maybe provide a little bit more context around your strategic pricing, whatever you'd like to offer. So, sort of what businesses \u2013 are you raising prices? What businesses do you still have to raise prices for? And what's the channel reception? Is everybody else doing it too? And just any kind of context you could provide us? Is this also going to get worse as they go throughout the year? You think it's going to kind of hold where things are? Richard Tobin : Can I say hard to say, John? Look, we're raising prices \u2013 this all started with raw materials. So, you can go through our portfolio. Clearly, the capital goods side has got the biggest exposure to the raw materials and they were on the front foot at the beginning. And from what we can see, so far, it looks like the entire complex is following along. Now it takes 90 to 180 days to see what realization is because you get pricing out there, then you got inventory turns, and blah, blah, blah. So, that's where it started.  But the fact of the matter is, I get it that the Fed doesn't want to recognize inflation. But there is inflation. And it's not just the raw materials because raw materials are in the sub-components that we buy from our vendors who are trying to pass along the same kind of price increases that goes into our bill of materials and everything else. And clearly, at the assembly level, on labor, availability is becoming a problem. And that is beginning to start to move up labor costs over time. So, it's now gone from \u2013 it's the capital good sides that are buying a lot of raw materials. Now it's moving into the assembled components portions of the business, that is going to have to accommodate that over the balance of the year.  On top of that, as I mentioned before, logistics costs, we ship a lot of product that's FOB. It's more inbound logistics costs than it is outbound logistics costs. But freight costs are going up because \u2013 God forbid you have to air freight anything right now, it's a bit of a negative. So, we are going to be on it in terms of price costs. And it's hard for us because of the disparity of the SKUs that we have in this portfolio. It's not like we're making cars. So we're going to be on it. And it's a trailing number and we're going to have to do it as a combination of as the numbers come out and our intuition going in. But at worst, it's going to have to be a scenario of net neutral. John Inch : At worst, okay. Interestingly enough, does this provide a framework or opportunity for Dover if this tentacle of inflation or these tentacles of inflation really kind of proliferate to start to raise prices, perhaps not on so much a surgical basis? So, it's sort of implied in your answers, the channel is not really resisting. People aren't saying, excuse me, you can't raise prices in this regard, we'll go to competitor B or whatever. None of us want to see rampant inflation. But if there's mild inflation that's across the board, can Dover start to raise pricing in other areas that maybe aren't quite as affected, but still help your profitability, particularly if the channel is kind of more willing to accept because of general inflation, blah, blah, blah? Richard Tobin : Well, I guess the answer is yes. But let me give you an example. We have raised prices in refrigeration and lost volume because of it. Because we're more interested in that particular business to raising the operating margin. And as a material component of the market structure, it's up to us to lead the market and stop complaining about the fact that there's no pricing power in it. So, that's an example there.  We've got certain other businesses where our gross margins are significantly higher. And there, we may waive it off because if we've got an opportunity to grab share, now's the time to do it. So, we don't manage the portfolio and giving a \u2013 here's the three bullet points and everybody go execute it. We do it based on market structure, competitive environment, and a variety of other things. So, it's a combination of a variety of things. Whether it's price cost, positive defaults to the bottom line, or market share gains and gross margins that fall to the bottom line, we'll take it either way. Operator : Your next question coming from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : Rich, I don't think you mentioned in your prepared remarks anything about the M&A pipeline. Is there any light at the end of the tunnel with the higher valuations that you're seeing out there or availability of assets? Richard Tobin : Well, I guess the good news, Scott, is that as our margins move up, we can be more expansive in terms of what the multiple was willing to pay because if we wound the clock back a couple years ago, a lot of what we looked at was trading at a much higher multiple that we're trading at and we've gone a long way of fixing it. So, yeah, we're looking at some interesting things in the pipeline. Look at the cash flow this year, is proactive. So, as I mentioned at the end of last year that we're going to make some quicker decisions probably this year in terms of capital deployment or capital return. So, yeah, I think that \u2013 look, the management team here was challenged to deliver margin accretion over time on the base portfolio. And the trade-off was, if you do so, then we're going to reinvest in your businesses. We've done that on an organic basis in a meaningful way. I think that we've got certain portions of the portfolio that have earned the right now to be a little bit more expansive inorganically. So, we're probably more on the front foot today than we've been in my tenure here. Scott Davis : You'd mentioned, I think, at one of the conferences a couple of new automation projects that you guys are doing, I think, in vehicle and waste. But can you give us a little bit of color on those projects? And any sense of how do you cadence stuff like that into an up cycle when you're trying to manage high demand, but also you might have some downtime and such to implement projects? Richard Tobin : Yeah, you've got to be careful. I think that we've done a few of them here now. So I think that we're getting better at them in terms of how much inventory do we have to prebuild to accommodate for execution risk. I'm confident that I think that the two bigger ones that we have going on right now, we've got \u2013 just like we did in refrigeration \u2013 the floor space to accommodate kind of the CapEx portion of the project, to run on the installed base. So you've got a transitory period, but it's not as if you have to shut down to redo the plant and do it that way. It's kind of you build it on the side and you just open it up over time.  A lot of what else we're doing now is we're doing a lot of work on the machining centers. And that's productivity related that we're spending pretty heavily in right now. And that's some of our lower gross margin businesses. We're trying to kind of bring those up over time. And we've got some real interesting ones going on in some of our higher volume throughput businesses on inspection technology that is allowing us to increase capacity without expanding the physical footprint. And that's the one I referenced before on the biopharma side. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Rich, we talked a little bit about inventory levels being low and the demand environment remaining robust. So, it's clearly like not a pull forward in demand. I'm just wondering, like, when you think about raw material availability in 1Q and some of the supply chain disruption that you saw, was there a certain amount of revenues that you couldn't book in 1Q that got pushed out into 2Q? Maybe some color around that would be helpful. Richard Tobin : No, overall, as a corporation, we overdeliver. I would have expected that we could have forced through the funnel. If I told you about the meetings we were having around here in early January about our Q1 forecasts, we were yelling at everybody about moving them up. And then we've got a lot of demand. And I would have expected that we would have had \u2013 we had anecdotal issues that I referenced, but the fact of the matter is, in total, we over delivered. So, what went on in Pumps & Process Solutions as a whole, their ability to get that amount of product out in an intra-quarter period where they actually didn't even have all those orders, I think, was impressive. So, we did lose some volume in ESG. We lost some volume in refrigeration. But overall, we over deliver them what I would have expected if I looked at kind of backlog conversion expectation going into the year. Joe Ritchie : I guess maybe just kind of following on that conversation with John on price cost. It looks like you've got about 80 basis points of price this quarter. You made some comments around \u2013 not all the costs are inflationary costs that would be in your inventory. So, I'm just curious to see whether it's discussing the price cost impact in 1Q or how you see that playing out for the rest of the year. I'm just curious to hear how you're thinking this is going to \u2013 the trajectory is going to look like going forward? Richard Tobin : I think that we would have expected to be positive in Q1 just because of the timing of the action that we took on pricing, which actually started in Q4 of last year. And then it gives then between what's stuck in inventory and then what is pre-announced kind of these \u2013 the price increases effective April 1 and how does that drive backlog and whether you can reprice that backlog. I think that we're vigilant about it. But bottom line is, the only way we're really going to know is over time. So, I don't know Q2 right now, whether we're going to be price cost, whether it's going to be a credit or debit. I think it's going to be a credit, right? But between announced price increases and price realization, and all of the noise around the subcomponents because you can't measure inflation and you can do it for raw materials and castings because it's kind of bulk orders and you only have a few suppliers, but you're talking about subcomponents across this portfolio, it's quite difficult to measure. So, Brad and I were discussing it this morning. It's the one thing that we've got to really keep our eyes on. And look, we'll have more color on it by the time we close Q2. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just taking a step back on kind of the recovery as a whole here, Rich, you guys are going to be back to pre-COVID levels pretty soon and certainly before year end, it looks like. Where are you seeing evidence that this is maybe a stronger recovery versus the line that you used earlier that you had some pent up demand from 2020? Like, is this a stronger cycle? Or is this sort of catch up on stuff that really should have gotten done last year? Richard Tobin : All of the above, Josh, I guess. Look, if we go back to 2019, we've introduced a lot of new products, believe it or not, between our 2019 base and our 2021 trajectory. We've also been, I want to say, overly active in M&A, but we did some inorganic investments from 2019 through 2021. So, those end up being topline credits. Forget what the total aggregate demand environment is. Look, the recovery looks like it's broad based at the end of the day. There are trade-offs were, in 2019, certain geographies are stronger, and now they're weaker, but they have their own reasons why. I think that the only one that we can really point to where there's an inflection of the demand environment is refrigeration. But we talked about that, leading into 2021, where we went through a three to four year period where the capital base was under invested by big box retail and now we're going into a cycle. We're calling it a three year cycle. Let's hope it's four. And then you've got some interesting changes in in \u2013 structural changes like that are impacting things like Belvac where this transition to aluminum cans is kind of cyclical where you know that business hasn't grown in a very long time. And now it's making a pretty sweeping transition for COVID reasons and environmental reasons. So, the 2019 base is important, but we would have expected that if we rebased 2019 for new product launches and acquisitions, that base would have been higher anyway at the end of the day, if that answers your question. Josh Pokrzywinski : We've sort of beaten some of the backlog discussion to death, but maybe just one more for good measure. You mentioned that you were able to get a lot of product out the door in the first quarter. Wasn't really a lot of bottlenecks on your side. But a lot of the commentary about backlog seems kind of second half focused. Is there a point at which lead times sort of temper the order intake that folks say, hey, I'm not going to get this for a while, so I'm going to hold off and see what life is like? Or is it the inverse? Because it just seems like there's an awful lot of backlog pretty early in the year. Richard Tobin : It depends on the business at the end of the day and the market structure. We tend to compete in some pretty concentrated market structures where unless there's a disparity between us and an individual competitor, that's what we're competing with. I think it remains to be seen whether the distribution demand begins to \u2013 that rate of increase slows down because if it's not liquidating \u2013 it's not liquidating out of distribution inventory at the same pace that it's coming in, then, obviously, it's going to slow down. It's a bit too early to tell, quite frankly. So, the long lead time items where markets are concentrated, I don't think it's going to have a negative impact on the short cycle side. What we're trying to do on the short cycle side is forcefully build the backlog because generally speaking, the bigger backlog that we are, the more efficient we are as producers, but that is going to be tied up on the competitive environment and product availability and everything else. So we'll see. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

This call will be available on our website for playback through August 3rd, and the audio portion will be archived for three months. Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to uncertainties and risks. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and our most recent Form 10-Q for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were strong across the board and we are especially pleased with the top-line performance considering the complicated operating environment. The demand environment in the quarter was robust and continued the momentum from the first quarter and despite posting a 30% organic top-line growth, we exit Q2 with a sequentially higher order backlog. I'll focus on the bigger picture here and highlight again what we believe is underappreciated aspect of our portfolio, it's organic growth potential. Our revenue in the second quarter was above the pre-pandemic comparable quarter in 2019 and resulted in the highest revenue first half of the year in recent Dover history, meaning that the majority of our markets are not simply recovering but are operating in a growth environment. New order bookings remain robust with all segments posting book-to-bill above one; resulting in sequential comparable growth in backlog as I mentioned earlier. Operating margin conversion was solid for the quarter as a result of good execution at the operating level on healthy mix of products delivered in the quarter. All of this is well and good, but make no mistake, the operating environment remains very challenging. It's been 90 days since the last time we were asked the question about the duration of \"transitory inflation\". As we've discussed after the first quarter, we had some line of sight of raw materials cost trajectory coming into the year, which allowed us to get in front from a price cost perspective. We have also proactively given our operating companies some leeway on working capital decisions to build inventories based on the backlog trajectory. What we underestimated was the -- was the total cost impacts of a strained logistics system and tight labor market that shows no signs of abating. This has had two knock-on effects on our results. First, the absolute costs of inbound and outbound freight were materially higher, and second and more important, the costs associated with production line stoppages due to lack of labor and components caused by trends and time uncertainty and overall supply chain tightness. I'll deal with the market dynamics and supply chain impact by business later in the presentation, but based on our experience so far, I'm concerned about the notion that the current economy needs to be further stimulated and second order implications of that line of thinking and I'll leave it at that. Our teams have done a commendable job navigating these choppy waters and continue shipping products and driving robust margin conversion and strong cash flow. Overall, we believe that our operating model has been an advantage to us as we are largely a localized producer and are not overly reliant on extended supply chains. This is clearly reflected in our top-line performance in the quarter. As we look to the second half of the year, our order backlogs make us confident in our top-line trajectory. Our forecast do not incorporate much in the way of an improvement nor deterioration of the operating challenges that we've witnessed during the first half. We're just going to have to power through and work with our suppliers and customers to adapt to the prevailing conditions. We are raising our annual revenue growth guidance to 15% to 17%, and our adjusted EPS guidance to $7.30 a share to $7.40 a share. We also expect stronger cash flow as a result of the improved margin performance. Skip to Slide 4, which provides a more detailed overview of our results in the quarter. Engineered Products revenue was up 25% organically. Vehicle services which is strong across all geographies and product lines and had record bookings during the quarter. Industrial automation demand was strong across the automotive sector and in China. Aerospace and defense posted an all-time record revenue during the second quarter. Waste hauling was flat year-over-year as the business continues to wrestle with component and labor availability issues that are constraining product shipments. Importantly, waste handling bookings were robust and the backlog was up nearly 75% versus the prior year. Engineered Products is our most exposed segment to input and logistics cost inflation due to materials intensity, contractual pricing dynamics and relatively higher share of international sourcing in vehicle services. You can see it in the margin -- the segment's margin was flat year-over-year as strong volume leverage and pricing increases were offset by input cost and freight inflation, as well as labor and component availability challenges. Fueling Solutions was up 25% organically in the quarter on the strength of the above ground and below ground retail fueling globally, including some remaining tailwinds from the EMV opportunity in the U.S. following the April deadline. Vehicle wash has had -- has been strong this year and our recent ICS acquisition integration and performance is ahead of plan. Activity in China in fuel transport remains subdued, but there are signs of Chinese operators reopening their tendering activity. Order backlogs were up 29%, and we expect our software and service business hanging hardware, vehicle wash and compliance-driven underground product offerings to help offset the anticipated headwinds from the EMV roll-off. The segment posted another strong sequential margin performance on higher volumes, strategic pricing initiatives, productivity actions and mix. Sales in Imaging & ID improved 20% organically. The core marking & coding business grew well on strong printer demand across all geographies with China and India driving particularly strong performance. Serialization software also grew ahead of expectations. The digital textile printing business was up significantly against the comparable quarter when much of their operations were locked down in Northern Italy last year, but nevertheless, the business remains impacted though we are beginning to see growth in demand for large printers, particularly in Asia and continued growth in ink consumable volumes. Margins improved by 420 basis points on volume leverage, pricing and productivity initiatives. Pumps & Process Solution posted another banner quarter at 34% organic growth on improved volumes across all businesses except Precision Components. Demand for biopharma connectors and pumps are intended to be -- to be strong driven by vaccine and non-COVID related pharmaceutical tailwinds. Industrial pumps grew by over 20% on robust end customer demand with particular strength in China. Polymer processing shipments grew year-over-year and continued strength in Asia and is gaining momentum in the U.S. market. Precision Components was slightly down in the quarter though demand conditions have stabilized and are recovering well in some end markets and geography giving us confidence in the second half trajectory. Margins in the quarter expanded by 910 basis points on strong volumes, favorable mix and pricing. Top-line growth in Refrigeration & Food Equipment continued its impressive clip posting a 44% organic growth. Revenue in the beverage can making doubled in the quarter and bookings nearly doubled as well. The business is now booked into late 2022. Food retail saw broad-based growth across its product lines, door cases are now booking into 2022, and the demand for natural refrigerants is driving outside growth in our systems business in the U.S. and in Europe. Backlog in food retail is now double where it was last year. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in all geographies with rebounding order rates and commercial HVAC in North America and record order intake in EMEA extending lead times for heat pumps and boilers. Foodservice equipment was up in the quarter on a tough comp, chain -- no, actually on an easy comp, and chain restaurant demand is robust, but the institutional market is still recovering. Margins in the segment improved by 580 basis points, driven by strong volumes and productivity actions partially offset by availability issues with installation raw materials and labor and food retail operations, we expect -- which we expect to subside in the second half. And I'll pass it on to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6 of the presentation deck, on the top of the -- on the top of the page is the revenue bridge. Our top-line organic revenue increased by 30% in the quarter with all five segments posting growth with particular strength in our Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. FX benefited the top-line by about 5% or $68 million. Acquisitions added $19 million of revenue in the quarter. There were no year over impacts from dispositions. The revenue breakdown by geography reflect strong growth in North America, Europe and Asia, our three largest regions. The U.S., our largest market posted 25% organic growth in the quarter on solid trading conditions in retail fueling, marking & coding, biopharma, food retail and can making. Europe grew by 30% on strong shipments in vehicle aftermarket, biopharma and industrial pumps and heat exchangers. All of Asia was up 38% organically on growth in biopharma, marking & coding, plastics and polymers, heat exchangers and retail fueling demand outside of China. China, which represents a little over half of our business in Asia was up 33% organically in the quarter. Moving to the bottom of the page, bookings were up 61% organically, reflecting continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across all five segments. Going to the earnings bridges now on Slide 7. On the top of the chart, adjusted EBIT was up $173 million and margin improved 400 basis points, as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation. Adjusted segment EBITDA was up 350 basis points. Going to the bottom of the chart. Adjusted net earnings improved by $135 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher taxes, as well as higher corporate expenses primarily relating to compensation accruals and deal expenses. The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits was approximately 21.7% for the quarter compared to 21.6% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $11 million in the quarter or $9 million higher than 2020 for approximately $0.07 of a year-over-year EPS impact. Rightsizing and other costs were $11 million in the quarter or $8 million after-tax. Now, on Slide 8. We are pleased with the cash performance thus far this year, with free cash flow of $364 million, a $96 million increase over last year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 9% of revenue for the first half of the year, 80 basis points higher than the comparable period last year, despite a significant investment in working capital and the impact of prior year tax deferrals that did not repeat this year. Also as we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customers' strong order rates and build inventory to ensure we can meet the current demand in the second half of the year. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Okay, thanks, Brad. Let's try to pause here for a moment, because this is a complicated slide, but I think it's a transparent view of what we think is going to happen over the second half of the year and includes our current view of the outlook of the second half by segment provides context of how we are thinking about full year guidance, which I'll get to shortly. Remember, the demand environment is strong across the portfolio, so let's not try to get overexcited about headwinds or mix commentary. We managed it in H1 and we will do it again in H2, but this is the reality of the situation in terms of the dynamic of the business. We expect top-line growth -- top-line in Engineered Products to remain robust through the remainder of the year based on solid backlog and good bookings trajectory. Momentum in the vehicle aftermarket, industrial automation should continue, while we expect the improved order rates and backlogs and solid waste handling and industrial winches to drive solid year-over-year growth in the second half. Aerospace and defense is expected to be modestly down largely as a result of a difficult year-over-year comparison on -- on project deliveries. Supply chain constraints and cost inflation are expected to continue to have a material impact on the segment. Waste handling and automotive aftermarket businesses are our largest business exposed to the trifecta of raw materials inflation, extended supply chains and a larger proportion of assembly labor. Our management teams are winning in the marketplace considering the headwinds which is reflected in the growth rate and order books. But we are clearly at the point of having defend our market position at the expense of the price cost dynamic, which will be detrimental to near-term margins, but not material, slightly detrimental. And we expect Fueling Solutions to provide organic growth for the full year above our initial expectations on the back of growth in systems and software, recovering underground demand and vehicle wash. Recall that above ground business as a tough second half due to the North American EMV volumes. Margins in Fueling Solutions will be up for the full year, though we expect modest margin compression in the second half relative to the first half on slightly lower volumes and negative product and geographic mix, which I think that we covered at the end of Q1 as with less North America volume due to EMV and more international volume that's slightly dilutive. Trading conditions in Imaging & ID are expected to continue their positive trajectory for the remainder of the year. Our core marking & coding business is expected to maintain its growth trajectory with services and serialization products positively impacting performance. Digital textile printing is recovering, and we expect the end of the year, we will well above 2020, but below its 2019 high watermark. We expect operating margins to remain stable in the second half. Pumps & Process Solutions should see a solid second half. Demand for biopharma and hygienic applications remain robust with customers now placing orders into 2022. We are strategically investing an additional clean room capacity for this platform to support its growth. Trading conditions in industrial pumps are strong and driven by robust and customer demand as opposed to channel stocking. Plastics and polymers is expected to be steady though this business faces a difficult comparable period due to a strong performance last year. Precision Components will return to growth in the second half as OEM new-builds will supplant increased activities at refineries and petrochemical plants. We expect margins to remain strong in the segment, but we may see some minor dilution due to mix on the back half as our Precision Components business recovers, but the absolute profit trajectory of this segment is in very good shape. With its large backlog and high sustained order rates, Refrigeration & Food Equipment will finish the year strong, with double-digit growth expected for all operating businesses. New orders in core food retail business have been healthy across the product segments and the tailwinds from our leadership position and natural refrigerants are driving outside growth for our systems business. We expect to begin to significantly ramp up shipments of our new digital door product. Belvac continues to work through its record backlogs. They are now taking orders for late 2022 and even into 2023. Heat exchanger business is positioned well as they are seeing strong order rates across all verticals and geographies. We have been investing in capacity and new capabilities in these two businesses and are well positioned to capture the growth. Foodservice equipment demand is normalized and returned to growth at restaurant chains and institutional business continues to improve. We expect this business to post solid growth in the second half albeit against a low comparable. We expect margins to continue their seasonally adjusted upward trajectory for the remainder of the year. Improved volume leverage, productivity gains and positive product mix and business mix should more than offset operational challenges related to component and labor shortages, increased logistics costs and input cost inflation. Moving to Slide 10. We remain on the front foot investing behind our business to support the growth, productivity and long-term portfolio enhancement. Organic high return on investment projects remain our top priority for capital allocation. On the left hand, you can see a sample of the current growth and productivity CapEx projects that we are working on, that add up to $75 million of spend. The project mix is balanced between growth and productivity with a skew towards new capacity and supporting long-term growth in key priority portions of our portfolio. Our next priority in capital allocation is strategic bolt-on acquisitions and enhance the long-term growth profile and attractiveness of our portfolio. You can see that with that all four of our recent acquisitions were in either digital or high growth single use pumps markets. These are small additions, but we are very excited about scaling up these highly innovative technologies as part of our G&A portfolio. We remain on the hunt for acquisitions, have a solid M&A pipeline as we enter the second half. Our current dry powder on a full year '21 basis is approximately $3.3 billion. Our revised annual guidance is on Page 11. We are increasing our top-line forecast to reflect the durability and demand trends that we are seeing. We now expect to achieve 15% to 17% all-in revenue growth this year. Our $0.55 adjusted EPS guidance increase is mindful of the supply chain, and input challenges we summarized earlier in the presentation and we expect free cash flow generation to edge higher as well due to margin improvements. On the bottom of the page, we show our expected '21 performance in a multi-year perspective. We remain on track to deliver strong returns through a combination of robust organic revenue growth, strong margin expansion and disciplined capital allocation. Before wrapping up, I want to thank everybody at Dover for their perseverance and accomplishments executing in today's challenging environment. And with that, Andrey, we'll open it up to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys, Rich, nice quarter. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Rich, can you give more color into what you're seeing in terms of margin progression in Pumps & Process and Refrigeration. I know you just talked about it, but if you look at Pumps & Process, you've been sustaining that 30% level, can you keep doing that, and I know you talked about a little dilution there? And then on the refrigeration side, like how would you assess the sort of march toward that mid-teens margin goal that you've talked about? Richard Tobin : On the Pumps & Process Solutions side of the portfolio, nothing deteriorates in the second half, it's just pure mix. So what I'm -- what I was trying to make clear is one of the businesses that suffered greatly last year and is beginning to improve now is our Precision Components business that is slightly dilutive to margins, but in terms of absolute profit, it's a positive, so I wouldn't get overly chuffed about that. On the refrigeration side, we expect third quarter margins to be the highest of the year just based on seasonality and the size of our backlog and everything else. Quite frankly, we're a bit disappointed in the margin in Q2, but I don't think that's the fault of management, but we've had a really difficult time with freight costs and components and labor availability. So on one hand, I think the effort on their part to get the product out the door was excellent. The bottom line is we disappointed a bunch of customers in our ability to get the product out because of the supply chain issue. So the trajectory is good and as you can see from the backlogs, this is more of a 2022 story now more than a 2021 story. Andy Kaplowitz : That's helpful. And then we know you want to be conservative given all the crosscurrents out there, but you're obviously forecasting revenue to come off a bit from Q2 with a backlog up 70%, you talked about EMV coming down, supply chain, the virus is still out there, but you didn't mention in your release that you have visibility already into '22. So maybe you can just talk about that visibility, and obviously it's in refrigeration, but is it across all the businesses, so that organic growth could actually be quite strong as you go into '22? Richard Tobin : Well, look, I mean, I'm not going to complain about the size of our backlog, and if you'd run the calc and -- if you'd run the calcs on that we couldn't get it out the door over the balance of the year if we wanted to. So it's up to execution, number one. And with the exception of Belvac and Maag, most of our business is short cycle. So we'll see at the end of Q2 [ph]. I mean, look at the end of the day and it's the same discussion we had at the end of Q1. The demand is there, it's up to us to get it out the door. I think that when all is said and done, I think that we probably are going to do better on average because of our -- because I think that we're advantaged from a supply chain point of view versus some of our competitors, and that's what's going to be winning in the marketplace. It's not so much a pricing dynamic right now, it's whether you can get the product out the door. So we -- I think that right now I don't in my tenure here, we've never had backlogs like this and it's a good problem to have. Andy Kaplowitz : Thank you, Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning, guys. Brad Cerepak : Hi. Richard Tobin : Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : Just kind of digging into Andy's question a little bit of a different way. I think normally you guys convert your first half orders relatively close as a percentage into sales from first half to second half. Obviously, that suggests like a kind of a stupidly high revenue number for the year relative to your guidance like $700 million higher. Obviously, there is supply constraints and things may be getting pushed into '22. Can you maybe just talk about like the mechanics of this backlog, what's converting, what's different when it comes to the conversion from orders into sales this cycle, if you will? I mean I'm sure it's much more extended obviously, this cycle or maybe like just mechanically, is there double ordering going on, is there our guys pushing deliveries into '22, just a little more of the mechanics around that? Richard Tobin : Sure. I think that we discussed it a little bit at the end of Q1. Clearly, based on our backlogs of exit in Q1 and then Q2 because of the demand function was going to be higher than kind of what a normal seasonality would be just because of where the demand was. So it's just purely a function of where you could get it out the door or not at the end of the day. So that's the good news. So I don't think you can look at Q2 and just say, well, I'm going to go back and look at history and then Q3 is this much higher than Q2 and then that it's going to spit out a number as you said, that's just not realistic quite frankly. So as point number one, so I'd be careful about calculating seasonality based on history just because of the strength of the first half just because of the recovery coming out of the pandemic. In terms of the backlog, yes, we'd have to break it down because we've got some long cycle backlog, I mean we mentioned Belvac, which is booking into 2023 now is a piece of that, that we'll just convert over time. We don't believe that there's double ordering going on right now. From what we can tell, it looks like it's just a recognition by the customer base of the constraints that are out in the system that in previous periods you just didn't have to put the orders in, you want to get in line. So that is what is expanding the backlog. I mean, I think you asked the question at the end of Q1 about this whole issue of channel stocking, destocking, and we took a close look, I mean, we grew our industrial pumps business by 20% in the quarter. So we took a or over that actually, but so we took a close look at channel checks and we don't see that inventory building up at our distributors, it's just passing right through. So that's good news at the end of the day, because it means it's fundamental demand. So I think it's two issues. We've got some long cycle businesses that are booking out well further than historically they used to and then I think on our short cycle businesses, I think there is a recognition of the constraints in the supply chain that's just making everybody get in line further out than they normally would have. Steve Tusa : And I guess on that front on the working capital side, is there any unwind of this big inventory and receivables, I guess not receivables because your sales are going to continue to grow, but on the inventory side, I mean, any flush you see in the second half, I know you raised your free cash flow guidance, but if there is anything to nitpick at this quarter would be the working capital build was kind of sizable, any unwind there in the second half? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, I think the working capital build has been to our advantage and we'll see after everybody reports in terms of top-line, I mean, having the product available or having the components available that convert has been an advantage to us. I don't see anything fundamentally deteriorating in our working capital. We will see in the second half. I would expect to see some -- to see liquidation in Q4. And if we don't on the industrial working capital side, that means that the demand outlook for '22 is robust and what we may carry it again, but I don't think that just means higher earnings and the out -- and the outside period. So right now sitting here, we would expect free cash flow to be up, no real deterioration in terms of the metrics of working capital. We'll leave it at that to see how order rates progress over the balance of the year. Steve Tusa : Great, thanks a lot. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks, good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Rich, maybe just touch a little bit more on M&A, right, I mean you've been doing some bolt-ons, but as you know, we've got a kind of multi-billion dollar capacity here, activity seems to be picking up in your neighborhood, right. I wonder if a, you see things kind of trading away from you that you are interested in or just kind of the action ability of what you might have in your pipeline? Richard Tobin : Yes, without getting into the specifics, I think that we lost out on one deal that we chased pretty hard due to valuation, some of the other ones that you've seen transact, we're well aware of those assets and we're not participating in them. Bottom line is, it's a good news, bad news story. I mean, the bad news is, is valuations are what they are and I'll leave it at that. The good news is because valuations are what they are, then there is a lot building up that wants to come to market, because I think this is a recognition of, these are the salad days for multiples of not even earnings anymore, but of whatever you want to choose to be the multiple. So we're looking at a lot of stuff right now and we're going to remain disciplined. I mean, I think the things that we've got there are small, but we think that the network effect on the leverage of those small products is, our expectation, the returns are going to be very high in the deals that we did and we'll see in the second half. Jeff Sprague : And a unrelated different question, just back to kind of price and how you're managing all this, what are you doing differently, I'm sure you can use the demand pulse to just extract price that people want the product bad enough, but are you able to on a drive deposits do other things to just kind of improve the commercial terms of how you're transacting with folks? Richard Tobin : It depends, I think because demand is high and capacity is tight. You can manage profitability by customer probably a little bit more efficiently than in the past, but I think in certain of our businesses and I'll go back to what I talked about at Engineered Products, when you get to the third price increase, do you actually go for the fourth price increase because the fact of the matter is, you run the risk of demand destruction in the short-term, and that's not good. So part of my comment about Engineered Products, especially around ESG and VSG is at a certain point if we go negative in terms of price cost, but the volume remains robust and the installed base goes up, that's a better trade because we believe that some of these supply chain constraints and raw materials will roll off hopefully sooner than later. And you know what, do you really go back to your core customers and say sorry, but here comes another price increase. So I think that we're managing differently across the portfolio, but we don't want to force short-term demand destruction by trying to just be draconian. Jeff Sprague : Great, makes sense, active management. Appreciate it, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hi, yes, good morning. Richard Tobin : Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hi, how are you? Just a question just to sort of to continue sort of to talk about capital allocation. You did sort of highlight over $3 billion in dry powder. How should we think, you sort of clearly have established yourself as one of the most consistent operators post COVID. So how do you think about sort of the pace that you would like, right, get assume that valuation stay where they are, but how do you see the pace of capital allocation per year in a normalized environment assuming that prices stay where they are? Richard Tobin : I don't know how to answer that. I -- look well, I'll put it in this way, Andrew, where we realistically looking at right now is about two-thirds of our dry powder. Now do we execute on that or not, I'm not sure, but I just in terms of the amount of targets and a realistic view of what the value of those targets are is about two-thirds of our dry powder. So it's quite a bit at the end of the day. But it's a realistic view and there are some deals that we just can't get there. I mean, this notion that return on invested capital made a quantum leap from three years to five years over the last 12 months, I find an interesting dynamic. And I'm not here to criticize anybody's deals, everybody has got their own strategy to a certain extent. So my -- like I said before to Jeff's question, the bad news is valuation, the good news is there's a lot of assets that see valuations of transactions in the marketplace. So the amount of opportunities that are out there and ones that are rumored to come is actually proactive to capital deployment. Andrew Obin : That's a great answer. Thank you. And then the other question maybe I missed it, but did you comment on what the price increase was in the second quarter and what are you modeling for second half of the year? Richard Tobin : The price to raw materials improves in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. The outlier is logistics costs and line stoppages, which is really the negative headwind, but priced cost on a raw material side, it's actually better in the second half than the first half. Andrew Obin : But what was the price component of organic growth in second quarter? Brad Cerepak : [Indiscernible] around that number, not that significant. Andrew Obin : And then... Brad Cerepak : It really comes down to, Andrew, it comes down to the timing of when those price increases. Rich is saying there is multiple times that price is being put in. So it's not one big bang at January 1, it kind of spreads across the year. So you get that effect. Andrew Obin : Now, now I got it. Looking at your price reaction today, I don't think anybody is complaining about your execution. Thanks so much. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Hi, Scott. Brad Cerepak : Hi, Scott. Scott Davis : Is there any way to kind of convert, Rich, you made the comment of disappointing customers, I mean, do you -- can you convert that to kind of an on-time delivery number to us and kind of what's normal and what you're at now and or any way to kind of think about it other than subjectively? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, there's really two dynamics. I think that our lead times are disappointing to our customers, because you go for years where you can convert orders within with intra-month in some of our businesses where that's just not possible. And that -- and that's where you get this function of now everybody seen it for six months and so it's got a knock-on effect of backlogs because there is a recognition of this is -- this -- this is more durable than maybe everybody thought. So the positive is it builds your backlogs at the end of the day, the negative is our lead times have stretched out. Now, you couple that with in certain of our businesses where we've had some pretty difficult logistics constraints and in some cases labor availability and then you've got disappointment of we say we're going to deliver the product on X date and we miss it and that's happened. So we can quant -- we quantify it more in dollars and cents. I'd have to go look up in terms of on-time delivery. I think across the board, it's probably okay, but there is, as I mentioned before, a business like VSG that's got probably our longest extended supply chain is suffering the most as opposed to Printing and ID that just doesn't have to deal with the reality of that. Scott Davis : Okay, now that's fair point. So just to follow-up, I mean, all the questions on M&A I think are appropriate just given where your leverage ratio is. But you could flip it over and just say well valuations are crazy, why not sell some assets here because you do have a fairly broad portfolio and some things seemed a bit better than others and is there any appetite to doing so? Richard Tobin : No, I think that -- I think that's a fair comment. I guess that's all I can say about that, but you're right, right, valuations inbound and outbound are what they are and you can manage that both ways. Scott Davis : Yes. Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just wanted to circle back maybe to Slide 9. So just to try and understand essentially is the point here that sort of this is largely relating to a half on half margin outlook and so sort of company-wide second half segment margins may be down slightly versus the first half, and then within that you've sort of got DEP and DFS may be down a bit DRFE flattish, and then DII and DPPS flat to up half on half. Is that the right sort of summary of that slide, just to make sure it's sort of half on half we're looking at? Richard Tobin : Yes, I think that if you overlay the, my comments on to the slide, they're going to match, right. I think that we're just giving you an honest assessment based on the prevailing market conditions of where we have headwinds operationally, price cost and then some commentary on mix, which is a commentary H1 to H2. So as I mentioned in my comments, I don't think we have to be overly dramatic about it. We've managed it quite well in -- in the first half and I don't expect us to manage it differently in the second half, but we have to recognize that there are certain decisions that we're making, like if you look at DEP in terms of price cost which whether from an absolute profit point of view may be in good shape with slightly dilutive margins because we're just making a choice to chase the -- to chase the volume, which I think is appropriate in that case. Julian Mitchell : That's very clear. And then, secondly looking at the cash flow, you've addressed the working capital point once or twice. Capital spending is up a decent amount this year, I think the sort of low double-digit type increase year-on-year. Just trying to think about sort of the outlook from here, how much does that reflect the sort of catch-up spend, you laid out some projects in the deck after a weaker CapEx number last year for obvious reasons, and how much is this sort of a sustainably higher level, just trying to understand how your capital intensity looks on the CapEx front beyond 2021, should we see CapEx normalize lower again or will be flat when we look at next year? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, I think that '20 we can just throw out, right. I mean, at the end of the day everybody reacted to the change in market conditions appropriately. So, like as a percent of revenue and we'll see where we end up and I don't want to do the calculations here, but as a percent of revenue, '19 to '21 is probably flattish and I would expect that to be the same going into '22. I mean, we -- one of these days we're going to do a presentation on our returns for organic investment and they absolutely blow away anything that we do inorganically. So to the extent that we find the projects going into '22, we'll spend it internally, but right now sitting here today, do I expect as a percent of our revenue to go up dramatically in '22, no. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Because I think -- yes, there is a lot of sort of broader chats about CapEx super cycles and this and that, which I think is a bit odd. It doesn't sound like from Dover's sort of internal outlook that there is anything game changing in terms of CapEx intensity as we look out? Richard Tobin : Well, you know, I think that there is an interesting argument and I would agree with it that to the extent that labor inflation is durable and that supply chains, the issues that we're having supply chains will improve, but not dramatically. There is an argument to be made that the returns on automation are going to be better than they've been over the last five years to six years, and I would agree with that. Julian Mitchell : Interesting. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Joe. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So, I'm going to -- I'm going to ask Julian's question maybe a little bit more explicitly on the margins for the second half of the year. And so it sounds like, Rich, you guys have done a great job managing those historically. When I look at Slide 9, it basically what I'm hearing from you is that incremental margins are probably going to be pretty comparable to the kind of 30% range that you just put up in the second quarter, maybe there is some slight pressure, but that's kind of how you're thinking about those in the second half, is that fair? Richard Tobin : Yes, I think that we're just trying to be transparent, Joe, right. It's very -- we could have put up the second quarter results and said everything is great and see at next quarter and then gotten away with it, but I think that we have to recognize that there are some issues that need to be overcome. To us, I don't think that we should get overly excited about it. It's just the facts are the facts we've dealt with them in H1, if anything, it becomes more of a mix issue in Q2 and that's not problematic. So as I mentioned before, DRFE is going to have its best quarter of the year from a revenue and an operating margin point of view. So that's great in terms of absolute profit, but it is dilutive to overall Group margins. So am I going to tell them to slow down to protect the margin, no at the end of the day. And that's the case -- and there's a couple of other, a couple of our businesses. I mean, if Precision Components on the back half revenue increases, but it's slightly dilutive to a, let's call it a very robust margin that we're clocking at Pumps and Process Solutions, again, I don't think it's overly problematic, but we're just trying to guide everybody of a look at the margin in Q2, but from a seasonality point of view, if I go back and look in history, Q3 is X percent higher than Q2. So let me just model that and run down the field. I think that would -- would give you a number that we would like to get to, but I'm not entirely sure just because of the pull-forward in terms of the demand and the operating leverage that we're getting in Q2. Brad Cerepak : Right. We got to be a little bit careful with the conversion to the back half as well because price materials does impact conversion. So just keep that in mind is that, that has nothing to do with absolute profits per se as Rich has talked about, but the conversion rate is influenced by that. Joe Ritchie : Sure. Now that makes sense and fully appreciate all the color you guys are providing. I guess my one follow-up and maybe just kind of focus on the near-term for a second. When you think about third quarter from a pure revenue and EPS perspective, would you expect it to be up versus the second quarter or similar? I'm just curious like how you guys are thinking about it with the way that the backlog is kind of converting into your business? Richard Tobin : Similar, I guess is the answer. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird. Mig Dobre : Yes, thank you for taking the question. I also want to ask a question about Slide 9. You've got... Brad Cerepak : That's cool. Mig Dobre : Yes. Richard Tobin : Next quarter, I'm going to look at slides. All right, go ahead. Brad Cerepak : You're going to kill that slide, but let's go ahead. Mig Dobre : You've got a -- you've got positive commentary on price cost for DII and DPPS, and just kind of looking through your disclosures in the queue, these were the segments with frankly the smallest pricing gains in the quarter, both of them a little over 1%. So I find that to be a little bit counter-intuitive right, you've got less of a pricing tailwind in these two yes you -- yet you expect better price cost dynamic. Can you may be put a finer point on this as to what's happening with these two? Richard Tobin : Well, I think Brad addressed it in an earlier question. Everybody -- we don't do our pricing on January 1st, right. It's done differently. There's signaling effect to manage backlogs. So you basically in certain businesses will say, we're going to do a price increase at the end of Q1, meaning so you lose that clocking period in Q1. So it actually ramps over the balance of the year on the comp. So again it is just a reflection of the timing of those price increases and the age kind of the H1, H2 effect of that. Mig Dobre : Okay, got it. Sorry, I missed that. Then I guess my follow up just sort of looking at your order intake, right, in Refrigeration & Food Equipment, Pumps & Process Solutions, in both these segments, you're running well ahead of what we saw pre-COVID. And I guess my question is, if we're not talking about some kind of a CapEx super cycle here, what is really happening with these end markets, and is it fair for us to think that this is sustainable to some degree into 2022 or is there a hangover to be expected here as things normalize? Thank you. Richard Tobin : We see -- I think I've tried to answer this about 15 different ways. I think that, that backlogs are building which is a reflection of constraints in the system. So I think when we get to next year, it's going to be an interesting dynamic because as those constraints come down, then lead times are going to come down, which is going to be negative to backlogs to a certain extent. But that I think that Steve asked the question or maybe wrote it earlier today, I think we're going to get -- we got to be careful with absolute backlogs and doing math on it and trying to extrapolate revenues into the future. I mean, the bottom line is that backlogs build and shrink based on lead times and market conditions and everything else. So could I envision a scenario where backlogs come down, yes. Do I think that's overly problematic, no, because to a certain extent, that means the headwinds that we have on supply chain logistics are getting better, which is better for margins at the end of the day. Mig Dobre : Yes. So Rich, to clarify I wasn't talking about backlog because I totally agree with what you're saying. I was wondering more about your bookings, right, which have been very, very strong year-to-date even relative to pre-COVID? Richard Tobin : Yes, well, look, I mean I think that we are executing really, really well in Pumps & Process Solutions. I mean we made a presentation on that on what we thought was coming at the end of '20. And look and as I mentioned at the end of Q1, we think that we are in at minimum a three-year cycle of the demand function on DRFE which is positive. And it's not just -- it's across the board, it's not just door cases, it's systems business, it's SWEP on the heat exchangers and it's Belvac, all of which we believe are in a multi-year cycle. Mig Dobre : Great, thanks for the color. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Deane Dray : Hey, I know we covered a lot of ground here. It came up multiple times about component and labor shortages. So Rich, if you could just take us through like where is it most acute today on the component side, is it semiconductors, printed circuit boards, are you qualifying new suppliers. So that's the component side, and then on the labor side, any color there, unfilled positions are you expecting a significant step-up in labor costs as this needs to adjust. So take us through that if you could? Richard Tobin : Hope boy, well, we've got a pretty wide portfolio, I'll make some general comments about the components. They're all tied. They are more problematic if they're large and imported, because if you take a look at what's going on when the logistics supply chain in the Port of Los Angeles and all that, it is a bloody mess right now, which only impacts a small portion of our portfolio, because as I mentioned in my comments at the end of the day, we think that we are winning in the marketplace because we don't have a lot of instances of that. If you've got very long supply chains and it's containerized freight coming out of Asia back to North America to fulfill demand, you are suffering quite frankly. On the labor side, it's purely in our operations that I have a higher propensity of assembly labor, and for all the reasons that we can understand that's been difficult. I think it's not getting worse as we move through the second quarter, which is a good news. So, hopefully in September, when some of these government influence in terms of the labor market begins to roll off that it will get better and everybody is going to go back to school in September. So our view right now is it's probably going to remain difficult through August, and I think that we're hopeful in September that the situation is fine. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. And then last one for me, just you talked about this last quarter and how did it play out where you said you were going to give the business units more autonomy in managing their own working capital that you gave them the green light, go ahead and build inventory, and I know there were some surprise there because you hadn't done that before, but how has that worked out, is that going to be a permanent, was that a one-time event just you needed to get in front of this demand, but just some color there would be helpful? Thanks. Richard Tobin : I mean, if the demand holds up then we'll continue to kind of given that latitude because the absolute profit versus the carrying cost of the working capital, the math works, I guess the best way I can say it. I would expect if we get improvement in the logistics supply chain that it will come down naturally, because that's what's really driving it at the end of the day. We're basically given the green light to everybody of, you've got the backlog, don't be reticent of trying to get the sub components in because we want to convert. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period, and Dover's second quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrey Galiuk, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrey Galiuk. Please go ahead, sir. Andrey Galiuk : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. This call will be available on our website for playback through October 26th and the audio portion will be archived for three months. Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to uncertainties and risks. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and our most recent Form 10-Q for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Andrey. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s go to page three. Dover Corporation and its operating companies had a solid quarter. The performance stats indicate that our product strategies, coupled with our ongoing productivity initiatives continued to deliver topline growth, margin accretion, and attractive cash flow to our investors. Our revenue and bookings growth continued to outpace our pre-pandemic levels and we exited the quarter with a record high and sequentially increased backlog while posting topline growth of 15% over the comparable period. Demand strength was broad-based as each segment posted year-over-year growth in bookings and a book-to-bill above 1. Revenue growth, product -- positive product mix, and ongoing productivity initiatives drove comparable operating margins up, resulting in a 31% increase in U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share. Our free cash flow performance was strong with an 18% year-over-year increase, despite significant investments we\u2019ve made in inventory as we begin to reap the benefits of our investments in the centralization of financial processing activities. We continue to enhance and improve our portfolio with several acquisitions completed in the last three months and the divestiture of our commercial foodservice business announced last week. Our organic investments and capacity expansions and productivity projects are on track, providing us the building blocks for the future topline growth and margin expansion. As one of the first multi-industrials to report each quarter and because of our wide end market exposures, we have the pleasure to be the operating environment bellwether, so let\u2019s get on the front foot here by providing some color on inflationary inputs, labor, and supply chain challenges, so that we have time to discuss the constructive demand environment for 2022 in the Q&A. Let me start by saying that we\u2019re particularly concerned that there have been no discernible policy changes, particularly in the U.S. to deal with these headwinds, and in fact many proposed policies run the risk of extending their duration. We take no satisfaction in the fact that we\u2019ve been telegraphing these issues all year and incorporating to the -- incorporating them into our forecast of the businesses that bear the brunt of these challenges, which I will expand upon during the segment review. We have taken the appropriate actions to offset these headwinds moving into 2022 and we are comforted by the fact that we have been given the opportunity to demonstrate the resilience of our business model and the strength of the breadth of our product and geographic market exposures that are ultimately reflected in these quarterly results. To be clear, we are very constructive about 2022 demand for our products and services and remain optimistic that there will be a recognition that protecting the duration of the current strong economic demand environment needs proactive policy decisions. We are raising our full year EPS guidance as a result of our strong year-to-date performance. Our updated forecast do not incorporate any material improvement nor deterioration of the challenging operating environment in the fourth quarter. Our priorities remain the same supporting our customers with products and services for the long-term, and the health and welfare of our employees. I will skip to slide four, which provides a more detailed review of our results for the third quarter. So let\u2019s move to slide five. Engineered Products revenue was up 14% organically with a significant portion of the growth from pricing actions. Vehicle Services posted a strong topline quarter and market indicators remained positive, with vehicle miles driven recovering and average vehicle age continuing to increase. Industrial Automation demand was up double digits with strong activity in Americas and China. Environmental Services Group revenue was up year-over-year and its backlog remained strong moving into 2022. Aerospace and Defense posted a decline year-over-year, largely a result to changes in programmed shipment timing. The margin performance in the quarter was unfortunately what we expected to occur as we progressed through the year. Our Engineered Products segment, as we\u2019ve discussed previously, has the largest exposure to raw materials, assembly labor as a percentage of cost of goods, and supply chain complexity. As such, it is more than just a price cost issue where even an equilibrium drives negative margin performance. It is exasperated by numerous component supply issues that necessitated us to intermittently curtail production to stabilize the manufacturing system in the quarter. Our management team is doing exactly what we would expect of them to protect profitability in the short-term, while managing the relationships with our strategically important customers. I have absolute confidence that the profit margin in the segment will bounce back as we move into 2022 as a result of actions already taken in price and as raw materials and supply chain constraints moderate as can be seen in the raw materials futures and stabilizing container shipping rates. Fueling Solutions was up 3% organically in the quarter on solid demand in North America for above-ground and below-ground retail fueling. We believe our production schedule and delivery times are driving share gains particularly in the above-ground category. Vehicle wash posted another strong quarter with some encouraging customer conversion and cross-selling benefits from our recent ICS acquisition. Activity in China remains subdued, driven by the lasting impacts of COVID and near-term uncertainty related to energy supply. Fuel Transport Components were negative for the quarter, but we believe that this is [expected to] (ph) improve moving forward. Margins in the segment declined 150 basis points in the quarter, as productivity headwinds from supply chain constraints and subcomponents and negative mix more than offset higher volumes and pricing. We have taken the appropriate actions on pricing to counter these headwinds going forward. Sales in Imaging & Identification grew 7% organically. The core Marking and coding business grew well on good demand for printers and consumables. Serialization Software also grew ahead of expectations and we are working to add additional resources here as we integrate the recently acquired Blue Bite brand management software into our solutions. The Digital Textile Printing business was up significantly year-over-year against a low bar comparable quarter and is continuing its gradual recovery. Margins in Imaging & ID improved by 250 basis points as volume leverage, pricing, and productivity initiatives more than offset input cost inflation. Pumps & Process Solutions posted another solid quarter at 25% organic growth. Demand for biopharma connectors and pumps continued to be strong. We continued to expand clean room capacity for our biopharma connectors and single-use pumps in the period, and we are encouraged by specification wins in Em-tec Biopharma flow meters, which we acquired last year. Industrial Pumps were up based on broad-based end customer demand with particular strength in China. Precision Components was up year-over-year as compression OEM and aftermarket businesses continued their recovery. Polymer Processing was down in the quarter due to a combination of shipment timing and a very strong third quarter from the prior year, though new order rates remained strong and outlook is positive moving into 2022. Margins in the quarter expanded by a robust 630 basis points on strong volume, fixed cost absorption, favorable product mix, and pricing. Topline results in Refrigeration & Food Equipment remained strong, posting 16% organic growth. Revenue in beverage can-making equipment doubled in the quarter. The business is booked into late 2022 and is taking orders for 2023. The heat exchanger business grew on robust demand in all geographies, led by residential heating and industrial end markets and a recovery in the global commercial HVAC demand. Order intakes continue to exceed our ability to ship, so we are adding additional capacity in two geographies to ensure that we can meet forecasted demand in 2022. Demand in Food Retail remains robust with elevated bookings and backlogs across all our product lines. However, much like our Engineered Products business, we have a difficult time with labor constraints, and in particular, subcomponent supply, which has necessitated significant operational cost in logistics, intermediate production curtailments, and in one case, deferment of a delivery into 2022. Again, management is straddling cost recovery actions and meeting demands of our customers, but it clearly comes with a cost. Margins were largely flat in the quarter as excellent operating performance and swept and Belvac offset refrigeration headwinds despite their smaller revenue base. I will pass it to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s go to slide six. On the top is the revenue bridge. Our topline organic revenue increased by 13% in the quarter, with all five segments posting growth, with strong demand in our Engineered Products, Pumps & Process Solutions and Refrigeration & Food Equipment segments. FX benefited the topline by about 1% or $21 million. Acquisitions added $18 million of revenue in the quarter. There was no year-over-year impact from dispositions. The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North America and Europe, our two largest regions and modest growth across Asia and the rest of the world. The U.S., our largest market, posted 16% organic growth in the quarter on solid trading conditions and retail, industrial automation, biopharma and can making. Europe grew by 16% in the quarter on strong shipments in marking, coding, biopharma and industrial pumps, can making and heat exchangers. All of Asia was up 5% organically on growth of biopharma and industrial pumps and heat exchangers, partially offset by year-over-year declines in polymer processing, below-ground retail fueling and fuel transport. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia was up 8% organically in the quarter. Moving to the bottom of the page. Bookings were up 25% organically, reflecting the continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across all five segments. Let\u2019s go to the earnings bridges on slide seven. On the top of the chart, the adjusted segment EBIT was up $64 million and adjusted EBIT margin improved 80 basis points, as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset cost inflation and production stoppages. Going to the bottom chart, adjusted net earnings improved by $57 million, as higher segment EBIT and lower corporate expenses more than offset higher taxes. Deal expense in the quarter were $3 million. The effective tax rate for the third quarter excluding tax discrete benefits was approximately 21.8%, compared to 21.5% in the prior year. And our effective tax rate estimate pre-discreet for Q4 and the full year remains unchanged at 21% to 22%. Discrete tax benefits were $8 million for the quarter or $4 million higher than in 2020 or approximately $0.03 of year-over-year EPS impact. Rightsizing and other costs were a $2 million reduction to adjusted earnings in the quarter, as a one-time recovery related to a cancellation settlement more than offset our ongoing productivity and rightsizing initiatives. Now on slide eight. We\u2019re pleased with the cash performance thus far this year, with cash -- with free cash flow of $667 million, a $104 million increase over last year, free cash flow conversion stands at 11% of revenue year-to-date, despite a nearly $250 million investment in working capital. As we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customers strong order rates and we are carrying high inventory levels to ensure we can meet current demand for the rest of the year and into next year. Let me turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Brad. I am on slide nine, which is a familiar format we used during the Investor Day in 2019 to describe our inorganic growth priorities. I am pleased to report that our activity since then has aligned well with those priorities and we remain busy adding logical logistic bolt-ons that will support the long-term growth of our core businesses. As you can see that we are investing in the highest priority platforms with an emphasis on high growth, high gross margin products and solutions. We remain disciplined in our approach to acquisitions and despite the challenging asset prices in today\u2019s environment, we have acquired seven bolt-on acquisitions year-to-date that meet our investment return criteria, including two in the third quarter and one that closed last week. The most recent deals highlighted in green were CDS, an industrial 3D visualization software, which we expect to grow in third-party revenues and also adopt across the Dover portfolio in our journey towards digitizing the front-end of our businesses, lowering our transaction costs. SP, which complements our Aerospace and Defense business, a software-driven signal intelligence solutions and LIQAL, which is an emerging leader in LNG and hydrogen dispensing solutions. Each transaction is modest addition to our aggregate portfolio, but we are very excited about scaling up these innovative and strategic technologies over time, and the positive impact to EPS as these investments mature. We remain on the hunt for acquisitions and have a solid M&A pipeline that aligns well with our portfolio priorities. We also took advantage of recent market activity in the Food Equipment sector to sell Unified Brands, a professional cooking equipment business for commercial foodservice operators. The deal was announced in early October and is expected to close in the fourth quarter. Unified Brands represents less than 2% of our overall revenue and its sale will have a negligible impact on our 2021 adjusted EPS. I would like to thank the management and employees of Unified Brands for the many years of service in the Dover family. As we look to the end of the year, demand outlook remains favorable across the majority of the portfolio, backlogs and bookings remain robust and we expect to post strong organic growth in Q4. Overall, we remain on track to deliver strong returns this year through a combination of robust growth in revenue, operating profit and cash flow, coupled with disciplined capital allocation. We also look forward to closing out this year and laying the foundation for what we believe to be a positive demand environment in 2022. We have clarity about the nature of the inflationary input and supply disruption costs that we incurred in Q3 and expect to queue in Q4 due to the challenging operating environment and we have conviction that we can turn them into profitability tailwinds as conditions improve and the calendar progresses from here. Before wrapping up, I would like to thank Dover for all their preservers and accomplishments executing in today\u2019s environment. And with that, let\u2019s turn it to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey. Hi. Great color here. Hey. First, just on inflation, Rich, it sounds like supply disruptions and kind of the -- what it did in your factories was much more of a challenge than getting price to overcome cost. Can you just address that a little bit more and were you relatively price cost-neutral in the quarter? Richard Tobin : We were not price cost neutral in the quarter in the segments where you can see the dilution at the operating margin. So, it\u2019s a little bit of a two-fold story. Where we\u2019re getting the most price is where we\u2019re getting impacted the most, because not only you are driving with price increases, driving the topline, even in equilibrium that\u2019s dilutive to operating margins. So, when you\u2019re in a negative position, you get kind of a 300-point dilution. So the bad news is we\u2019re not in equilibrium in Q3. From here, we\u2019d begin to squeeze that down in Q4 and if conditions don\u2019t deteriorate go positive moving into 2022. Jeff Sprague : And then unrelated but the backlogs and what you\u2019re kind of pointing to here in Q4, it looks like at the midpoint, your Q4 revenue has guided down about 9% sequentially, which would be more than normal, and certainly seems high, especially relative to the backlog. So, could you just address that and give us a little more color on how you might be able to uncork these backlogs and the visibility, and maybe what a normal backlog situation would look like? Richard Tobin : Yeah. I think that we\u2019re hopeful that we can get out what we\u2019re projecting in our guidance. Clearly, not in the -- not only in the revenue but the EPS, we\u2019re driving towards the top end here. But it\u2019s a normal Q4 despite and Brad went over cash flow. We will run for cash somewhat at the end of the year. We have certain businesses that are seasonal that don\u2019t deliver much in December and then we lose production days just because of Thanksgiving and Christmas. So, we\u2019re talking about double-digit growth quarter-over-quarter into Q4, and we\u2019re going to endeavor to get it out, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Right. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. Richard Tobin : Hi. Brad Cerepak : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : Hey. Just to clarify on that last one, you said price cost neutral, so pricing was, I think, 3.5% or something like that, so roughly $60 million of kind of favorability. Do you mean on kind of an absolute basis that you had more cost inflation than that in the quarter? Richard Tobin : Yeah. I mean there\u2019s three buckets, right? There is raw materials, there\u2019s logistics and supply chain, and then there\u2019s business interruption costs that we incurred during the quarter. The vast majority of the negative impact is reflected in the segments that you can see, and a conservative view of what that cost was in the quarter is somewhere in the order of $25 million to $30 million in EBIT lost. That compresses in Q4 on a lower revenue line. Steve Tusa : Right. That\u2019s from the disruption you said, like, kind of like disruption\u2026 Richard Tobin : That\u2019s all three. Brad Cerepak : That\u2019s all it. Richard Tobin : That\u2019s all three. Steve Tusa : Okay. So then why wouldn\u2019t that be -- so then why wouldn\u2019t it be positive price cost, if that\u2019s the case? Richard Tobin : Because a lot of it is still in inventory, so you\u2019ve got that role based on -- you\u2019ve got the raw materials inventory and you\u2019ve got the orders in backlog and depending on when you took the orders and when they cycle through. So\u2026 Steve Tusa : Right. Richard Tobin : \u2026 two most effective businesses that we have, the price cost in total, including all three categories narrows from the number that I just gave you, but it does not get positive. Without getting granular here, it may get positive on raw materials, but not pick up logistics on the logistics side. From a total portfolio point of view, I think, that we are in neutrality in Q4. Brad Cerepak : Right. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then are these supply constraints, like, is there anything that really stands out, are there like onesies and twosies of components or is there something that really stands out, and ultimately could you give any visibility on kind of, I guess, the million-dollar question is timing of resolution on these things. I mean, are we going to be going into the second quarter of next year still kind of dealing with this stuff in your view? Richard Tobin : Well, look, I mean, as Brad mentioned, we\u2019re carrying the inventory, so we won\u2019t liquidate all of that in Q4. So to a certain extent, we are over ordering on the component side just because it\u2019s a little bit of a whackable. It was hydraulics back in Q2 and to a certain extent at the beginning of Q3. That\u2019s lightening up and now its electronic components. So, it\u2019s a myriad of stuff, but unfortunately, all it takes is one missing piece here. It seems like it\u2019s getting -- it\u2019s not getting worse. I guess is what I am saying. I am a bit concerned about policy decisions making it worse. I don\u2019t have a lot of faith in announcements about port activity having a demonstrable impact in the short run, quite frankly. But I think that because of the fact that we\u2019ve been over ordering to a certain extent ourselves, I think it should modulate. But I am not ready to prognosticate about how much better it gets in Q1 other than to say that we believe that we\u2019ve got positive pricing roll forward into Q1 and based on raw materials that the forward curves are constructive. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, guys. Rich, nice quarter. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : So you ended up recording mid-20% incrementals in Q3 and you\u2019re projecting something close to that in Q4. It\u2019s still kind of in your range or close to your range of that 25% to 35%. So you talked about price versus cost starting to turn, as you look out into 2022, how much confidence does it give you that you could deliver incrementals at or above 25% to 35%, given all of the ongoing projects you have? You\u2019ve got productivity projects in DP. You\u2019ve got that structural cost that you always talk about. So do you have more confidence, given how well you\u2019ve performed with these headwinds this quarter? Richard Tobin : I think that we are -- I think that what we believe that is structural in nature in terms of the inflation is the labor. So if we\u2019re constructive about raw mats coming down somewhat and we\u2019re constructive about the lagging effect of price increases and inventory turns, that we believe, as I mentioned in my comments, that we can bring back the margin profile of the biggest impacted business that we have. In any given year, we expect to offset inflationary inputs at the factory level with productivity. Now we\u2019ve got to do a little bit more of that just because of the labor inflation but I think that that\u2019s doable. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. And then maybe I can ask you specifically about DPPS. We know you\u2019ve been building out capacity in biopharma, you\u2019ve talked about that. I think you\u2019ve got some cyclical improvement in Precision Components. But this segment is up over 20% versus 2019 with a backlog that\u2019s up 90%. So I think people -- some people are worried about DPPS eventually running into more difficult comps. So based on your own organic investments, does DPPS stay one of your fastest growing segments and how would you say now that you -- can you maintain the recent margin performance that you\u2019ve had? Richard Tobin : Well, we get asked this every quarter and the answer is yes. As we talked about in the call, we have -- we\u2019re expanding capacity and we wouldn\u2019t be doing that, if we weren\u2019t proactive about the demand environment going into 2022. Do we get a little bit of margin fade due to mix? Maybe, but is it going to be material? No. So we look at it this way. We understand that this has been material in terms of the year-over-year profitability of the group. Would we rely on that level of profitability change moving forward from here? No. But I think that we\u2019ve got a lot of ammunition. Back to your other question about what we think that we can roll forward in the portfolio next year. So we don\u2019t need that kind of pickup next year, just relative to the size of the change in earnings this year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate it Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey. Good morning guys and thanks for being bold and being first of reporting for stupidity, one of the two, but nonetheless\u2026 Richard Tobin : Okay. Scott, go ahead. Scott Davis : Yeah. Rich, you talked a little bit about how you\u2019re strategically building inventory, are your customers\u2019 strategically building inventory too? Is there a chance that some of the channel\u2019s getting a little fat in certain SKUs? Richard Tobin : Not in inventory. I mean it\u2019s a big question. Look, one of the thing we\u2019ve been discussing all year is the backlogs are so large. Is that being influenced? Sure, it\u2019s being influenced, because the supply chain constraints are becoming so difficult. No one wants to live with that next year. So lead times are stretching out and that\u2019s reflected in the backlog to a certain extent. I am not aware and based on the yelling and screaming that goes on around here about getting the product out the door, that we\u2019ve got any channels that are carrying excess inventory. Pretty much right now, everything that we can get out the door, our customers and distributors will take. Scott Davis : Okay. And Rich, can you just help understand, you talked about curtailing some production. Are you talking about, I mean, logistically, help us understand what that means. Did you shut something down for a week and give everybody paid time-off? Is it just a shift here and there? I mean, what\u2019s the extent of when you do a shutdown like this and are you eating full labor costs and such in that time period or are there adjustments that are made with in that regard? Richard Tobin : Yeah. It\u2019s a mixed bag. We have -- at a certain point you can\u2019t have half built or three-quarter built units. You just need the logistics. If you think about refrigeration units, you think about ESG truck bodies, you think about vehicle lifts, you just get to the point where the cost of reworking those goods, putting in those last pieces of component parts as they arrive, the math doesn\u2019t make sense and it gets really complicated and then you just say we need to stop. Sometimes you stop for two or three days. Sometimes, you stop for a shift depending on inventory deliveries and everything else. But I would tell you that it would -- a lot of it is driven by the size of the goods, if you think about it that way. I mean, if you\u2019re thinking about it like a pump, you can -- we\u2019ve got enough warehousing space to take that. If you\u2019re thinking about truck bodies and you\u2019re thinking about refrigerated -- refrigeration units, you get to the point where you\u2019re just better off taking the whole machine down for two days or three days. And when you do so, you don\u2019t carry all the labor but you carry most of it. So the negative absorption is what you would expect. Scott Davis : Okay. Good luck in 4Q. Thanks, guys. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And we will take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to circle back, unfortunately, to this sort of price net of cost topic. Richard Tobin : Yeah. Julian Mitchell : Stepping back from the sort of quarterly back and forth, so for full year 2021, what is that net dollar price cost headwind, is it sort of $10 million that type of range? And then when we think about next year, do you think Dover should benefit from a lag as we see those forward cost curves come down, maybe that\u2019s reflected in the real costs coming in? What\u2019s the ability of your pricing to kind of hang in there relative to that cost normalization next year if we see it? Richard Tobin : Okay. Okay. The three components that we\u2019re talking, but we have -- I don\u2019t want to rewind the clock here, but we started in Q4 and Q1 of last year talking about raw material price cost, where we said at the time, we would be in neutrality, right? Then when we went from there to a labor inflationary environment and even more problematic supply chain and logistics, labor inflation, I am not even going to get into it. It\u2019s up to us to offset that just in terms of raw productivity. So where we are, and I think I gave you the number, it was $25 million to $30 million of negativity in the two segments that you see dilution in the quarter. We expect that to compress some in Q4, which is driven by two things, one is the revenue in Q4 relative to Q3 and the fact that you\u2019ve got a roll forward and the catch-up us on pricing as you work off older dated backlog. So as I was -- back to the question I was asked before, all things being equal, as that older dated backlog re-prices itself because of pricing actions taken through the year, that it becomes a negative -- it becomes a positive moving into Q1 under the assumption that things don\u2019t get worse from here and under the assumption that the market structure, the pricing in the market structure remains as it is today, which we believe it\u2019s going to, by the way. Julian Mitchell : Got it. And so through next year where you do get that spread or do you think the market is sort of too efficient for that? Richard Tobin : Well, we\u2019re going to have to fight it out Julian. And we\u2019ve taken the pain to make deliveries to our customers and we\u2019ve been having discussions with them that we\u2019re not re-pricing backlog in a lot of instances. So we are taking it through the P&L, which also means that as future prices of metals come down, we\u2019re also not re-pricing the backlog that we have and so our backlogs are actually up sequentially despite the fact having 15% growth. So it\u2019s not going to be easy but that\u2019s kind of the way that we\u2019re managing the process. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s very helpful. And just a last one on this point, so your gross margins up a lot in the first half, down slightly year-on-year in the third quarter. Should we assume by first quarter next year as things look today that it\u2019s up year-on-year again? Richard Tobin : Year-on-year again, you know what I don\u2019t have the gross margin for Q1 in my head. But I would assume that our projections for the majority of the portfolio are to grow the topline next year. I am not aware of negative mix -- segmental negative mix. So on absorption alone we would expect that. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Richard Tobin : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hey. Yes, guys. Good morning. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hey. Just in terms of supply chain disruption and folks talked about it, but could you quantify the magnitude of delayed shipments on third quarter revenue and if supply chain issues remained the same in fourth quarter? I mean, should we think about these showing up in 2022, I mean, what happens with all these delayed shipments? Richard Tobin : Well, first and foremost, our guidance incorporates our view of what happens going forward, number one. Number two, could we have shipped more in Q3? Clearly, we could have. I think that this argument about lost revenue is an interesting one, because everybody, I suppose, all market participants claimed lost revenue, because demand is high and supply constraints are tight. So monetizing that as lost is a little bit of a fool\u2019s game. We could have shipped out more in Q3. It would have reduced our backlog slightly is my presumption and I don\u2019t believe that it would allow us to ship more in Q4 materially. Andrew Obin : Got you. And can you just touch on cadence of bookings as you went through the third quarter and any early feel for changes here in the fourth quarter, I mean, clearly, the end market looks robust, but maybe a little bit more color? Richard Tobin : I think that the last time we did this was August and we said that, it was -- August is always a choppy month for bookings, so we would have more clarity as we went through the quarter. Clearly, they\u2019ve got better in September and October based on the results that we\u2019ve posted. My expectation that, they will slow on a run rate basis going into Q4 because essentially, Q4 is already in backlog for the most part. Andrew Obin : Got you. That makes sense. Thanks a lot. Richard Tobin : Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Richard Tobin : Hi, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So, hey, Rich, just maybe going back to the supply chain discussion for a little bit, maybe a bigger picture question here. You have had some announcements from the government that they\u2019re trying to ease the supply chain issues by going to like a 24x7 model at the ports. What I am hearing from you is that like you\u2019re not really seeing much of an improvement at this point, but I want to make sure that like I am getting that correctly on the latest data point? Richard Tobin : Yeah. Joe Ritchie : And then just very curious like, what would you do, if you had to do like proactively change policy decisions, what would you do to try to ease some of this burden? Richard Tobin : Going and just announcing 24x7 operations as if you have all the employees and all of the moving parts to make that happen overnight is naive. I think the intent is there. But I think that if there\u2019s -- we don\u2019t believe there\u2019s going to be any demonstrable change in performance between now and the end of the year. It\u2019s just too complex of an ecosystem. I am not an economist. We\u2019ve been having -- if you go back and look at our comments all year long, this notion of transitory inflation and blaming used car prices has been naive at best. It\u2019s been manageable for corporates as corporates have priced inflation, but that is a how long is a piece of string argument. So coupled with a lot of other proposed agenda items that one conceivably could say would cause additional inflation and port congestion, I am not entirely sure that that\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s well thought out. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And I guess, maybe just kind of thinking about this pricing, the backlog. Clearly, backlog is in great shape going into next year, maybe even beyond. I guess the concern in the market is your ability to make sure you can get pricing or re-price portions of the backlog to meet what the cost environment looks like and so as you kind of look at your backlog and your portfolio, are there any areas where there\u2019s maybe a little bit more concern on potentially re-pricing the backlog or should we feel good going into 2022 that the margin on that backlog is in good shape? Richard Tobin : We are not re-pricing backlog materially in any portion of the group. We\u2019re actually doing quite the opposite. We\u2019re holding pricing in the backlog to the detriment of margins as we push the product out the door, because we believe that preserving our customer -- our strategic customer relationships and not forcing demand destruction is a more favorable equation than having fights about re-pricing backlog when we\u2019re actually re-pricing all new orders as we progress through the year. So the only negative scenario, that ends up being a rolling credit unless one wants to make an assumption about inflationary inputs getting worse going into 2022 from where the baseline is right now. Joe Ritchie : Super helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Hi, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Rich, just maybe first on some of these kind of bottlenecks that you guys are seeing. At what point, just based on what you can see in terms of what comes up next in the backlog or some sort of business mix, do you think you can get past that 2Q high watermark for what is able to get out the door? I imagine seasonality plays a role as well, but is that something that you have line of sight to right now and the way you guys are thinking about the next couple of quarters? Richard Tobin : I guess, I am allowed to make one positive comment since we\u2019re going to deconstruct all this. Remember that our margins are up quarter-to-quarter for the remaining here. Yeah, look, I mean, at the end of the day, Q3 was tough, I mean, for [Technical Difficulty] we still had COVID Delta going on at the time with absenteeism driven by that, which we\u2019re largely behind. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s fundamentally changed in our ability to manage output. It\u2019s been a little bit of a struggle. I think that we were, I guess, a little bit disappointed on the labor equation. We had projected it to get materially better in Q3 and it got a little bit better as we exited Q3, but the first couple of months were quite difficult. So I am not overly concerned on our ability to get to high watermarks and we\u2019ve got some relatively robust projections for revenue growth for 2022 and we\u2019ve got the footprint to deliver it. So, again, unless we want to make an assumption that supply constraints deteriorate from here, which we don\u2019t believe then I think that we\u2019re positioned appropriately just by the fact that we\u2019ve over ordered on the inventory side, at least we start off on the front foot. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just specifically on Pumps & Process Solutions. I mean, you guys have a mountain of backlog there. It doesn\u2019t seem like the order intake is really slowing. I mean, just if you get down that backlog to a normal level and I don\u2019t know what normal is anymore, but it seems like that business sort of has to grow double digits next year. I mean, a little early on 2022, but like that isn\u2019t a long cycle business and you got more backlog than maybe you know what to do with, like what\u2019s missing in that equation? Richard Tobin : Well, I think, we mentioned it before. We\u2019re going to get into 2022 and if we\u2019re all positive about input costs and logistics and supply chain, backlogs are going to drop, right? Because lead times are going to shrink and everybody is going to panic and you shouldn\u2019t. So, I think, that the bottomline is, because of these constraints, backlog is good, it gives us a lot of visibility going into the year and our expectation that backlog -- that total backlog will fade proportionally, but that\u2019s actually a good sign. I am not going to give out growth rates by segment for 2022, as I mentioned in my comments. I think that we\u2019ve done our early looks at what 2022 is setting up to be and I think from a top line point of view, which is portfolio wide we\u2019re constructive. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Works for me. Thanks, Rich. Operator : And we will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with all your questions. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Hi, Nigel. Nigel Coe : Hey. So, obviously, the backlogs, not so much the backlog, the book-to-bill ratios have been off the scale. So I understand the lead times impacting backlogs, but book-to-bill has been very strong now for the last three or four quarters. I really want you to address the question of what\u2019s changed and what\u2019s different about this recovery versus the last couple, which have been pretty anemic, so what do you think is driving such strength here? And then maybe just address, you talked about how you\u2019re preordering or maybe buffering some of the components. To what extent do you think your customers are doing the same thing as well? Richard Tobin : Okay. Nigel, I think, I answered the question before that we do channel checks right now and we are not aware of inventory of our products being elevated in any of our end markets. Clearly, order rates are a reflection of backlog build and that\u2019s why order rates continue to be elevated and backlog has not come down despite the fact that the topline growth has been good. It will, like, the order -- the backlog will fade over time. I don\u2019t want to repeat myself over and over again here. So what\u2019s driving the recovery? I think a couple of things. From a Dover point of view, I think that the portfolio is a lot different than it was in the past. I think that clearly it looks like we\u2019re moving into a CapEx cycle in a lot of our end markets. We discussed refrigeration before, but that seems, we are getting quite proactive about the energy complex, for example, and I think that we\u2019ve got some market exposures with the biopharma platform that we\u2019ve had in the past that you can\u2019t compare. So, overall, I think, it\u2019s a combination of we\u2019ve expanded capacity in markets that are growing. So we\u2019ve got available product and the -- and that the profile of the end markets at Dover has changed meaningfully over the last five years. Nigel Coe : Great. But the CapEx cycle is what I was trying to get at. You sound pretty confident we were in a CapEx cycle, that\u2019s great. And then the portfolio slide was really helpful, because your M&A has been -- maybe each deal flies by the radar a little bit, but when you add them together, they\u2019re meaningful. I mean, are you happy to maintain this kind of cadence with smaller bolt-on type deals but additive in aggregate? So do you think that there could be one or two larger opportunities down the road? Richard Tobin : We look at larger opportunities all the time. The problem with larger opportunities, the bigger the opportunity, the more it attracts in terms of interest, because of just scale and so pricing becomes difficult. If we look at where value has been created for Dover, historically, it\u2019s these bolt-ons that use the network effect of Dover that have been high value returners. So, I don\u2019t think we will ever stop doing the small ones, because I think that we\u2019ve got a lot of conviction behind that process. But would we like to do some bigger ones? Sure, we would. We just need to find the appropriate priced deals out there. Nigel Coe : That\u2019s great. Thanks, Rich. Operator : And our last question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Hi, Deane. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Deane Dray : Hey. Maybe we will stick with M&A but on the divestiture side. Richard Tobin : Okay. Deane Dray : And maybe just put in context the Unified Brand divestiture. Is it truly a one-off opportunistic divestiture or might it be the start of a pivot away from selectively in Refrigeration & Food Equipment? Richard Tobin : We evaluate annually market structure participation by all of our operating companies. The fact of the matter is over the last three years to four years the market structure in Foodservice Equipment has changed for a variety of reasons and we just did not believe that, Unified Brands within the Dover family was going to be able to extract the value and that it was more appropriately owned by someone that has the scale to participate in that structure. Deane Dray : That\u2019s helpful. Could maybe -- you\u2019re not going to give specifics, I understand, but just how does that pipeline of potential divestitures, the pruning that you\u2019re doing, where does that stand? Richard Tobin : There\u2019s not a lot, right? Like I said, we evaluate it annually. We\u2019ve got a view of the value creation that\u2019s embedded in each piece of the portfolio. But as a multi-industrial, if we were to get an inbound request where the value paid is in excess or equal to the value that we think that we could create then we would have to take a look at it. But right now [Technical Difficulty] that we\u2019re actively looking at. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just last one, to go back on pricing. Richard Tobin : Okay. Deane Dray : Rich, you talked about this during the quarter that you felt that a fourth price increase could actually start to result in some pushback demand destruction. You answered the question not re-pricing backlog. But just broadly within the businesses, are you seeing that sort of price elasticity coming through where a fourth price increase might be problematic? Richard Tobin : It depends, Deane. We have not been aggressive on re-pricing a backlog, because we take seriously our commitment when we accept an order that we accept to deliver against those commercial terms. But having said that, we have been sequentially moving on price primarily because of raw materials not so much due to labor and supply chain. Deane Dray : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Richard Tobin : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover\u2019s third quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrey Galiuk, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrey Galiuk. Please go ahead, sir. Andrey Galiuk : Thank you, [Tani] [Ph]. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. This call will be available on our Web site for playback through February 17, and the audio portion will be archived for three months. Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our Web site. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements that are subject to uncertainties and risks. We caution everyone to be guided in their analysis of Dover by referring to our Form 10-K and our most recent Form 10-Q for a list of factors that could cause our results to differ from those anticipated in any forward-looking statement. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements except as required by law. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thank you, Andrey, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on page three. We are thankful for the extraordinary efforts of our Dover team members which enabled us to deliver strong operating results amidst challenging conditions during 2021. We are also grateful to our customers who trusted us with their business while adapting their supply chains and business models to this rapidly changing and demanding environment. The resilience and creativity of our teams and the durability of our customer relationships were the key elements of our success this year, and we are committed to build upon those pillars in 2022, and mobilized to deliver another strong year of performance. All right, let's go on to the quarterly and full-year results. We delivered strong and better than expected results in fourth quarter and the full-year, posting organic revenue growth of 11% and 15%, respectively. Our margin conversion for the year was strong, and we delivered segment margin increase of over 200 basis points for the year, driven by volume growth, productivity gains, and our center-led enterprise capabilities. We are satisfied with this accomplishment in the face of the well-chronicled input shortages, supply chain constraints, and COVID-driven quarantines and absenteeism that became increasingly challenging during the Omicron period of Q4. As we mentioned in the opening remarks, we battled through as best we could under the circumstances, but we cannot help but be very frustrated by the continuing guidance on mandates and deadlines. It seems, often, that we have learned very little in the past 24 months. We complimented our strong operational execution with value-creating organic and inorganic growth investments. We deployed $1.1 billion in nine highly strategic bolt-on acquisitions, and also completed the divestiture of our non-core food service equipment platform, on December 1. These investments advanced our deliberate strategy to expand into markets with secular growth opportunities. Recognizing the recent changes to our portfolio and to better reflect the nature of the markets and customers served by our businesses, as well as the contributions to revenue, growth, and profits, we have changed the name of our Fueling Solutions segment to Clean Energy and Fueling, and our Refrigeration and Food Equipment segment to Climate and Sustainability Technologies. Looking ahead to 2022, we enter the year with constructive optimism despite the ever-evolving operating environment and geopolitical clouds. We believe that growth conditions are still with us, but it is critical that policies are enacted or not enacted to continue this trajectory. A methodical monetary tightening is deemed necessary, and I agree that it is. I would urge caution on the pace of any policy decisions in the regulatory environment or taxation if one wants to preserve GDP expansion trajectory. As COVID and its effects subside, we desperately need policy pragmatism with a bias towards policy that foster economic growth. Demand conditions across the majority of the portfolio remain favorable as evidenced by our strong sustained bookings in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, with the book-to-bill each quarter above one, even with the aforementioned double-digit revenue growth. Our backlog, of $3.2 billion, is up 84% versus this time last year, which allows us to better plan our capacity, production, and inventory; a major benefit in today's constrained operating environment. While we expect these operational challenges in supply chain and labor availability to continue into early '22, we do not expect operating conditions -- we do expect operating conditions and price material spreads to improve as the year progresses. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver robust top line growth, margin expansion, and EPS accretion in 2022. We are therefore forecasting full-year revenue guidance of 7% to 9% organic growth, and adjusted EPS of $8.45 to $8.65 per share. I will skip slide four, which provides more a more detailed overview of the results, so let's go on to slide five. Engineered Products revenue was up 16% organically in the quarter as demand remained favorable across all businesses. Vehicle Services posted a strong top line quarter, and market indicators remain positive. Environmental Services Group revenue was up year-over-year; with both bookings and backlog remain robust moving into 2022. Industrial Automation demand remained high, posting its strongest bookings quarter of the year, while deliveries were negatively impacted by output challenges in America and Europe. Aerospace and Defense posted a solid year-over-year growth, with good momentum behind our recent Espy acquisition, the recovery of industrial winches continues with all end markets trending positive. Despite the heightened demand, margin performance in the segment remains negatively impacted by the combination of input cost inflation and input shortages, with notable impact from COVID-related absenteeism, particularly late in the quarter where we ran at over 20% rates, in some instances, at the height of Omicron. In the fourth quarter, Engineered Products was the only segment that had a negative price cost spread, largely driven by raw materials and logistics costs. This remains our most challenged segment in the current operating environment that we have line of sight to improve margin outlook as the price cost spread turns positive in 2022. Incremental margin conversion is expected to gain steam through the year as we cycle through inventory, and we begin shipping off a strong backlog that was priced in the second-half of 2021. Clean Energy & Fueling was down 4% organically in the quarter against a difficult comparable from 2020, when we saw the high watermark of EMV demand. Additionally, volume was constrained by our customers' construction, labor slowdown, and component shortages, as well as COVID absenteeism in Europe. Booking trends and backlog in the aboveground business remain constructive, based on early market feedback and trajectory we believe that we have a winning pro with the Anthem dispenser. Conversely, demand trends for belowground equipment have picked up in North America, and deliveries and vehicle wash continued their upward trend most notably in access terminal and controller business that we acquired a year ago. Our recent Clean Energy acquisitions had a minimal impact on our Q4 results. However, backlogs in these businesses are strong. Margins were down in the quarter, primarily due to the lower volumes, product mix, absenteeism-driven inefficiencies and loss fixed-cost absorption. Full-year results in this business were strong and better than we initially forecasted early in the year on robust growth, productivity and favorable mix. Sales in Imaging & Identification grew 3% organically. The core marketing and coding business was strong on comparable volume though a short of components on some -- and some order push outs reduced volumes in printers. Our serialization and brand management software business continues to grow ahead of expectations when we're working diligently to add additional resources here, as we integrate and scale the business. The digital textile business continues its gradual recovery, and was up against a low bar comparable quarter, but it is still not recovered to pre-COVID levels. Q4 margins in Imaging & ID improved by 40 basis points year-over-year, as mix and price more than offset cost inflation and input availability issues. Full-year results were strong. The segment delivered 8% organic growth and 170 basis points of margin expansion are good volumes and productivity initiatives. Pumps & Process Solutions posted another strong quarter at 30% organic growth. Revenue for our CPC business was up double digits. We completed a clean room expansion project for this business in December, and anticipation of another strong growth year in 2022. Industrial and biopharma pumps were up on broad based end customer demand across all geographies.  We are pleased with the performance of the flow meter business within Em-tec, which we acquired in 2020, its biopharma sales have doubled in 2021. Precision component was up as the business continues its recovering on improving demand in their broader industry exposure. Polymer Processing was up in the quarter due to strong demand for palletizers and gear pumps as well as strong order rates and recycling equipment and consumables particularly in the U.S. and China. Margins expanded by a robust 740 basis points in the quarter and 790 basis points in the year on strong volumes, fixed cost absorption, favorable product mix and pricing. Top line results in Climate & Sustainability Technologies continue to be robust posting 13% organic growth. SWEP our heat exchange of business capped off the year, posting all-time records and bookings revenue and margin and carries a strong backlog into 2022. The business was strong across all geographies and end markets with particularly favorable demand in the EMEA for heat pumps, driven by regulatory requirements. We have been adding additional capacity in several geographies to meet forecasted future demand. Belvac, our provider production solutions for beverage packaging posted a revenue decline in the fourth quarter on difficult comparable driven by project timing. As we know, this business was up significantly in 2021, part of a multi-year secular shift toward more environmentally friendly aluminum cans with demand far exceeding the current installed capacity. Demand in our food retail business remains robust with elevated bookings and backlog levels. Our systems business in the U.S. and Europe continued its robust growth in deliveries and orders for natural CO2 refrigeration systems. Demand for door cases remained elevated as well. However, we continue to face labor constraints and subcomponent supply shortages that delayed shipments which necessitated intermitted production curtailments negatively impacting margins. We've instituted a number of price increases, which we expect to positively contribute to margins and conversion into 2022. Margins were flat, largely flat as the quarter as excellent operating performances swept, offset refrigeration headwinds despite the smaller revenue base. This segment demonstrated good progress in 2021, 22% of growth after a very modest 3% decline in 2020 and 230 basis point margin expansion despite multiple operational challenges as the year presented. With a strong backlog, we expect a continued robust progress in 2022. And I'll pass it on to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich, and good morning everyone. Let's go to slide six. On the top is the Revenue Bridge. Our top line organic revenue increased by 11% in the quarter, with all segments, except Clean Energy & Fuel posting growth. FX was a 1% or 12 million headwind to the top line, M&A added $17 million net to the to the top line in the quarter, a product of $26 million from acquisitions partially offset by $9 million from the Unified Brands divestiture. The revenue breakdown by geography reflects strong growth in North American and Asia, and solid growth across Europe and the rest of the world. The U.S., our largest market posted 16% organic growth in the quarter on solid trading conditions and industrial [wrenches] [Ph], vehicle aftermarket, biopharma, and polymer processing. All of Asia was up 15% organically, and growth in biopharma, industrial pumps, marketing, coding, and heat exchangers. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia, was up 17% organically in the quarter. Europe grew by 7% in the quarter on strong shipments and precision components, biopharma, industrial pumps, natural refrigerant systems, and heat exchangers for heat pumps, partially offset by order timing in sustainable beverage can making. Moving to the bottom of the page, bookings were up 22% organically in the quarter, reflecting continued broad-based momentum across the portfolio. Bookings helped drive our consolidated backlog to $3.2 billion, up 15% sequentially, inclusive of backlogs from our recent acquisitions. In the quarter, we saw organic growth across four of the five segments. Let's go to the earning bridges on slide seven. On the top chart, adjusting segment EBIT was up $47 million and adjusted EBIT margin improved 60 basis points as improved volumes continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing offset input cost inflation and production stoppages. On the bottom of the chart, adjusted net earnings improved by $34 million as higher segment EBIT more than offset higher corporate expenses and higher taxes. Deal expenses primarily related to our clean energy acquisitions were 11 million in the quarter, representing approximately $0.06 of adjusted EPS headwind. The effective tax rate, excluding discrete tax benefits and gains on the sale of businesses was approximately 21.7% for the quarter compared to 21.1% in the prior year. Discrete tax benefits were $10.3 million for the quarter, or $2.1 million higher than 2020, for approximately $0.01 year over year EPS impact. After-tax right-sizing and other costs were 22 million in the quarter reflective of our ongoing productivity and right-sizing initiatives, including non-cash asset charges of approximately $16 million. Now on slide eight. In 2021, we generated $944 million of free cash flow, a slight increase over the prior year. Free cash flow conversion stands at 12% of revenue for the year despite and over $300 million investment in working capital. As we discussed last quarter, we remain focused on delivering against our customer's strong order rates, and we are carrying high inventory levels to ensure we can meet the current demand into next year. With that, I'm going to pass it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Okay, thanks, Brad. I'm on slide nine, which shows our progress in 2021 against the capital allocation priorities we outlined at our Investor Day in 2019. We have a strong collection of businesses, and our first priority is ensuring we can continue to win in the market through organic investments, supporting growth capacity, digitization, innovation, and productivity. We deployed over $170 million capital expenditure in 2021 towards growth and productivity enhancements, as well as maintenance of our asset base. Notably, we invested over $14 million in digital products and digital and e-commerce, which allow us to reach our goal of over 1 billion in e-commerce revenue last year with no touch by customer service. This represents over 10 times the volume we processed in 2018. And our 2020 goal is to double our 2021 volume. Our next priority is inorganic growth. Last year, we deployed 1.1 billion into nine highly synergistic bolt-on acquisitions including two larger deals Acme, and RegO, which we closed in December. All these acquisitions enhance our portfolio by increasing our exposure to markets with structural demand, growth, outlook. Our pipeline, and acquisition capacity remains strong and we expect to remain active on this front in 2022. Our third priority is to return capital to our shareholders that we again raised our dividend in 2021 as we have done for the past 66 years Let's move to Slide 10, we provide more color and some of our organic investments. So, I won't go into the specifics any of these projects individually, but you'll see that our investments are substantial in size and represent a broad variety of productivity improvement and digitization initiatives as well as investments and capacity expansion, and new product development projects. These investments provide compelling financial returns and our proactive capacity expansions have allowed us to win share in the tight supply market. Slide 11 includes our current view of demand outlook and operational environment for 2022 by summit segment and how margin drivers are expected to trend over time and provides context of how we're thinking about our full-year guidance, which I'll get to shortly. We expect top line and engineered products to remain robust based on solid backlog and sustain high bookings across the business. All market indicators and vehicle aftermarket continue to remain positive and miles driven having fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels and used cars prices remaining elevated. Orders for rough use trucks and software solutions are robust, with new order rates pushing well into the second-half of '22, momentum and industrial automation and industrial witches should continue on the back of the solid bookings quarter of all end markets contributing to growth aerospace and defense is expecting growth on positive order trends largely driven by Europe. We expect headwinds from negative cost to continue in the first-half of the year getting sequentially better as the year progressed. We expect this segment to be the only one with negative price cost spread in the first quarter. Input availability, mostly labor absenteeism, freeze from recent Omicron surge is expected to negatively impact production efficiency in the first quarter, but should subside for the balance of the year. All in we expect margins for the segment in the first-half of the year to largely mirror the second-half of '21, then to improve meaningfully for the full-year driven by volume leverage and pricing. We expect clean energy and fueling to post low single-digit organic growth for the full-year on solid growth and below ground vehicle wash and software solutions. Demand outlook and bookings of our recently acquired clean energy businesses are very robust and they are off to a good start. As you know, we don't adjust acquisition related amortization out of our adjusted segment earnings margins due to sizable acquisition related amortization charges from our recent deals in the segment, the operating margin will be compressed in the first quarter of 2022. Excluding about 40 million of incremental deal-related amortization expenses and '22, we expect full-year margin conversion to be in line with broader portfolio. Demand conditions in imaging and identification are expected to continue the positive trajectory into 2022. Our core marketing and coding business expect to maintain its steady GDP like growth rate, serialization and brand protection software should contribute positively to robust -- on robust bookings and backlog. Digital textile printing is recovering and is expect to take another year or two to reach pre-pandemic levels as apparel producers take a cautious stance with new capital outlays. We expect margin in the segment to continue to improve in 2022. Pumps and process solutions should see another year of solid performance. Demand for biopharma applications remains robust driven by demand for COVID vaccines, as well as growth in cell and gene therapies and expansion of MRNA technology to other applications. We are completing the second phase of our cleanroom expansions and automation to ensure we can keep up with demand and we have broken ground on the construction of a new facility. Additionally, our connector business is experiencing robust growth in new thermal applications such as data center and supercomputing and EV charging. Trading conditions and industrial pumps are strong driven by robust and customer demand, plastics and polymers equipment business carries a solid backlog into 2022 with good market conditions and visibility especially in China, the U.S. and recycling solutions. Precision components continued its upward trajectory aided by OEM new builds and increasing activities at refineries and petrochemical plants. We expect margin performance to remain robust for the segment on volume growth, operational execution and positive price cost dynamics and climate and sustainability technologies we expect to post high single digit organic growth this year driven by its large backlog, and sustained elevated order rates, new orders and core food retail business have been healthy across product segments and the tailwinds from our leadership position and natural refrigerants are driving outsized growth of our CO2 systems business. As Omicron induced labor shortages abate in the first quarter, we expect volumes of door cases to recover with backlog stretching well into the second-half of the year. Our heat exchanger businesses positioned well on strong order rates across all geographies. Our Belvac packaging business continues to work through its record backlog. They are booked for 2022 and are taking orders for 2023. We expect to have our new R&D center and full can line completed in the first-half of the year. We expect margins to improve significantly in 2022. As improved volume leverage positive, price cost dynamics, productivity gains from our automation initiatives, and positive product and business mix should more than offset any lingering operational challenges related to component and labor shortages in the first quarter. All right, so before wrapping up and move into Q&A, let's try to square the circle here and sum up all the moving parts from our 2021 position to our full-year guidance. At the opening of this call, I said our results were better than expected. That was not a reference to external consensus estimates, but a comment about our operating margin performance versus our internal forecasts. Without the significant Omicron production and productivity losses which were not in our base forecast, we would have shipped more product in Q4 resulting in higher sales and cash flow, but lower consolidated margin on product mix. As a result of this, while we do get the benefit of carrying higher backlogs into 2022, we have not cleared as much higher cost inventory and have not realized all the benefits of past pricing actions embedded in that backlog. This will result in the calendar re-visitation of absolute earnings and earnings growth and especially segment operating margin being more back end loaded. And a typical year as a result of this date delayed backlog for us. A few implications of this dynamic, number one we approved an operating margin expectations for Q1 and encourage those modeling quarterly forecasts to exercise the same level of prudence. Number two, it is a good sign of backlogs gradually deplete during the year as it will be driven by higher production performance as labor availability and supply chains improve. Lastly, if both these dynamics play out as forecasted, we can expect inventory levels to drop supporting increased operating cash flow in 2022. So let's move to slide 13, which hopefully removes the quarterly noise and gives us some view of post pandemic full-year performance. Here we provide a bridge between our adjusted EPS in 2021 and 2022. We expect to generate double-digit EPS growth again this year driven by solid organic top line growth, much of which is currently in backlog as well as healthy full-year margin conversion and the positive impact from acquisition close in 2021. And so let's wrap up to Slide 14 to put our results and guide into the longer-term perspective. Our strategy has driven significant value creation for our shareholders over the last several years, as evidenced by the total shareholder return driven by underappreciated top line growth, cumulative margin expansion of 440 basis points, healthy cash flow generation and capital redeployment. We believe that our playbook offers us significant runway to continue delivering attractive cycle requirements over the coming years. And with that let us move to the Q&A. Andrey? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, everybody. Richard Tobin : Hi, Scott. Brad Cerepak : Hi, Scott. Scott Davis : There was a lot of detail on there, and I'd be lying if I said I followed every single word. But maybe we can start with just a little bit more color. It seems like this absenteeism and cost issues kind of lingering into 1Q here. Is it getting -- are things getting any better or are they just as bad now as they were kind of in 4Q -- Richard Tobin : Well, I guess -- yes, I guess, now that we've disposed with the federal mandate, hopefully, I mean that was not helpful at all, it is getting better. I think that the quarantine period being halved has helped. So, it's not as bad as the peak, which was probably in December, but it is lingering somewhat into January, but it's not as bad. Scott Davis : This cash flow guide is pretty solid. Does that imply there's going to be some work-down on working capital or are you at working capital levels that are kind of more, I would say, new normal given the supply chain messes out there or do you have some flush-out in '22? Richard Tobin : Yes, I mean I -- look, we expected to ship that. Now, whether we would have been caught up in receivables, who is to say? But my view is we would have expected to maybe have a slight increase in inventory based on the revenue. But our expectation for 2022, if we get this right, which we expect we will, is that we're going to give back that build net of revenue increase for the year. So, I expect to do better in working capital in 2022 than we did in '21. Brad Cerepak : Yes, I would just add I think we have a modest forecast of inventory drawdown. Depending on how the year progresses, there could be come incremental there. Scott Davis : Good luck, guys. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : We'll go now to Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Steve Tusa : You guys should change your name to Dover Technologies or something like that, or soft -- actually not now because the growth is now selling off, so, say, maybe something different. The change in the name is interesting though. Does that mean you're keeping refrigeration? Richard Tobin : Yes, it's in our forecast for 2022. Steve Tusa : Okay. Richard Tobin : Look, at the end of the day is we can't call it Food Equipment anymore since we disposed of the food equipment business. So, by and large, we had to rename it. The fact of the matter is, and I don't want to get cheeky about ESG-driven nomenclature here, is that the fastest growing portions of that segment are in sustainability technologies, it's SWEP, and our CO2 systems, and Belvac, which are all driven, we would argue, by a shift to meet ESG compliance, whether that's regulatory-driven or driven by other matters. So, I get it, it looks a little bit cheeky on our part, but it is what's growing within the portfolio. Steve Tusa : Yes. And then, you mentioned, I think, asking us to use prudence in our modeling is a lot to ask, I think. Can you be a little more specific about kind of like first quarter, maybe even second quarter kind of dynamics on sales and margins? Richard Tobin : Yes. I think that that first quarter will look more or less like Q4. I think that it'll move around a little bit, segment by segment, and I would imagine a little bit better than Q4. But, at the end of the day, some of the headwinds we had in Q4 we're going to carry into Q1, a lot of that driven by, as Scott asked, the lingering effects of absenteeism, which we're still dealing with a little bit right now. Logistics costs haven't come down a lot. But more importantly, because of our inability to flush backlog in Q4, what we would have expected to be catching up on price cost dynamic is a bit delayed. But that's all -- that's all incorporate into our -- the full-year number. Steve Tusa : Yes. And what do you mean by that as on an absolutely basis, what you're talking about? Richard Tobin : Yes, on an absolute basis. Steve Tusa : Okay. Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Richard Tobin : All right, thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Hey. Just back on the new Clean Tech segment, whether or not the refrigeration stays or go, I wouldn't expect you to address today, Rich, necessarily. But do you actually see scope to do some additions in that area? You have legitimately transformed the Fueling segment, right, with some interesting deals. Are there kinds of logical extensions to SWEP or Belvac or other things that are adjacent to those businesses that could be in your M&A pipeline? Richard Tobin : There are. But the beauty of those two businesses is the fact that they're so concentrated in terms of the supply base. So, there's not a lot of M&A you can really do. But if you look where we've been spending organic capital, we've actually been deploying proportionately quite a bit to SWEP and Belvac on organic capacity expansion. So, I'm not ruling M&A out because there are some interesting adjacencies around it, but what we've been doing is just investing behind growth. And I think that SWEP will be finishing, in 2022, an expansion in all four of the geographies they participate in, for example. And I think that we've put in 15 years worth of CapEx into Belvac over the last 18 months or so. So, it's more of organic play, I think. Jeff Sprague : Okay. And just on the pumps business, I mean the results really are quite remarkable. To what extent would you say there's temporary COVID benefits running through biopharma or do you just see more of kind of a broader wave of investment and displacement of kind of, maybe, non-disposable technologies and other things driving that business? So, I guess the question is really just around the sustainability of these growth rates? Richard Tobin : Yes, well, the growth rates are going to come down. I mean let's call a spade a spade here. I mean, everything get clocked in for, what, 30% for the year, something like that. So, they're going to come down over time. And we don't have that kind of growth rate for that business embedded into our forecast for 2022. We also do not embed in our forecast any margin dilution because of COVID demand roll-off, because we think that the fundamental demand for the -- for those products is solid. And I would have hoped that [Danaher] [Ph] could have done a better job talking about it since they are a market participant in the same space. We believe that the growth rate will come down as COVID demand begins to roll off. We don't envision it going negative in '22, nor do we think that margins are going to be negatively impacted. Jeff Sprague : And maybe just last one, just back on price cost. So, it sounds like the entire company should be price-cost positive in Q2. Is that correct? And when you're talking about price-cost I guess flipping into the positive, are we talking dollars, margins, or both? Richard Tobin : The answer to the first question is yes, so the entire company in Q2. And yes again in terms of margin enhancement, especially in Engineered Products. Jeff Sprague : Great, thanks for the color. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Richard Tobin : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hey. Just a question in terms of just [hopes on] [Ph] biopharma and just internal organic CapEx opportunities versus M&A, just how much growth can you drive organically by expanding biopharma capacity? And just thinking beyond COVID, do you think there is a real opportunity there? Richard Tobin : I hope so since we're greenfielding a new facility for it right now, as we speak. Yes, look, I mean we were not able to keep up with customer demand in '21. I think that we did better than some of our competitors, meaning, I think, that we captured growth opportunities. But even with that capture, I think that we were, at certain points of the year disappointing our customers with our ability to serve. So, that was what drove the decision about expanding capacity. And I think, we greenfield the facility up in Minneapolis in 2019, it's sold out. So, that's why we're expanding there. And in our disposable pump business in Germany, we are bringing assembly operations with expansion to clean room in the United States for that particular product. So, our preferred path is inorganic investment to dry growth, because that's where our returns are the highest, but having, and as we've discussed many times, look, there's no secret that these are really interesting pieces of the market and they attract very high pricing. So, we're going to have to be selective on the M&A side. I think we have some interesting things that we're looking at for sure, but I think that we can do this simultaneously inorganic and organic. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a question on your business model, a, you're growing the e-commerce sales, I think over $1 billion, imagine you getting some sales efficiencies, but just a, how far can you take this model? And b, is there a generally greater structural ability to go direct to customers versus through distribution post-COVID? Thank you. Richard Tobin : Well, let me answer the second one -- second question first, because it's easier. No, I don't think -there's a -- our plan here is not to go around distribution. Our plan here to put in e-commerce platforms is a couple things, right? I mean, it's a cost savings issue, but I think clearly the real benefit of moving to e-commerce platform form is the S&OP process gets a lot slicker inventory management gets a lot better and you can centralize pricing rather than having distributed pricing around the world. So, yes, it's a bit of cost savings, but the real benefit is operational over time and it's not a kind of go-to-market platform and we expect to continue to sell through distribution. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Rich, maybe you can give us a little more color into your confidence level that margin can turn more positive in DP. Do you need your productivity projects in ESG and VSG to complete before you get the margin turn? And then the business obviously is steel heavy. So, with steel rolling a bit here, does it give you more confidence in the turn into just a lag as some of the businesses backlog driven? Richard Tobin : We were negative price cost for 2021 because of the catch up on the raw material versus price because the cycle time in terms of the inventory turns is just more difficult. Look putting the labor issues aside. So, on that alone, we've priced for raw materials inbound through the year, which we believe rolls positive in Q2 based on our forecast for production performance. And what that does, all things being equal is go back to historical operating margins that you would see from ESG and VSG back in the 2019 pre-COVID period as kind of expectation number one. The investments we're making are longer term investments that should be accretive to that '19 kind of benchmark, but we will get that over time. So, we may see some of that in '21 or in '22, but that's going to take some period of time. We're re-outfitting both of the main plants for those businesses. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. And then, I'm going to ask you the old bookings question in the sense that bookings did not slow as you thought. I think we all understand that bookings will slow, but do you see an environment at least right now where the high level of bookings you're seeing is relatively sustainable? And how do we think about whether there is conservatism in your new '22 organic guide versus the backlog that's up obviously over 80%? Richard Tobin : Nothing like going first, I bet that -- I bet our revenue guide is not conservative when we're all said and done here, but I'll take your question anyway. Look bookings are going to slow. I mean, we've got businesses that are relatively short cycle that are bit booking into Q3. I mean, it's just inexplicable to me that there's any even need for our customers to go be beyond there at this point, right. I think we're going to get hit and it better happen, because if it doesn't happen, that means that supply chain issues are not resolving ourselves in '22 and we expect that to get progressively better. So, strangely, it's going to be a good thing if bookings decline in '22, relative to the rate that we saw in '21. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful. Thanks, Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : We'll going now to Mircea Dobre with Baird. Your line is open. Mircea Dobre : Yes. Thank you. Just sort of sticking with this theme on supply chain, I'm curious as to what you're seeing as far as your own components and your own purchases in terms of availability. I would imagine that, EP is probably the area where you're seeing the biggest challenge, but I'm kind of curious, one how that's changing into some of the other segments that might be experiencing this as well. Richard Tobin : I don't think that there's any segment that's immune to it. It's just -- if you step back and you think about the nature of the product, anything that's capital goods like has got a lot of raw material exposure, and it's got a lot of complexity because just the size and the dimension of the product, as opposed to something like a connector that's made out of injection multi-plastic at the end of the day, that's more of a capacity constraint and maybe some logistics. So, the locus of the issue on supply chain is very much within engineered products, but it's not to say end-to-end refrigeration because that is more -- refrigeration in terms of its business model is more applicable to what goes on in engineered products than anything else. So, it's not as bad as it was. And it's getting better. We would've liked to see it get better in terms of logistics cost to come down. And we're seeing some of that, but we'd like to see that curve get better. We are -- if you look at our working capital number, we have built a bunch of inventory and the reason we built -- partially, the reason we built all that inventory is to get around the intermittent curtailments of production, which really cost us a lot of money. So, our goal here is, we're assuming that production curtailments are going to come down a lot versus 2021 and 2022, and then logistics and supply chain will gradually get better through the year. Those are the underlying assumptions. Mircea Dobre : Okay. But it sounds like you're seeing some of this already. It's not just aspirational hoping for it. Some of this is getting a little bit better. Richard Tobin : No, I mean, we can look at the futures on raw materials and steel and bar and everything else. Those are -- we can buy those inputs at lower prices than we have them in inventory right now. Mircea Dobre : And related to that, my final question here, how do you think about pricing beyond 2022, because obviously, you have raised prices because of raw material inflation? Does that imply that you're going to have to give pricing back in '23 or not? Richard Tobin : That's a good question. And our expectation is we did not re-price our backlog, as it was built to the detriment of our margins, nor will we re-price our backlog the other way as input costs come down. Mircea Dobre : All right, thank you. Richard Tobin : Welcome. Operator : We'll go now to Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just wanted to circle back to the sort of incremental margins you have that 30% or placeholder for the year. From a firm wide standpoint, sounds like understandably that starts out year at the lower end and then builds, but maybe looking at it from a segment standpoints, should we assume that the incremental margins by division sort of tally up reasonably closely with the differing organic growth profile this year? Richard Tobin : Let me answer it, the best I can. I think the businesses that had detrimental margins in as are between in '21 are where we expect proportionally the biggest recovery in '22. We -- so and I think if you go back and look at the granularity, the comments that I mean that long winded explanation, I gave it the beginning, so and then we don't expect for margins to comedown in some of our higher performing businesses. So, the incremental margins there will be at book margin. We don't give out growth rate by business and/or segments, so you're going to have to make some assumptions there, but we give you backlog and everything else and we give you the full-year. So, I think it's safe to say, we expect robust incremental margins where we suffered in the claim one and we expect book conversion on revenue growth in the businesses that did well in '21. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. Brad Cerepak : The only thing I would add to that is that we got to be a little bit. Andrey and Jack could help with this. There's a little bit of effort around the acquisitions impact on conversion. So, when we give a range there, we think about that range, pre those impacts that we've disclosed in the script we had, which was $40 million for the year, depending on how you're doing your calculations that can impact conversion. Richard Tobin : Very good point. Julian Mitchell : Thank you, Brad. And then maybe my second question, just when we were looking at sort of pricing you met, you talked about pricing beyond 2022, but maybe stick with 2023 for now. I suppose it was a two-and-a-half or three-point tailwind to revenue from wide last year, just wondered within that 8% organic sales growth midpoint guide for this year. How much of that roughly is price and a big sort of first-half, second-half difference on that price tailwind? Richard Tobin : Yes. We had a long discussion here, preparing for this call that question was going to come? And I think my answer to that is I'm not going there. You're asking me to predict mix into the future. I think that we have it here. At the end of the day, I just don't think it's meaningful in terms of putting a placeholder out there. The fact of the matter is we've got robust organic revenue growth, a part of that is price. But does it really make a difference if it's two and a quarter percent, or a percent and a half at this juncture? I would argue not and beyond '23, I know that Mig asked the question about pricing in the future. We're not prepared to have that discussion yet. Brad Cerepak : Yes, on the other hand too, our forecast does not assume that we need to get price in the back-half of the year. I mean, we we've been putting price in as you know, and as you track in the quarterly results that we put out, but we're not sitting here saying to hit this forecast, we need to have big price increases in the back-half. That's not in the forecast. And I think that, what that means is we'll be proactive on price when we need to. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Maybe tell us what was the price in maybe the fourth quarter there and apologies if I miss that. Brad Cerepak : Julian, I'm going to send you to the back office to go and deal with that. I mean, we're going to start carving this into pieces here. Julian Mitchell : Fair enough. Thank you. Brad Cerepak : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Richard Tobin : Hi, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So, Rich, maybe I know you guys don't typically give margins by segment; you talked about the climate and sustainability, technology, segment that's seeing significant margin progress this year. Historically you have had that kind of mid teen target out there for the retail part of your business. Just curious like any other color that you can kind of give us on how much progress if you think you'll make in 2022. And then also just unified brands, was that margin diluted to your business, or no that that came out, that's coming out this year too? Richard Tobin : That was margin dilutive to the consolidated business. It was accretive to -- would have been accretive to Q4 I believe. If it was still in, but -- Brad Cerepak : It's a small impact. Richard Tobin : Yes, small impact at the end of the day. Look, I'm -- yes, we expect to hit our margin target for the refrigeration business in 2022. That's embedded in the forecast. And we expect robust growth out of both SWEP and Belvac back in '22, both of which are accretive -- that all of that revenue is accretive to margin. Joe Ritchie : Now, that's great. So, maybe just following on, my follow-on question, just staying in this segment, I mean, the backlog that you're building in the segment is pretty incredible, right? You know, $2.3 billion, like -- I don't think anybody's got any forecasts that are anywhere close to that that type of revenue number in the out years. I'm just like trying to understand how to think about this segment on a multiyear basis from the top line perspective based on what you're building today? A \u2013 Brad Cerepak : Yes. Well, look, on the refrigeration business, conceivably, we're going to get to the point where we'll cap off the growth in traditional door case, and then put all of our muscle behind CO2. CO2 is the part that's inflecting right now, and we'll probably have more color on that once we get into the mid '22 of what we think that can do going forward. Belvac is clearly going to be a story of building the backlog. So, we can just watch that as we progress through the year, and I think we'll do as we go through the year, what we've done in the past and break Belvac backlog away from the segments, so you can see it. And then Swep, look, we've been doing very, very well in Europe on heat pump technology. We expect that technology to be brought to the U.S. And as part of that, that's why we're expanding capacity today in advance of that. So, to the extent that we're deploying the capital means that we expect that business to continue its growth trajectory over time. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you, Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks. Operator : We will take our final question today from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Your line is open. Brett Linzey : Good morning, all. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Brett Linzey : Hey, just wanted to come back to the internal manufacturing inefficiencies that took place in '21. Obviously, just given the environment those, you know, expected, but can you isolate those headwinds versus the raw maths and logistic inflation that you saw? I would imagine there's some non-repeat there, just trying to get a sense as to what that number looks like? Richard Tobin : Yes, it's a meaningful number. It's a large driver of the margin impact on engineered products. And what was the RFP, and I can't remember the name after all of this, and anyway, so -- but sizing it, I mean, maybe we can get back to you, it's meaningful, right? And that's part and parcel to why we think that we can expand profits at an absolute basis in '22, as much as we can, because we took a lot of hits by curtailing production, which really is outside of the price cost dynamic. That's just absolute lost fixed cost absorption and it goes with it. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Well, it's meaningful on the top line and on the earnings line. And I think Andrey can walk through that with you. Brett Linzey : Okay, great. Well, just trying to square the 30% incremental with price cost positive with [indiscernible] it seems like maybe some pushing in the guide. Just back to the e-commerce, looking to double that, I missed the timeframe you said in which you'd like to double those sales. And just given the lower cost to serve, what kind of incremental margin should we be thinking about as you take that number up? Brad Cerepak : We are -- we did a billion in '21, where our goal is to do $2 billion in '22. And as I mentioned before, it's not really cost takeout, it's not the advantage here. The advantage is across the entire complex, meaning inventory management, the ability to do pricing centrally, the ability to do dynamic pricing, SKU management. So, you're just going to have to look at that as a portfolio move, and it's part and parcel to us, extracting synergy across the portfolio through those initiatives rather than trying to parse it by operating company by -- or segment. Brett Linzey : Okay, got it. Thanks a lot. Best of luck. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's fourth quarter and full-year 2021 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director, Investor Relations. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consensual recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. And it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Sir, please begin. Jack Dickens : Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of our call will be available on our website through May 12th and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for three months. Dover prepare -- provides non-GAAP information. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We make -- we assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. I am on slide three, it shows the detailed U.S. GAAP and adjusted quarterly results. So let\u2019s go to slide four and take a look at the performance highlights. Our results in the first quarter were in line with expectations, our expectations. The demand for products and service continue to be robust across the portfolio and the management teams of our operating companies did a solid job of navigating various challenges during the quarter. Going into the quarter, we had appropriately forecasted the supply chain and input inflation headwinds, but we did not forecast significant geopolitical destabilization nor the return of pandemic challenges in China, which negatively impacted some businesses in our portfolio from a demand and supply chain perspective. We were able to largely offset these unexpected headwinds through robust production performance, particularly late in the quarter on the back of our backlog strength. Let\u2019s move to the next slide. Organic revenue was up 9% year-over-year in the quarter on strong demand across the majority of the portfolio. Backlogs remain at record levels up 54% year-over-year and 5% sequentially with book-to-bill above 1 in all five segments. Operating margin performance in the quarter was below our expectation. Planned volume leverage productivity and tight cost controls were able to dampen the forecasted negative impact of supply chain constraints and negative price costs embedded in older backlogs -- in older orders and the backlogs of certain businesses. But our actions were short of fully offsetting unscheduled production interruptions caused by supply chain constraints and severe weather events, which negatively impacted volume and cost absorption and had an unfavorable mix effect on margins. We expect this to be recovered over the balance of the year. During the quarter we continued to invest organically in capacity expansions and productivity initiatives to drive revenue growth and operational success. We recently acquired a unique intellectual property portfolio used in electric powered and hybrid waste collection vehicles, which we plan to showcase a fully electric refuse vehicle built for one of our municipal customers at WasteExpo in May. Our first quarter performance demonstrated again the strength of our diversified portfolio of businesses and our commitment to continuous improvement in operational rigor. Due to the dynamic environment in which we are operating, quarter-to-quarter results will be noisy, which I am sure we will discus at length during the Q&A. But keep in mind that we have a robust backlog and that the businesses that face challenges in the back half of 2021 are positioned to drive robust performance as we get through the tougher comps of the first half of 2022. Despite the macro headwinds, we are well-positioned to deliver our full year revenue guidance of 7% to 9% organic growth and adjusted EPS of $8.45 per share to $8.65 per share. Let\u2019s go to slide five. Engineered Products revenue was up 15% organically in the quarter. Demand continues to be robust across much of the portfolio and we have considerable visibility as a result of backlog -- a robust backlog position. Comparable operating margin was down largely as a result of price cost and supply chain challenges, but sequentially improved, as production performance ramped up and older backlog shipped. We expect this dynamic to continue through the balance of the year. Clean Energy & Fueling was flat organically as the expected roll-off of EMA -- EMV demand in North America retail fueling was offset by growth in other businesses. Demand was strong across the balance of the portfolio of businesses with particular strength in Clean Energy components, vehicle wash, below-ground and fueling components. Let me unpack the margin performance here before we make this an EMV-only story and draw the wrong conclusions of the projected margin trajectory for the balance of the year. As we previewed last quarter, we incurred roughly $20 million in new acquisition related depreciation and amortization in the quarter driven by our Clean Energy acquisitions in late 2021. This represented a 400-basis-point headwind to segment margins in the quarter. The balance of the margin dilution is a result of product mix, which is EMV driven and Q1 supply chain and production challenges. Unfortunately, we lost a week of production in March due to weather event at one of our main production facilities in Texas. Setting aside acquisition accounting, we expect the segment to deliver robust absolute revenue and profits for the full year. Sales in Imaging & ID declined 1% organically as volumes in our core marketing and coding business were constrained by component shortages, as well as China lockdowns and reduction of business in Russia, more than offset growth in our serialization and brand management software businesses. Digital textile printing continued its gradual recovery. Q1 margins in Imaging & ID were down to lower volumes and higher input costs. Pumps & Process Solution posted another strong quarter at 13% organic growth. We saw strong volumes across all businesses and geographies. Demand remained strong in core biopharma activity where drug R&D projects, which that were sidelined during COVID, came back strongly. But we did see normalization in order rates for COVID driven biopharma components as demand for COVID-19 vaccines and therapies moderate. Margin performance was solid in the quarter on strong volumes, fixed cost absorption and favorable mix in pricing. Topline results in Climate & Sustainability Technologies continued to be robust, posting 17% organic growth and strength across all businesses in major geographies. Margins were up in the quarter as robust volumes, solid operating performance and improved price costs offset cost inflation and input shortages. I will pass it on to Brad from here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Going to slide six. On the top is the revenue bridge. FX was a 2% or $43 million headwind to the 9% organic growth, resulting in $0.05 of negative EPS impact in the quarter. Our FX forecast for the remainder of the year does not assume any changes to the prevailing exchange rates, which creates a headwind for the year versus our prior guidance. M&A contributed $53 million to the topline in the quarter, a product of $83 million from acquisitions partially offset by $31 million from the Unified Brands divestiture. We saw a solid organic growth across all geographies with notably strong performance in Asia and the Americas. China which represents approximately half of our business in Asia was up 20% organically in the quarter. Moving to the earnings bridge on slide seven. Adjusted segment EBIT was down $7 million in the quarter and adjusted EBIT margin declined 200 basis points as improved volumes, continued productivity initiatives and strategic pricing were more than offset by input cost inflation, production stoppages, as well as acquisition-related amortization that drove a roughly 100-basis-point headwind. Adjusted net earnings improved by $13 million driven by higher segment EBIT, excluding AD&A and a favorable tax rate. The effective tax rate excluding discreet tax benefits was approximately 21.7% for the quarter, same as the comparable period. Discreet tax benefits were $10 million in the quarter or $4 million higher than in 2021 for approximately $0.03 of year-over-year EPS impact. Now on our cash flow statement on slide eight. Free cash flow declined in the first quarter and was slightly negative driven by working capital investments in inventory and heavy shipments in March, driving higher receivables, as well as higher compensation payments. Capital expenditures for the quarter were principally in support of robust growth expectations across several businesses. Q1 is our season -- is seasonally our lowest cash flow quarter and Q1 last year was a bit of an outlier due to post-COVID recovery. With that, I am going to turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Okay. I am on slide nine. This slide includes our current view of demand outlook, operational environment and margin drivers for the remainder of 2022 by segment [ph]. We expect topline in Engineered Products to remain robust, based on solid backlogs and sustained strong bookings. Vehicle services continues to ship against a record high demand, driven by new vehicle service facility builds, replacement of service equipment, growth in wheel aligners, as well as share gains. Orders for refuse trucks and software solutions are robust, with new order rates pushing well into the second half of the year. Momentum in industrial automation remains strong, particularly in China and within automotive, industrial winches continue to recovery with notable strength in natural resources and energy, and aerospace and defense will remain muted in Q2 on order timing but should accelerate in the second half. As expected, price cost was negative in the first quarter in this segment, but we expect it to flip positive in the second quarter as several rounds of price increases cycle through backlogs. We have also introduced other mechanisms to dampen the impact of margin cost volatility in our Capital Equipment businesses. All-in, we expect margins to improve sequentially as the year progresses. We expect Clean Energy & Fueling to post robust growth for the full year as solid growth in below-ground, fuel transport, vehicle wash and software solutions, coupled with our acquisitions in Clean Energy and components, which are off to a strong start, should more than offset the roll off of EMV demand. Excluding the $45 million of incremental deal-related amortization expenses in 2022, of which approximately $20 million were incurred in Q1, we expect full year margins to improve on volume and mix. Demand conditions in Imaging & ID are expected to remain solid as component shortages in core marketing and coding subside. Serialization and brand protection software should contribute positively to robust bookings and backlog. Digital textile printing is recovering. We expect margin in this segment to be stable. Order trends in Pumps & Process Solutions remained robust for much of the segment. Activity industrial pumps and polymer processing is solid and precision components continues its upward trajectory aided by increasing activity at refineries and petrochemical plants, and a recent uptick in orders for OEM gas compressor new builds. Our biopharma business remains strong, but likely lumpy intra-year from a demand perspective as our customers transition from COVID MNRA vaccine production to alternative therapies. Subject to year-to-year shifts in mix, we expect 30%-plus margin in this segment as the new normal going forward. We expect Climate & Sustainability Technologies to post double-digit organic growth this year driven by its large backlog in sustained order rates. New orders in core food, retail businesses have been healthy across product segments. Our case business within food retail is now booking into 2023. Our heat exchanger businesses positioned well on strong order rates across all geographies and end markets. And Belvac packaging equipment business continues to work through its record backlog. They are also booked for 2022 and are taking orders for 2023. Q2 and Q3 are seasonally strongest quarters for volumes and margins in the segment. We expect margins to improve significantly in 2022 on improved volume leverage, positive price cost dynamics and normalizing sequential. Okay. Here we go. This is the new slide and I am going to attempt to provide some clarity on bookings and backlog by segment, since this subject has been actively debated and I can see it continues to be this morning. First, total backlog is up 50% year-over-year with double-digit growth across all segments despite robust revenue performance in the last 12 months. All segments also posted sequential growth in backlog during Q1. Next, our book-to-bill in Q1 was 1.1, with all five segments above 1 despite 9% organic growth in the quarter. This is a very good picture. Topline visibility is a great thing from an operational and planning perspective, and it\u2019s an important pillar of our full year guidance. Intuitively, we would not expect these elevated order rates and advanced ordering patterns to persist, especially in the short cycle portion of our portfolio, as supply chains improve. But we see two factors influencing current order patterns. First, it\u2019s reasonable to assume that customers who expect persistent inflation will continue advance ordering to lock in favor -- in the attempt of locking favorable pricing. And second, customers expecting robust demand in 2023, while remain cautious on supply chain stability, want to ensure supply. As you can imagine, we spend a lot of time on this topic, and at present, do not have a conclusive view despite booking into 2023 in long cycle CapEx driven portions of the portfolio. So we will just have to adapt accordingly and keep a keen eye on working capital as the year progresses. I would however caution that we need to be careful about drawing definitive conclusions on changes in comparative order rates or backlogs. The scale of our typical operating company gives us significant flexibility to adapt the changes in the demand environment and we manage them all uniquely based on the operating model, business cycle and competitive stack. I am absolutely confident that we have the tools to maximize profitability to the upside scenario and to protect it on the downside as we approved in 2020 and 2021. Dover\u2019s portfolio has significant diversification from a product and end market exposure perspective, many of which we believe has secular growth tailwinds, and as such, despite the ongoing macro and geopolitical challenges at present, we are continuing to invest organically behind areas of strength. Moving to slide 11, again, we are reaffirming full year guidance for the year. And let\u2019s move on to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Hi, Jeff. Brad Cerepak : Hi. Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Hi. Could -- I guess a couple things. I mean, first, Rich, you sound a bit more confident on price cost over the balance of year. You also mentioned kind of older backlog working its way through the system. I would imagine you have a pretty good handle on that, but maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on kind of the residual tension on converting existing backlog and some of these steps you said you took to kind of dampen the volatility on cost inputs going forward? Richard Tobin : Sure. Jeff, I mean, we were chasing price costs last year, and one of the good things that, I mean, the good news is having a high backlog, you get visibility, which is helpful to planning, let\u2019s say. The bad news is if that backlog is building in advance of input cost headwinds, you are chasing it to a certain extent. So, as you are basically -- without replacing backlog, right? You go negative price costs, which we saw in Q4 last year. If you remember what we talked about, at the end of the year, I said, the disappointing performance for us in Q4 was, because of supply chain, we did not convert as much backlog as we would have liked, which would have strangely, our revenue would have been up and our margin would have been down in Q4. And what we have done is we have carried some of that into Q1, and I think, if you remember, what we said about modeling Q1 this year was that it was a safe bet to model it against Q4 of last year, and if you go do the comparisons, we are pretty much spot on. But we are shipping that older backlog, right? So now we had so we are going to squeeze price costs in Q2 significantly and then flip significantly positive, at least in three portions of the portfolio on the back half of the year and particular in Engineered Products, in Clean Energy, and in Climate, where we expect to see a significant benefit in the back half of next year on price cost and because of the comps are significantly easier, right? I call your attention to our Q2 performance last year, I think, was the highest margin that Dover ever posted. So the comp that we have got ahead of us is a tough one. I would tell you that, I guess before somebody asks, again, I would point to Q2 last year as a proxy for performance of Q2 this year. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for that. And maybe just a little bit of kind of macro color for lack of a better term, I guess. But, obviously, the world feels different the last six weeks or eight weeks. I mean the backlogs and orders do look robust. But are you seeing any indication, trepidation from customers about taking backlog or shifting their places in line or anything that would kind of undermine your confidence in kind of the deliverability of the backlog? Richard Tobin : Well, I think that how my top concerns point of view, this China COVID situation is new news in the quarter that we have had to navigate here. I don\u2019t have a view on where this goes. I am hoping, based on the news this morning that we are not going to move on to Guangzhou or somewhere else, but that is not helping from a supply chain point of view. Look, so far, the pricing that we have passed has not been to the detriment of backlog. So we haven\u2019t had call offs in that backlog. I think the biggest issue for us is the supply chain side of the business. Does it get better or does it get worse from here? We will see. And from our customers\u2019 point of view, they again are dealing with supply chain issues and labor availability issues. So that\u2019s where you have got a lot of push and pull of, we are working really hard to get the product out the door and we are working really hard with our customers to make sure they are ready to receive at the same time, because they are dealing with their own call them supply chain issues. So right now we don\u2019t see it. We don\u2019t see much of a risk in terms of shipping our backlog other than our own constraints and so as far as the customer taking it, but we will see going from here. Jeff Sprague : Great. I will leave it there. Thanks for the color. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Hi. Good morning, Rich. Richard Tobin : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : So DPPS, obviously, book-to-bill still positive, orders did turn down on tough comps and it looks like you have lowered your 2022 revenue forecast slightly in that segment and you called biopharma, I think, lumpy. Can you give us some more color on what percentage of DPPS has had? The COVID-related tailwinds and is normalizing versus the rest of the business, and ultimately, how are you thinking about Dover\u2019s overall ability to grow DPPS at this point? Richard Tobin : Yeah. Think that we are going to go through a little bit of an air pocket here in terms of the demand function because of this transition from COVID therapies to non-COVID therapies. I think, on the long run, we believe that this is a growth market and I\u2019d like to thank Danaher for going before us, because I think, they explained it far better than we are going to be able to do it. But we expect in the middle of this year to have reduction in order rates as that transition takes place, that\u2019s accommodated into our earnings forecast for the year. But I don\u2019t believe that this is -- this COVID-related issue is an air pocket where revenues are going to drop never to be seen again. We think it\u2019s an intra-year conversion and we feel really good about our position in single use. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that, Rich. And then could you give us some more color into the improvement you see in DCST, obviously, revenue growth was strong in the quarter. Is it possible at this point to quantify how much added growth your initiatives in that segment are? CO2 systems, Belvac, SWEP, how much do they add to this business and then do you still see that segment hitting your mid-teens margin target for the year? Richard Tobin : The two-year CAGR on Belvac is now in the 40s. The two-year CAGR on heat exchangers is in the 20s. So it\u2019s not -- before we get to refrigeration. So you have got two big principal drivers, which are margin accretive to the segment, by the way. The two-year CAGR on refrigeration business is about 16.5, 17, and it\u2019s widespread across the portfolio, the fastest growing portion being the systems business. As we have discussed before, we will take all the system business we could get and we are trying to maximize the profitability on the case business. Meaning that we are trying to -- we are not running and taking all the business that\u2019s out there. So, so far, so good, still a lot of supply chain issues, because these are complicated assembly processes, but Q2 and Q3 margins should be interesting. Andy Kaplowitz : I guess I will leave it at that. Thanks, Rich. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Steve Tusa : Hi, guys. Good morning. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Can you just -- you said 2Q is going to look a lot like 2Q last year. What\u2019s the organic growth do you think in 2Q, I mean it was a pretty big step-up in 2Q last year, so maybe just over that? Richard Tobin : Yeah. Look, I mean, I think, you can calculate that, right? If I say it\u2019s going to look similar at the end of the day. I don\u2019t have that at the top of my head. I know that from a data point, but I\u2019d have to go ask one of my colleagues here about trying to extrapolate that into organic growth. I can tell you it should be similar to Q1. Steve Tusa : Got it. Okay. Sorry. Trying to do less work these days, looking for a little help there. Richard Tobin : Right. Steve Tusa : And so that means that kind of the back half you are looking at, I don\u2019t know, like, 7% -- 6% to 7%? And if that\u2019s the right number, that would imply, I guess, somewhere in the range of a 45% to 50% incremental for the back half of the year? Richard Tobin : Well, the back half of the year, the incrementals are going be significant, because the comps with all the operational difficulties that we had last year, I mean, we lap all that. Steve Tusa : Right? Richard Tobin : We are shutting down facilities and we had negative absorption. We had reduced volumes, negative absorption, everything else, and the beginnings of negative price costs. So if all things being equal, and the supply chain and the macro doesn\u2019t get worse from here, yeah, I mean our incrementals in the back half of the year, particularly in Engineered Products and in Clean Energy and in Climate should be robust? Brad Cerepak : Yeah. I would add to that, I guess\u2026 Richard Tobin : Yeah. Brad Cerepak : I would add to that, I guess, to say, we will see where the macro goes on commodities. But as we think about the back half and the price material implications, I would say, our forecast now include impacted price. So I think we feel good about that under the scenario that the backlog\u2019s cleaning itself out and we have the price increases in place. So I think that\u2019s good news for the back half. Steve Tusa : Okay. Sorry. One more on that detail, can you remind us how much of those, I recall you guys saying it was kind of a $30 million to $40 million kind of one-time-ish type of costs related to supply chain and then how big do you expect kind of that price cost spread to be in the second half? These -- those two items a little more precision there would be great? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, clearly, it\u2019s going to be that headwind plus. So you mop up all the headwind on a comp basis, plus you get normalized incremental margin on the volume. Steve Tusa : Yeah. How big is that? Can you remind me? Richard Tobin : I never told you. So there\u2019s nothing to remind you there. Steve Tusa : Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate the color. Richard Tobin : All right. Operator : And thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Hi, Scott. Scott Davis : I was hoping you could educate us a little bit or me, I should say, on the biopharma business. When you think of -- I mean, all these biosimilars that are coming out, there\u2019s just a shit ton of them. If I walked into one of those facilities, would it have similar asset intensity to kind of the predecessor product? I mean, I guess, and the question is that, are they more -- just as like the use -- single use? Richard Tobin : Oh, boy. Well, like I tried to say before, we listen to Danaher, because we knew this was coming and I think that what they articulated was far better as -- we are a subcomponent supplier. What I will tell you is that, skid production in biopharma is very much a growth avenue, right? It grew because of COVID. But now these mRNA therapies have got a variety of different therapeutic uses and the chosen technology for production and our understanding is skid, and as such, we are component supplier to that chosen type of production. Scott Davis : Okay. All right. That\u2019s super helpful. And then to back up, the electric garbage truck, is this -- I don\u2019t expect you can share on it? Can you make money making these things, are the specks -- are we a few years off from being able to actually, I am just picturing, the battery density has to be massive to be able to drive these things more than 20 miles. So any color there that you can help just to understand if that\u2019s a real market or not? Richard Tobin : I don\u2019t know. Maybe you and I can go down to WasteExpo on May 5th and go take a look at it. Look, we are not\u2026 Scott Davis : I will take a pass on that, Rich. Richard Tobin : I will meet you there. Scott Davis : Let\u2019s put it that way. Richard Tobin : Yeah. We don\u2019t have a plane here, so I can\u2019t pick you up. Nonetheless\u2026 Scott Davis : Yeah. Richard Tobin : \u2026 remember, we are not a chassis builder. So this is\u2026 Scott Davis : Yeah. Richard Tobin : \u2026 a basically if you think about a hybrid, this is a battery pack that drives the compactor that sits on the back of the truck. So the use is, in theory, a full electric vehicle. So you have a full electric truck with this technology sitting on the back, but you could also have a diesel chassis with an electric -- so with an electric compactor, the guys that run this business are going to hate me for trying to describe it and you get basically a hybrid benefit. So are we going to make money on it? That\u2019s the intent. But the fact of the matter is, for municipalities, its taxpayer money at work here and if somebody decides they want to go to an electric fleet, they are going to go to an electric fleet, and as a material supplier, we have got to have a product offering. Scott Davis : Yeah. Makes sense. All right. Thank you, guys. I will pass it on. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Hi, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey. Rich, just a quick clarification just on the 2Q comment. So we are talking about like-for-like EPS, right, organic growth? It\u2019s going to be up, obviously, so margins down on a year-over-year basis 2Q? Richard Tobin : Yeah. Look, I mean, I know, we have all these discussions about price cost and what\u2019s ignored there is the dilutive effect on price cost. Even at neutrality, it\u2019s dilutive to margins. So you are going to get that piece of it even if we were absolutely neutral across the entire portfolio and pricing has been robust. That\u2019s the math. That\u2019s the way the math works at the end of the day. Now, our portfolio is so diverse. It\u2019s a little bit all over the place and depending on how much commodity exposure we have in certain businesses and everything else. From an absolute profit point of view, I think, because Q2 was peak margins for -- I am going to get my years right now, 2021. Joe Ritchie : That\u2019s right. Richard Tobin : Even with that dilutive effect and absolute profit, Q2 is a proxy. But I\u2019d be careful about the margin. Joe Ritchie : Yeah. No. That makes a ton of sense. I guess the follow on there is really, I want to kind of parse out the Clean Energy & Fueling margin this quarter. So, clearly, we know the AD&A, the 400 basis points. Is -- so I guess two questions. One, are we going to see the rest of the depreciation and amortization come in in Q2? Is that going to be linear throughout the year? And then the second question, just maybe kind of help parse out a little bit more, I think, you guys talked like one week production being down in that business. And so how quickly can kind of see that ex-AD&A, how quickly can margins come back? Richard Tobin : Yeah. I am going to leave the AD&A questions to my colleagues. I will deal with everything else and we can circle back on the linearity. Brad Cerepak : The -- well, I mean, to answer that question, the back half goes to a linear amortization amount at roughly $7 million a quarter. So if you are thinking about the second quarter, it\u2019s not as high as the first, because of the inventory rolls off into the second quarter, and we said it was 45 for the year, so you could do the math and squeeze the second quarter and that\u2019s as simple as I can make it. Richard Tobin : Okay. We will endeavor to remove AD&A from the segments going forward, our bad on that one. Nonetheless, look, Q1 was just a mess. I don\u2019t want to go back and revisit COVID. But in January, at our main production facilities, we weren\u2019t doing much. We rushed like hell to pump out as much as we could and we were actually at a pretty good pace, and then we lost a week of production in our main production facility above-ground dispensers in March because of hurricane. That\u2019s life. It should have happened in the quarter where we weren\u2019t taking $20 million of AD&A I guess. And our Clean Energy business, which no one understood and -- understandably no one understands the seasonality. Their actual lowest profit margin of the year is Q1, where we basically write orders for the balance of the year. So the backlog that we can see and the revenue trajectory that we can see for those business is very good, but is actually dilutive to prior year margins because of seasonality. So, from here, supply -- all things supply chain being equal, our below-ground business, which is very profitable is booked and our Clean Energy is all coming and that\u2019s accretive to margins and that is doing very well from a backlog point of view. So as long as we can get the product out the door, I am confident that full year absolute profit and margins performance will be robust despite EMV. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Super helpful. Thanks. Thank you both. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Good morning. Richard Tobin : Hi. Thanks. Andrew Obin : Well, just a question on volume versus pricing. In Q1, pricing was up 6% and it sounds it\u2019s going to get better. So if we sort of look into second half, if we look at the organic growth guidance with a powered sort of pricing, it implies relatively flat volume in the second half. Given how robust orders and backlog is, just wondering are you guys trying to gauge growth in the second half to optimize profitability, like, given this dynamic between price cost uncertainty to the backlog? Just trying to understand how you think about very robust backlog and volumes seemingly being flattish in the second half? Richard Tobin : Yeah. I think that one could say that pricing that you have seen in Q1 remains linear over the balance of the year and the margin accretion in the second half is, because you flip positive because of inventory valuation, so, if you follow me. Meaning that\u2026 Andrew Obin : Yeah. Richard Tobin : \u2026pricing is in. As we cycle the older inventory that is valued higher, you have got -- in Q4 and Q1 it was dilutive. It gets to neutrality, slightly positive and then it flips all things, assuming we get all the product out the door positive from there. So the growth rate for the full year, one could assume is somewhere in the 5% to 6% price-related and the balance being volume. But as you know, mix here, because of the diversity of the portfolio is going be quite different likely. Andrew Obin : Got you. And then sort of a second question, how -- European growth was surprisingly robust this quarter sequentially, given all the news in Ukraine, how has your view changed on Europe and for the second half? And also maybe broadly, are we banking on North American growth and maybe less Asia and European growth in 2022? So your specific plan be just sort of mix between North America and the rest of the world? Thank you. Richard Tobin : Yeah. I mean, the economic environment in Europe is a risk. But we can only look, the good news is that our backlogs in Europe are not as high as they are in North America, but they still remain good and our expectation is that we would ship off that, but clearly, we are going to watch order rates in Europe from here, if one adopts a scenario of the demand function in Europe getting worse from here. Look, Andrew, I mean, we could think of 100 different reasons to kind of tap down expectations for this year, whether that be, what\u2019s going to happen with COVID in Asia. What\u2019s going to happen with Russia, Ukraine in Europe? We are not assuming continued strength in the dollar versus some of our other trading currencies. But I think that would be a copout and it\u2019s too early to tell here. The good -- we are looking -- the challenge for us is to get the product shipped profitably from here. And that is up to us in the productivity side and it\u2019s up to us to work the supply chain things like crazy. But as I said in my prepared comments, we do this business-by-business and we are on it, right, in terms of tearing apart order rates and making sure that we don\u2019t get over our skis from a working capital perspective or anything else and we will see how it goes. Right now, we believe that we can meet our forecast for the year. Andrew Obin : Well, great. I appreciate that. I also appreciate the bookings [ph] early in the earnings season. Thanks a lot. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to start off with Imaging & ID, as I don\u2019t think that division has been touched on much yet, you took down the sales guide slightly, but had very good order growth actually in Q1 versus other businesses. So maybe help us understand on that revenue outlook, how much is just that soft start to the year on sales. Also, I think, there would be more conversation in your prepared remarks around component shortages in DII than perhaps what we have heard three months to six months ago, so any color around that. And how do we think about the margins kind of flipping around there may be as those shortages ease? Richard Tobin : Well, I will take the last one first. I think that we said that margins are going be stable on the full year. Look, we did have circuit board shortages in Q1, bad on us. And that was partially due by the fact that we sourced those from Asia, so the Asia lockdowns and we had to shut our production factory in Shanghai -- which is in Shanghai during the quarter. So we will pick up as much as we can out of there. To a certain extent, the geographical mix on that business is more levered towards consumer production in Europe. So we are being a bit cautious in the demand function, and, again, I don\u2019t want to bring up this translation issue again, but that\u2019s part of it also. So, overall, I mean, this is a business that grows low-to-mid single digits at pretty much constant margins, although I will give the management team a lot of credit, over the last couple years, they have driven margins up nicely, our expectation for this year, probably that kind of performance, low single-digit growth at healthy margins and excellent cash flow. But it\u2019s going be a little choppy base on macro and supply chain. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then maybe a question on inventories, one more for Brad and one for you, Rich. But, I guess, Dover\u2019s own inventories, you had the big working capital headwind, free cash flow was very soft in Q1. How quickly does that reverse? And then maybe for Rich, what we often hear from a lot of multi-industry companies is their own inventories are sky high, their customer distributed inventories are rock bottom. Maybe help us understand how you see that delta today regarding Dover? Richard Tobin : Okay. You want me to take it first? Brad Cerepak : Go ahead. Sure. Richard Tobin : Yeah. All right. As a portfolio comment, we do not believe that our inventories are reflective of our distribution network inventories. Meaning pretty much what we ship out the door kind of passes through distribution. Our inventories are high, clearly, but so is our backlog, right? So the way that we look at those inventories is. Before -- I am just talking about physical inventory before we get into working capital, that\u2019s something else. But to the extent that we ship that backlog, which we have every intention of doing that those inventories will moderate. And you also need to take into account that inflation has an impact on absolute dollar value of inventories, right? So it\u2019s very nice that everybody\u2019s talking about raising prices and everything else. But that needs to be taken into account when you look at year-over-year change in inventory because the absolute value of that inventory has gone up significantly. Brad Cerepak : And I think the only thing I would add is the sequence of cash flow is more like it\u2019s been in years past, which is fourth quarter being our highest quarter of cash flow and we will progressively pace through the year where we will see free cash flow increase from Q2 into Q4. But, again, I think, as Rich said, we -- and we said in our prepared comments, the balance sheet will have some liquidation to it in the sense of we had very high receivables because of the high shipments in March coming off of a low January. So just time wise, the collection period falls into the second quarter and then you also have inventory which will continue, I think, to come down over the course of the year as we ship across the backlog. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s perfect. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our next question will come from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey. Good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Hi. Josh Pokrzywinski : Rich, do you think you will need any more price this year, I know there\u2019s been some lumpiness in some of the input costs, particularly things like freight over the past 90 days. But maybe like freight surcharge aside, are you guys where you need to be on price? Richard Tobin : Yeah. You should hear the yelling and screaming that goes on about pricing sometimes around here. Josh Pokrzywinski : I listen to the calls, there\u2019s plenty. Richard Tobin : Yeah. I don\u2019t think so. I think that any pricing from here, especially in the capital goods side, is going be surcharge and not absolute price. But we will see. I mean, if you tell me what the trajectory of inflation\u2019s going be over the balance of the year. I mean, that\u2019s one of the watch points. I mean, I think, what good news, bad news on inflation, is the way that we look at it, is inflation looks to be moderating, except the fact that we have got a trillion plus of infrastructure and American Rescue Plan coming our way. And what does that mean? It\u2019s hard to say right now. I think, the good news is, does that -- is that good from the demand point of view in certain business like ours? Yes, it is, right, because it\u2019s where we have got a big portion of our portfolio that\u2019s tied to CapEx. What does that mean from an inflation point of view? All bets are off there. So it\u2019s an interesting dynamic. I don\u2019t, so I guess to answer your question is, I think that we are going to be very selective from here and if it\u2019s commodity price driven, it\u2019s likely to be surcharge based. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Super helpful. And then some nuisance on the margin kind of expectations from here, especially with the traffic light commentary in the slide deck. Relative to where we were coming out of fourth quarter, any change to how you see either the full year or the cadence in DP or DPPS? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, look, that was in, perhaps, DPPS, like, biopharma demand is probably intra-year going to be a bit light. So I think that nobody should fall out of their chairs if order rates go down there some. The balance of that portfolio is actually order rates are picking up quite nicely. Now that\u2019s slightly dilutive to biopharma, but not to the extent where people saying that we are over earning and we are going to go back to historical margins. So I think if you go back and take a look at transcript, I\u2019d say that, 30% plus is the new normal here. So we will be able to absorb it. Where we are looking and I will -- where we are looking for and it should make sense when you go back and take a look at the calendarization of earnings last year, where we are looking for absolute profit performance, 2022 versus 2021 is in Engineered Products, Clean Energy and into the Climate side of the business. We are not looking for a lot of year-over-year incremental profit from the other two segments. There\u2019s going be some, but that\u2019s not going to be the principle driver, because, quite frankly, those two businesses more or less sailed through 2021. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Okay. Thanks. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And thank you. Our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I dropped off for 10 minutes, so I apologize if I am repeating any questions here. But your configuration margins, sorry, the Clean -- I can\u2019t remember the new name of the segment. But best margin since -- 1Q margin since 2013. So, curious maybe you have talked about significant margin expansion this year in that segment. Just wondering, do you think we are going to be in mid-teens zone for the full year? Richard Tobin : Oh! For the segment? Sure. Nigel Coe : Yeah. Okay. And then -- nice quick answer there. And then turning back to the Fuel, and sorry, I should know these by now, shouldn\u2019t I, but the Clean... Richard Tobin : Yeah. Yeah. I know what you are talking about. Go. Nigel Coe : You called out mix as a significant headwind there, and obviously, the weather impact on the production facility. Given the acquisitions of RegO and Acme, I mean, I thought they were low-20s EBITDA margins, Rich. So just wondering, is there any seasonality to those businesses or was the mix impact elsewhere more than offsetting that contribution from those acquisitions? Richard Tobin : Well, you answered the question. Yes, there is seasonality in the acquired businesses. Q1 is actually the lowest margin quarter. So supply chain and COVID issues aside in Q1, the -- what we expect is we rollout of EMV demand in Q2, which is probably the peak for EMV demand for last year, which is margin accretive, but we basically offset that over the balance of the year and then some through the acquired revenue and profits and the fact that our underground business and vehicle wash and everything else start shipping significantly through the year and that\u2019s against a comp in the second half of last year where it was weak. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then maybe just one more, a question we are getting a fair amount, not just for Dover but across the group. U.S. CapEx and just maybe it\u2019s a question for Brad. Are you -- within your CapEx budgets, are you shifting more CapEx into the U.S. relative to elsewhere? Brad Cerepak : No. Not significantly, although CapEx is -- in our growth-oriented businesses, if you think about the ones we are talking about that have the higher growth profiles, that\u2019s where the CapEx is. Nigel Coe : Okay. Operator : And thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day. Richard Tobin : Thanks.",

Speaking today are Rich Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation in prior consent the recording of this call. If you do not read these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Dickens : Thank you, Emma. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through August 11. The replay link of the webcast will be archived for three months. Dover provides non-GAAP information. Reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everybody. Let's start with the performance highlights on Slide three. Our team delivered a strong second quarter performance, which related to record quarterly revenue and sequential year-over-year earnings growth. Consolidated organic revenue growth of 7% in the quarter as our businesses continue to capitalize on strong backlogs and pricing actions continue to take hold. We believe our ability to execute and provide needed capacity in today's challenging environment has led to noteworthy share gains in multiple markets, which is positive for our continued growth. Components shortages and COVID lock downs and China did negatively impact shipping volumes and consequently efficiency and fixed cost absorption and several businesses during the period, despite these difficulties, as well as FX headwinds are absolute segment profit increased year-over-year, and operating margin improved sequentially in the quarter driven by cost controls good volume and meaningfully improving price cost dynamics. Our strong balance sheet provides flexibility for value creating capital allocation initiatives. We're investing in capacity expansions and productivity improvements across many of our operating companies to capitalize on secular revenue growth opportunities, capture market share and drive improvements in operational performance. The recently-announced Malema acquisition will enhance our biopharma business closed on July 1, and we continue our pursuit of attractive bolt on acquisitions. We also repurchased $85 million worth of shares in the second quarter will continue to proactively evaluate capital deployment alternatives through the remainder of the year. Our strong backlog and constructive demand outlook and execution playbook position as well to deliver growth in revenue and earnings amidst an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. We are maintaining our 2022 adjusted full year guidance of $8.45 to $8.65 per share. I'll skip slide four which shows the detailed quarterly results. Let's move on to Slide five to discuss segment performance. Engineered products revenue was up 19% organically in the quarter on broad base strength across the portfolio in major geographies as well as pricing actions. Margins were up 130 basis points sequentially, and we expect the trend to continue through the second half as price cost spread continues to roll forward. Clean Energy and Fueling volumes are driven by strength in Clean Energy components vehicle wash, and below-ground fueling components offset by the expected roll off of EMV related demand in North America, which peaked in the comparable quarter last year. Margins in the quarter were down year-over-year on lower volumes and constrained inputs and to a certain extent mix. The sequential margin improvement was significant, however, at 410 basis points versus last quarter driven by improving cost dynamics and product mix. In Imaging & ID volumes and our core marketing and coding business were constrained by electronics and other input shortages as well as COVID lock downs in China is offset growth in our serialization of brand management software businesses. FX is a material negative headwind to absolute revenue profits in the segment, given its large base of international revenue. Q2 margins and Imaging & ID were impacted by lower volumes and production stoppages in Asia, but improved sequentially. The team has done a good job in cost containment and finding alternative suppliers to alleviate supply chain constraints and we are confident about good margin conversion in the second half. Pumps and Process Solutions posted a 7% organic growth -- strong double digit growth in our core non-COVID biopharma business, as well as robust growth in medical and thermal connectors, industrial pumps polymer processing and precision components.  Operating margin in the quarter remains robust at 31% plus despite a mix shift towards industrial components. Top line and alignment and sustainability technologies continue to be strong, posting 11% organic growth on solid volume in heat exchangers and beverage can making as well as pricing across all businesses. Volumes and food retail were constrained by supply chain challenges which negatively impact cost efficiency and will result in shipments pushing out into Q4. Comparable and sequential margins were up in the quarter on better mix and price costs, though partially offset by production, efficiencies, and input shortages. As you can see we're marching towards our mid-teens operating margin target in this segment. I'll pass it on to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide six. The top bridge shows our organic revenue growth of 7% driven by increases in three of our five segments. FX was substantial at 4% or $74 million headwind to our revenue growth and is and also to our profitability, resulting in $0.08 negative EPS in the quarter. We expect FX to remain a headwind for the year compared to our prior expectations. In all changes in foreign currency translations from April until today are estimated to have a full year 2022 impact of an incremental $0.10. M&A contributed $49 million to the top line in the quarter a product of $84 million from acquisitions partially offset by $34 million from unified brands divestiture. We saw organic growth across the U.S. and Europe, Asia was flat organically in the quarter as China was down 4% driven principally by COVID lockdowns, offset by growth in other parts of the region. Our businesses in China have resumed operations and we are currently seeing recovery in production and regionally sourced components. On the bottom of the chart, bookings were down year-over-year primarily due to foreign exchange, and a one-off $74 million debooking in beverage can making due to customer financing limitations. Likewise, our backlog was negatively impacted by the aforementioned debooking, as well as a negative impact from FX. Let's go to the earnings bridges on Slide seven. Before I get into the charts, I want to remind everyone we now exclude the impact of acquisition amortization accounting from our segment earnings, which avoids a deal related noise quarter-to-quarter and better aligns the basis of our segment earnings presentation with our consolidated adjusted EPS. This change had no impact to our GAAP earnings or adjusted EPS. Now to the charts. Segment earnings were up $9 million in the quarter, on improved volumes and price costs, though partially offset by supply chain constraints and foreign exchange headwinds. Segment margins were down 80 basis points. Adjusted net earnings improved by $10 million driven by higher segment earnings and favorable corporate expenses partially offset by higher taxes. The effective tax rate excluding discrete tax benefits was approximately 21.5% for the quarter comparable to the prior year period. Discrete tax benefits were lower than the prior year at $4 million in the quarter or approximately $0.03 of EPS. This compares to discrete tax benefits of $0.08 in the second quarter of 2021. We expect our back half tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%. Our cash flow statement is on slide eight. Free cash flow declined in the first half of the year driven by working capital investments in inventory necessitated by the high backlog. Supply chain constraints exacerbated by input shortages preventing completion of some work in process inventory in the quarter, as well as higher receivable balances on growing sales. The quarter also included $43 million tax payment related to the sale of Unified Brands. Capital expenditures were up year-over-year and are principally in support of our robust growth expectations across several businesses. Free cash flow was 6% of revenue in the quarter and would have been 8% excluding the UB tax payment. We expect cash conversion to improve in the second half of the year more in line with typical cash conversion seasonality in our businesses, driven by earnings, conversion and inventory reductions. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Right. Thanks Brad. Let's go to Slide nine. This slide is our current view of the demand outlook operational environment and margin drivers for the remainder of 2022 by segments. We expect top line and engineer products to remain robust based on elevated backlogs and implemented price increases. Vehicle services continues to see a constructive demand environment across all geographies with particular strength in North America. Demand for refuse collection vehicles and parts remains very strong, and our connected collections digital businesses significantly outperforming expectations. Our backlog includes fully implemented price actions that support the projected recovery and margins we expect volume productivity and improved price cost spread to be positive drivers of earnings accretion and margin improvement in the second half of the year. Clean Energy and fueling, we expect to see robust growth in the second half of the year after a roughly flat first half. We continue to see solid demand in North America for below-ground retail fueling, fuel transport vehicle wash and software solutions. Our acquisitions and clean energy components continue to outperform their year 1 acquisition models, and we have already begun to deploy capital in these businesses to expand capacity and improve productivity. We expect margin performance to improve in the second half on stronger volumes and mix, which will drive improved full year margins in this segment. We expect volumes in Imaging & ID to improve as component shortages is with China recovering from second quarter COVID shutdowns. We continue to work to identify alternative electronics providers to alleviate component bottlenecks going forward and we're beginning to see some inquiries and approve order rates for large scale printers and digital textile printing at positive development and industry that has experienced a prolonged recovery. We expect margin to improve in the second half and better volume and cost containment while keeping a close eye on FX. In Pumps & Process Solutions activity industrial pumps remain, solid polymer processing has booked several big projects to lay the foundation for a very strong second half. And we recently received our single largest order ever for the business in early July. Precision Components continues its upward trajectory in both bearings and compressor components across all geographies as investments in energy sector pickup. We expect the current below normal demand trend and biopharma to continue for the balance of the year as biopharma manufacturers finished transitioning their R&D pipelines and production systems from COVID related businesses to other growing biologic therapies. We expect Climate & Sustainability Technologies to post double-digit organic growth this year driven by its large backlog and pricing initiatives. Demand remains robust across all lines in food retail, while input shortages have hampered food retail shipments they are expected to improve, resulting in a catch up of deferred shipments into the second half of the year. Our heat exchanger businesses positioned well in strong order rates across all geographies and end markets, in particular, in the European heat pump business. In Belvac beverage packing equipment business continues to work through its record backlog. We have already been awarded new projects in Q3 to materially offset the deep working in Q2. We expect margins to improve year-over-year on volume leverage and positive price cost dynamics and normalizing supply chains. Let's go to Slide 10. I presented this slide at a recent conference, but it bears repeating, as not everyone attended the event and the topic continues to be actively debated. There is a view that booking rates of the sole predictor of demand and revenue growth and negative year-over-year bookings on top of a record 2021 are somehow spelling trouble. None of us know what the future holds, especially in the current environment, let's level set on the basics here. First, if you look at our revenue and bookings, they've historically been correlated. But because of demand wave coming out of the pandemic, coupled with extended lead times from supply chain issues and some change in product mix, our bookings jumped in 2021 to $9.4 billion, well ahead of our revenue last year and our guide for 2022 revenue. That resulted in backlogs that are at record highs, roughly double where they have normally been on a 12 months revenue basis. That, over time, should come down, which is healthy because it means we lead times are coming out and global supply chains are improving. Our backlog is sufficient to feed revenue growth for a significant period. And it's worth noting that our backlogs midway through the year are still higher than they were at the beginning of the year. And despite a decline in bookings our book-to-bill ratio so far this year is still above one and in line with historical trends. Our current booking and backlog trends should position us to enter 2023 on solid footing. Let's move to slide 11. And we show historical first half versus the second half margin performance. Historically, Dover has generated higher margins in the second half of the year. Last year was an anomaly as input inflation and supply chain constraints and COVID shutdowns hit the second half. Our sequential margin trajectory is upward and progressing largely as expected, and we remain confident that about the positive second half margin dynamics in line with historical seasonality, although I would note that Q4 will contribute more to absolute profits than normal on backlog and order timing and as we liquidate a large work in progress balances in inventory. Make no mistake; we remain concerned with the inflation trajectory and general macro backdrop and the different demand scenarios that are possible in 2023. We have a playbook to act decisively to adapt both from a cost structure and working capital perspective of the different demand conditions. But sitting here today, looking at our backlog, significant portions of our portfolio were sold out for 2022. So we would expect the order rates to inflect positively as we go into the second half. We have levers that are not demand dependent. We have positive contributions from our organic capital deployment and productivity initiatives in our four enterprise pillar efforts will positively contribute to next year's earnings. We also have very interesting and underappreciated portions of our portfolio where secular demand growth will outperform the broader industrial market. In closing, I'd like to thank my colleagues around the globe for their continued dedication to strong performance in a demanding operating environment. And Jack, I'll hand it back to you, and we can get to the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys good morning. Just you mentioned FX impact in the quarter $0.08, what was it versus expectations? And what is the new guide assume for FX impact on EPS basis versus the previous guide? Brad Cerepak : Well, okay, I'll take that. Within the quarter, the impact was about $0.02 of our -- against our expectations. I said for the full year, from here forward, it would be about $0.10. And I think you're asking me specifically what kind of forecast rate are we using. I could say we're using a euro of about $1.05. Today, it's trading at about $1.02. So maybe the headwind is a little bit higher. But we'll see. We'll see what happens now going forward, especially with the ECB raising rates. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just another question on commodities. Commodity is broadly down from their peak. So how should we think about -- you definitely highlighted that supply chain is getting better into the second half. But how should we think about that flowing into Dover cogs? Is it a 6-month lag? Is it a 12-month lag? Richard Tobin : On the commodity side, we get the majority of it in the second half, right? So all of that has been in inventory for some period of time of what we've been waiting for is the pricing to roll forward. So we've seen a significant improvement in Q2. And the expectation is on the backlog. The raw materials being fully priced in the back half of the year and those businesses that are exposed to raw materials, and that's why we're confident about the margin accretion potential. Andrew Obin : And is there any sort of incremental margin just as FX create some incremental headwinds? Is there an incremental margin of safety from commodity decline, as we think about towards exiting the year? Richard Tobin : That's too complicated for me, Andrew. Over the last, what, couple of weeks, we've watched a significant devaluation of the euro against the dollar and we were modeling if that pace was to continue. it's pretty drastic. So as Brad mentioned, I think there's been some recovery and some noise out of the ECB about raising interest rates, buffering that impact. But it's -- we're going to have to see. And remember, too, that we're going to convert at average rates. So you got to be careful about taking spot rates and then trying to run the mass on the second half of the year. Brad Cerepak : But I would just add that as it relates to price commodities. I feel good about the fact that all of our price actions are enacted going into this back half. And so we'll see what happens with commodities. I mean that's basically all we can say is, we'll see. Andrew Obin : Rich, Brad, always a pleasure. Thanks. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hello Rich Tobin and Brady. Richard Tobin : Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey just two from me. First, Rick, just on the Belvac situation. We tend to think of the customers, Coke Pepsi, Crown, Ball, etcetera. So a little surprised to hear if somebody had a financing issue. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on what happened there? And then maybe the backfilling you're talking about is somebody stepping in and taking those slots. Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean the -- look, capacity has been constrained and can-making for three years now, right? And that's what's been driving a lot of the capital investment by the can makers. But what you've also seen is a lot of companies that rather than go into the can makers are vertically integrating. That happened to be a particular project in Eastern Europe, which was a vertical integration play with the blow-up of the equity markets and financing conditions changed. The order got cancelled. But having said that, like I said, subsequent events, we got a $40 million order last week. So we had to debook it. That's life. None of the revenue and earnings for that particular order impact 2022. That was actually a 2023 project. Jeff Sprague : Right. Interesting. And then just on the trajectory for the year here, I mean, clearly what you're saying about price cost and trends would indicate a sequential improvement in Q3 versus Q2, but you also are signaling a little bit more Q4 waiting? Could you just give us a little more color on how you expect the back half to play out here just to make sure we're all properly triangulated? Richard Tobin : Sure. Look, I mean, at the end of the day, this was the quarter where we really had to chin the bar because that was the highest profitability quarter since the demerger or the spin-off that we had to chin the bar to the extent that we chin the bar considering everything was going on. This is the one we're probably most worried about this year, and we chin the bar. So my comment on just the seasonality of the back end of the year, you can see the chart that we put into the presentation. I would just caution that because of this issue about all this work in process that we have, I would expect that to continue through Q3, meaning that we're going to actually pushing a lot more out the door in Q4 than we historically have been. As you know, generally speaking, we would kind of run flat out and then run for cash in Q4 historically. The supply chain issues are not repairing themselves, at least sitting here today at the speed that would allow us to deplete a significant part of our backlog and our WIP in Q3. So it's going to move into Q4, which is all baked into the full year forecast. So it was more of a comment that'll just be not that we give a damn about quarterly results. We're a full year company here. But I think that Q4 will be higher proportionally in terms of earnings than the historical trend. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks a lot. Richard Tobin : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Hey Scott. Scott Davis : Sharp move we saw on FX. I mean, is there a point where there's a demand destruction, challenge is, Is there and perhaps maybe framing how much of your product is kind of moving from dollar based regions to non-dollar based regions and be helpful in that regard? But is there a certain point where you start to get nervous? Richard Tobin : Well, I'm more nervous about the European macro than I am about FX. We don't ship hardly anything from the U.S. into Europe, where we run into problems with Euro dollar of any consequence. It is a bit of a -- and I don't think that there's a significant competitive advantage that we've been taking advantage of, a lower dollar versus the euro over time. So, I don't from a demand point of view, I don't think FX is an issue. I think that European macro is more of an issue. We don't see the effects of it today. But I mean, we're not naive and things aren't great with energy costs, where they are and everything else there. Scott Davis : And how about emerging markets, where perhaps they have to buy in U.S. dollars, the product? Richard Tobin : Again, we do a lot of four regions in region. The products that we ship into emerging markets are most how do I want to put this? I mean there is no Asian competitor for Maag, for example. So we come under some pressure from a pricing point of view, maybe in the future if we assume that currencies -- the dollar remains strong against emerging market currencies. But right now, I think that between some of the bigger capital goods side, like the Maags and the Belvacs of the world, I think we can weather that. Scott Davis : Okay, and then just quickly last, the printing ID business, any of your consumer goods, customers, delaying orders or talking about, any slowdown demand there? Richard Tobin : No, not really. I mean we just had some operational problems. We in Q2. I mean we are levered from a production point of view to Asia, to China specifically. So we've had some mission. We had to shut our operations down there in Q2 for a period of time during the lockdown. And we are caught up in some of the supply chain on electronics components there that we ended the quarter with a decent improvement there. So I would expect that at least on the on the printer portion of the business will catch up in the second half. We do not see a deterioration on the consumable side. Brad Cerepak : I'd say we lost in that segment about four points of growth, because of the shutdowns in China and the component supplies within that business, which catches up in the back half. Scott Davis : Okay. Thank you, Brad. Thanks, Rich. Take care. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : We'll go next to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Rich, can we start on pricing and the expectation? First for the rest of the year, I think you used up at six points of price this quarter. And then there's a lot of discussion right now around base metal prices are deflating. How are companies -- are companies going to have to give back some pricing as commodities deflate? Can you maybe just provide some context for how that's going to work across your business? Richard Tobin : Yes, it's going to be an interesting dynamic and number one. Price cost, inflects materially positive in the second half, all of our pricing is done for the year. So what -- any pricing action we're taking now is more of a 2023 issue. Raw materials costs are coming down. We are not, we didn't reprice our backlog, into the headwind. And we have no intention of repricing our backlog into the tailwind. And that is something that's been an active dialogue with our customers now for seems like forever. But I guess, the last year if prices have to come down, because raw materials are deflating, that's actually positive to margins. Because, if we look at price cost on a rolling 12-month basis, you basically took a big headwind in the back half of last year into the Q1 of this year, and then you get a tailwind in the balance of the year, end up mostly, at least on the capital goods side, a net neutral over time. It's just you have the spread between the liquidation of the backlog timing. So if it comes down in pricing, yes, it is a headwind to revenue, but it's actually a positive to operating margin. Joe Ritchie : And maybe this kind of following up on the piece of the business, it's not backlog sensitive. So most of most of your business, right, this short cycle piece, would you expect to be this, in a deflationary backdrop, dollar neutral, would you be dollar positive, I\u2019m just trying to trying to get a sense when you get to keep some of it as we kind of progress over the next 12 months. Richard Tobin : Yes, on the short cycle portion of the business, I wouldn't expect that there's not that dynamic of input cost tied to market pricing. I mean, that's really the capital goods portion of the business, both us ourselves and our customers. That is an on-going dialogue, just because of the proportionality of the input costs. And you can see what the diamond is on the raw material side and the short cycle portion of the business. There is not that direct link. So I mean, barring the competitive environment big becoming incredibly aggressive in 2023, I would expect, it's our intention to keep the pricing that we've laid in. Joe Ritchie : Got it. No, that's helpful. If I could just squeeze one more in. Just the fund process margins finally saw some degradation this quarter, you guys have been kind of calling out mix in that business for the last couple of quarters. Is this kind of like the right new level, this like 31% type margin? Do you expect further degradation in the coming quarters? Richard Tobin : Yes. Look, I mean, let's not get into quarter-to-quarter performance. I think that we've been clear over the last 18 months or so, that 30% margin is pretty much the new normal. There'll be some volatility quarter by quarter, clearly, based on mix. And it's not all bad at the end of the day. I think on the biopharma side, the demand as our customers convert is going to be slow, as I said, in the second half of the year. We believe in terms of our ability to retain our share of that marketplace is absolutely solid we're speced [ph] in and a significant amount of our customer base. So it's just as biopharma transitions. And remember, too, there's other portions of that business that are dilutive to that margin. So when we post organic growth number, I believe it was 7% more or less in DPS for the quarter. A lot of that growth was from the industrial component side, which is dilutive to that margin. We don't try to manage segment margin. Basically, we're pushing all these companies as much as we can. So if we have dilutive mix, that's not necessarily a bad thing. We want every piece of that segment to grow over time. And we're actually quite pleased with the performance of Maag. As I mentioned, that is its backlog is going up well into '23 now and the turnaround that we're seeing in Precision Components, which is levered to the energy sector. Joe Ritchie : Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Operator : We'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys, good morning. Just to be clear, on kind of these price cost questions, I think, I think Andrew was trying to ask about when you guys would see deflation, given where commodity prices are today, I interpret your answer as it's not like you're seeing it in the second half, that's more price catching up with the inflation. So at what point would you see lower steel, lower copper, run through your revenue line item? Six months, nine months, 12 months? Like what's the timing on that? Just to be clear on that answer? Richard Tobin : Sure. I guess now we're going to go operating company by operating. I'll give you two examples. I mean, I think in [Indiscernible] because that has got an inflator deflator that probably rolls every 90 days or quarterly, you would begin to see that a little earlier. Its net neutral, in [Indiscernible] in terms of its operating margin, or its performance. And the other capital goods sides specifically on ESG, we wouldn't see that until mid-next year, probably based on backlogs. Steve Tusa : Right. So kind of blended for the cap goods businesses, 6 months? Richard Tobin : Yes. Steve Tusa : Okay. Yes. So beginning to give next year. So you're not seeing that in this year as a point and that's mostly price catching, right? Richard Tobin : I think it's completely manageable. I mean the -- the issue is going to be what happens to the competitive environment going into 2023, and we'll see there depending on what demand looks like. For us, I like where we stand in terms of our competitive stacks, right? The vast majority of our business have very few global competitors, and I don't expect to see if demand comes down, then you've got some significant headwinds in terms of the pricing environment from a competitive point of view outside of what's happening in raw materials. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then just a question on orders. Your reported orders, including that the backlog, the cancellation. So are you saying that those orders next in the third and -- or just the run rate for the second half that those will actually be up sequentially because of that impact of the $75 million or whatever it is or maybe you can just follow on what sequential orders. Richard Tobin : What I can tell you is that the bar that we had to chin for margin and operating profit and order volume was Q2, right? So we've been guiding for a year now that this can't go on forever and orders are going to come down. But if you noticed, I'm sure you did, that our backlog didn't deplete at all. And I think what Brad was trying to call out; you got to be really careful going forward here because FX has an impact not only on revenue and profit translation, but on balance sheets also. So -- and Roland over to take care of that over time. Again, I'm not worried about our orders. I mean we've got a significant portion of our portfolio that's sold out for the year. Steve Tusa : Right. So can book-to-bill be above 1 on a reported basis for the next couple of quarters? Richard Tobin : Can it be? Yes. Steve Tusa : Okay. Is that in your forecast? Anything can happen here. Richard Tobin : Perfectly frank, I don't -- we don't measure projected book-to-bill, right? We've got revenue forecast and earnings forecast, but no one is running around trying to count orders into the future. Steve Tusa : Except us. Richard Tobin : Yes. Well, we had a discussion around here about book-to-bill orders and backlog, whether that's too much is too much. But at the end of the day, look, this notion that order rates coming down is somehow a precursor of 2023 demand. I think I'd be very careful about that. Steve Tusa : Okay, thanks. Richard Tobin : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi Group. Andrew Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Rich, maybe just to follow up on that. Can you give us a little more color into the puts and takes of your revenue guidance for the year? I know we just talked about currency and length, but you actually raised your organic growth guide for the year despite lowering expectations a little bit in DII and DPS. Does your higher organic growth forecast come from more momentum in specific businesses, DP, DCF? Or is it more confidence in supply chain easing? Richard Tobin : Well, let's see. Number one, the back half is actually an easier comp. I repeat myself again, Q2 was the comp that we had to chin and we actually grew over Q2. So if you take -- if you look at the growth that we posted for Q2, which was the highest bar that we had to chin. If you take a look at what happened in the second half of last year, right, in terms of absolute growth, we're in pretty good shape there. Brad went through what our estimates are on FX, and we're going to be like everybody else, we're just going to have to watch that as it progresses through the year. And look, if you take a look at our cash flow, which is negatively impacted by largely inventory, we've got a significant amount of not so much finished goods, but a lot of raw materials and whip. And our intention is to convert a significant portion of that, which means selling it at the end of the day, again, our backlog which is -- which drives the top line, and we are going to run like crazy between now and the end of the year to liquidate that inventory position, which should be really good for the cash flow going forward. I mean, the 1 watch point is going to be how much we ship in December and whether that gets hung up in receivables or not. But you know what, that's relevant, quite frankly, it's a timing difference. We're looking at the 1 that we're driving at the most is we've got to clear that whip out of inventory, which would have the knock on effect of clearing the raw material position that we have. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then, Rich, or Brad, maybe I can follow up on the cash flow. Obviously, you had your initial cash flow guide out there, 13% to 15% of sales. I know cash flow improved sequentially. But as you were just talking about, Rich, seems pretty back-end loaded. Any update on sort of that original guidance or how to think about cash flow conversion over the next couple of quarters? Richard Tobin : I look at -- Andy, it's basically what I said, right? There's nothing changed here about the cash flow dynamic. Our earnings are going up for the year. That's a positive. We have brought in more inventory because of all these supply chain issues. I'm not worried about it because our inventory position proportionately against the backlog that we have is fine. We're going to watch a significant portion of the inventory in the second half of the year. What happens in payables and receivables based on timing and everything else. I think the only watch point would be on the receivables balance at the end of the year, but then the world doesn't end on January 31, I'm not calling out that we've got an issue with the guidance, and we're going to drive towards making it. But look, I think from a cash flow point of view, we're in no different position than we've been in the past and our earnings are higher. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate it Rich. Richard Tobin : You\u2019re welcome, Andy. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski, Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey good morning guys. Rich, you mentioned there, I apologize I jumped on the call a couple of minutes late. Watching Europe maybe a little bit more closely than kind of worrying about macro at large. Anything in terms of progression through the quarter order rates, mix of business? I know there's a couple of particularly economically sense of the businesses there. I would think the retail fueling when you $8 a gallon gas maybe isn't feeling awesome. But anything there that you guys you feel a need to point out? Richard Tobin : No, nothing. It was just a comment on a watch item where I think the question was more, are we more worried about FX. FX is what it is at the end of the day. I don't think it changes the dynamic where we think it's a headwind of our ability to compete in the Euro zone because of some -- we're shipping dollarized products into Europe, we don't. Clearly, Europe, from a macro point of view, is a watch item. We're not naive here. We don't see it yet, but we're paying very close attention to it. And then we run a variety of scenarios depending on what we think could happen to demand, what we do to our cost structure. And that was the comments I made in the presentation of we've got a playbook here that says when things start moving, how quickly we can move and we believe that we can move faster to the macro balls. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess maybe some out a little bit more strategically. You've been talking about near-shoring or kind of broader supply chain investment by the industrial world for a while now. At the same time, you're seeing some of that, I guess, start to improve. Anything that you think with improvement people sort of forget about or move on from? How are you guys thinking about this transition maybe from like triage mode to how you want to address some of the supply chain issues on a longer-term basis? Richard Tobin : Yes. Look, I mean we've been the recipient, unfortunately, in the first half of the year of our own suppliers going through that transition, which has led to some of the headwinds that we've seen. So I think from a longer-term perspective, it's healthy. So you see quite a bit of capital investment going in let's call into NAFTA for lack of a better word, but that's -- these are industrial products, and they're not easy to move around, and we're all kind of going through that transition. Interestingly, from a CapEx point of view, our CapEx-related businesses are very strong. So the order rates that we're seeing in Belvac and Maag and what's going on in Precision Components and what's going on in Refrigeration. Those are all, let's call them, CapEx-related businesses. And from a backlog perspective and a demand perspective, I mean, they're all sold out for the balance of the year, and we're actually booking into 2023. So I know there's a big debate going on out there between consumer recession versus industrial recession. The CapEx sitting here today, I think that we're more positive than negative in terms of CapEx demand or CapEx-related demand going into 2023. Josh Pokrzywinski : Makes sense to me. Thanks. Richard Tobin : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Deane Dray : Maybe we'll just stay on that same CapEx theme. Any change in your thoughts regarding CapEx spending expectations for the year for you guys? Richard Tobin : Our own, no. No. I think that what we have modeled in for ourselves through the year is we're all done. So I mean I don't think we could we can't spend what we've got in the plan now. So no, I don't think barring a customer showing up and saying, I want X, which clearly we would invest behind right now, I think that we're done in terms of commitments we and you'll see it reflected in the cash flow as we go through the balance of the year. Deane Dray : Got it. And in reference to the early discussion about counting orders, can you talk a bit more about that single largest order. You said it was in pump in process, what the application is, how competitive and how might the margins shake out versus the segment normalized average? Richard Tobin : It's polymer processing where the order came from. It's in Asia and it's slightly dilutive to the consolidated margin but still very good margin. Deane Dray : Got it. And how competitive was that? Richard Tobin : It's -- they're all competitive. Having said that, it's better to be competing with against two other people versus 10 people. And by and large, the vast majority of the portfolio is competing against two or three people. So it's competitive, but not crazy. Deane Dray : That's helpful. And just last one, if I could. Last quarter, when we talked about pricing, Rich you said you might be pressing more along the lines of surcharges? And how has that played out? Richard Tobin : What, I don't -- I think that because of the dynamics of raw materials, we haven't had to do surcharges since then. I think it was an option that we were -- we are basically -- I think that when we had the discussion last time as we've done a significant a lot of pricing here. That's all modeled in the roll forward for the balance of the year. So kind of like our pricing was done, assuming what we have in our EPS forecast. And that I think the response to the question is, well, what if we see input costs go up again, what are you going to do. And the answer was, at this juncture, we'd probably take a look at doing surcharging. We've done some but very little. Because of the fact that we haven't seen a degradation, we actually it's more of a tailwind going forward input cost than it's been a headwind over the past year. Deane Dray : That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Richard Tobin : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Hey good morning all. Richard Tobin : Good morning, Brett. Brett Linzey : I wanted to come back to capital deployment. You made a comment about proactively evaluating other various alternatives. Could you just put a finer point on that? Is it buybacks, special dividend? What's all under consideration? And then if it is the buyback, would you consider levering up or was this just a balance between bolt-on buyback and free cash flow? Richard Tobin : I think that the capital markets would have to get pretty green before we levered up to do it. So it was more on deployable cash flow, meaning that if we were -- if our pipeline from an inorganic point of view was low that we would not sit on our projected cash flow balances for a prolonged period of time. And so then we have optionality for capital return to shareholders. Our bias there is share repurchase over doing a special dividend as we sit here today. But that's always a discussion with the Board of Directors. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. And then just shifting to the European pump business there. How large is that on a run rate basis currently and I know the order rates have been pretty good there. But can you just speak to the scope of further opportunity in that business, and then specifically, how Dover is competitively positioned for the opportunity? Richard Tobin : Yes, we don't really get into giving out revenues by segment because that's a slippery slope that these conference calls the last thousand years. It's a good -- it's material to the full year revenue. I think the reason that we called it out was the scale of the particular purchase order as a proxy for kind of CapEx demand going forward. So it's a good order proportional to the revenue. That business is sold out for the year. So it's all 2023 that we're booking for now. So it's a precursor for the solidity of that particular business' revenue stream going into 2023. Brett Linzey : Got it. Thanks, I\u2019ll pass it along. Richard Tobin : All right. Thanks. Operator : Our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just I thought it would be useful to go back to the guide, maybe Brad, this is for you. So $0.10 from FX headwinds at current plan rates. It sounds like that's offset by a point better organic growth. Is there anything else in the plan that's moving around seems like taxes coming in a bit better. But anything on corporate, etcetera, that we should bear in mind? Brad Cerepak : No, I don't think so. I think corporate was a little bit favorable in the quarter for reasons of booking accrual rates and things of that nature, but corporate kind of gets back to a normal pace in the back half of the year. As I said, the headwinds is $0.10 versus our last expectation. That's built into our guide, same as it is on the revenue side. So revenue and earnings are reflective of what we said was our current thinking about FX rates. The organic increase, another way to think about that is we chin the bar in Q2. We had a good Q2. We see that helps us for the full year as well and solidifying price is also helpful. So there's no huge movements there. It's more refinement than anything else. Nigel Coe : Okay. Great. That's great. And then, Rich, maybe for you or expansive question on Europe. The sort of the top-down view on Europe is dismal. The micro sort of company data is actually coming in a lot better. It's a little bit surprising. So just wondering what you're seeing on the ground in Europe. And I'm just wondering how concerned you buy prosper gas rationing NG inflation? And are you seeing anything sort of unusual in terms of behavior from customers in Europe right now? Richard Tobin : Nothing unusual. I mean we -- Europe is probably more levered for export than NAFTA is for us. So it's not the proportionality of Europe for Europe is actually lower than it is for NAFTA, which proportionately is very high. So there is a bit of a buffer there. So I mentioned before with Maag having a single biggest order European company that's shipping into Greater Asia, and that business remains strong. Look, it's hard to tell right now. We don't see a lot of negative -- negativity. We don't see any cancellations of orders that we have in backlog in Europe right now. It was just more of a -- when we talk to our customers and we talk to our employees, this isn't good and what's going to happen here. But right now, we don't see anything where things are rolling over. But clearly, we are running scenarios, a variety of them if Europe was to run into in some problems, what are we going to do? And like I mentioned before, I think that we've got a playbook that allows us to protect operating margins under a variety of demand scenarios. And I think we proved that in 2020. We would just run that same playbook back again. But I mean I wish I could be more specific. Right now, everybody is concerned on what's going on in the macro in Europe, but we don't see it rolling to a situation where it's overly negative yet. Nigel Coe : Sounds great. Thanks Rich. Richard Tobin : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question and answer period in Dover's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director of Investor Relations. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please, go ahead, sir. Jack Dickens : Thank you, Gretchen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through November 10, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for three months. Dover provides non-GAAP information, and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : All right. Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the performance highlights on slide three. Dover delivered revenue growth and margin improvement in the third quarter, driven by rigorous execution and improving price/cost dynamics that were offset -- that more than offset the impact of supply chain challenges, inflationary cost pressures and foreign currency translation. Demand remains constructive across most of the portfolio with four out of five segments posting organic growth in the quarter. Backlog at $3.2 billion was up 12% year-over-year and remains approximately double the historical levels relative to revenue, driven by continued strong demand across many end markets. The supply chain challenges that we've endured over the past 18 months continued to improve, which has allowed us to reduce our backlog this quarter through increased production performance. It is our expectation that this trend will continue for the balance of the year as supply chains and lead times normalize. Despite the building macroeconomic uncertainty, we are deploying capital to drive productivity and expand capacity in several businesses that are expected to deliver robust growth on secular tailwinds. We closed on the Malema Engineering acquisition in July, which adds a great technology to our biopharma portfolio, and we are continuing to pursue attractive bolt-on acquisitions. During the quarter, we also announced an accelerated share repurchase program to return $500 million of excess capital to shareholders, while preserving sufficient liquidity for value-creating investments. While current demand conditions are solid, our management posture reflects growing caution with the macroeconomic outlook. As such, for the balance of the year, we'll be proactively reducing output in several businesses to draw down inventory balances and initiating cost-containment measures where appropriate. Our business model is flexible, as our 2020 performance has proven. We firmly believe that ongoing improvements in the supply chain and available production capacity will allow us to match production to meet demand within prevailing lead times in Q1 of 2023. We are adjusting our full year guidance to reflect the negative translation impact of foreign exchange on our revenue and earnings. The estimated full year impact of foreign exchange to EPS is approximately $0.37 per share with notable acceleration during the third quarter as the dollar rallied against most of our trading currencies. Let's skip slide 4 and move on to slide 5. All-in-all, the quarter developed as we expected. The capital goods portions of the portfolio delivered strong top line and margin expansion on the back of strong order books, lower input costs cycling through inventory, as well as pricing actions taking hold. Engineered Products revenue was up 18% organically in the quarter on broad-based strength across the portfolio in major geographies as well as pricing actions. Margins were up 250 basis points year-over-year as our capital investments and productivity begin to show results and our investments in e-commerce platforms drive aftermarket volume. We expect margins to continue their upward trajectory through the balance of the year on solid volumes and improving price/cost dynamics. Clean Energy & Fueling was roughly flat on an organic basis. Revenue performance was up in clean energy components, vehicle wash, fuel transport and below-ground retail fueling, but was offset by lower shipments and order trends in above ground retail fueling, driven by customer construction delays in North America, as well as overall caution among operators in Europe and Asia as a result of the weakening macro environment. Margins in the quarter were flat year-over-year as our clean energy margin mix and decisive cost actions were able to offset the reduced volumes and fixed cost absorption in the above ground dispenser business. During this quarter, we began to take fixed cost reduction actions in our dispenser business that were in part enabled by the global product platform harmonization and complexity reduction work that we've completed in the past 12 months, which enabled us to reduce our European dispenser SKUs offering by over 50%. These actions will continue through the first half of 2023 and will result in meaningfully improved operating margins going forward. In Imaging & Identification, volumes for our marking and coding printers and spare parts recovered well on improving electronics input availability as well as the roll-off of COVID lockdowns in China from the prior quarter. Pricing actions and consumables and service demand were positive contributors in the quarter. FX is a negative headwind to absolute revenue and profits in this segment given its large base of non-US dollar revenue. Q3 margins in Imaging & ID were very strong, improving 230 basis points, driven by pricing actions, product mix richness and improved operational efficiency. Pumps & Process Solutions posted 2% organic growth. We saw solid performance in industrial pumps, medical and thermal connectors, polymer processing and recycling and precision components. As expected, the biopharma components business, which delivered peak revenue in Q3 last year on COVID vaccine demand, declined year-over-year in the quarter as the biopharma industry continues to pivot from COVID vaccines to a growing suite of biologic therapies. Our non-biomedical and thermal connector business has grown 30% year-to-date, driven largely by demand in data center and electrical vehicle charger cooling applications. On the back of this demand and forecasted demand, we are finalizing the commissioning of a new assembly plant in the Minneapolis area in Q4. Operating margin in the quarter remained robust at approximately 30% despite a larger proportion of revenues from industrial products and from improved volumes, pricing and efficiency programs across the segment. Top line in Climate & Sustainable Technologies continued to be strong, posting 19% organic growth on solid volume and pricing actions across all businesses and geographies. All three businesses have significant backlogs into 2023. Our capacity expansion programs and CO2 systems and heat exchangers remain on schedule as we continue to invest behind areas of secular growth beyond 2022. Margins were up 500 basis points in the quarter on price and strong volumes, materially improved productivity in food retail as a result of capital deployment projects and product complexity reduction and improved portfolio mix in can-making equipment and spares and heat exchangers. I'll pass it to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6. The top bridge shows our organic revenue growth of 9%, driven by increases in four of our five segments. FX was substantial at 5% or a $97 million headwind to our revenue growth as well as our profitability, resulting in $0.11 of negative EPS impact in the quarter. Changes in foreign currency translation from our last guide in July until today are estimated to have an incremental impact of approximately $0.10 to our full year EPS. M&A contributed $55 million to the top line in the quarter, a product of $89 million from acquisitions, partially offset by $34 million from a divestiture late last year. We saw solid organic growth across our major geographies. The US, our largest market, was up 11% organically in the quarter. Europe was up 9%, and all of Asia was up 13%. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia, posted 8% organic growth this quarter, up from a 4% decline last quarter as our businesses recovered from COVID-driven lockdowns that impacted our ability to produce and sell in the country. On the bottom of the chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to foreign currency translation and improved lead times across several businesses. Our cash flow statement is on Slide 7. Free cash flow through the first three quarters of the year sits at approximately $300 million, down year-over-year on capital expenditures investment, timing of tax payments and performance payments, but mostly on planned investments in working capital. We have been carrying elevated raw materials and components inventory levels throughout the year, reflective of our high backlog levels and input shortages as well as higher receivable balances on growing sales. We are actively working to bring down our inventory through the balance of the year and expect to further liquidate our working capital position with the degree of cash generation also dependent on the timing of collection of receivables. We expect free cash flow generation to significantly improve in the fourth quarter, which is historically our highest cash flow quarter of the year. However, the exact timing of working capital liquidation may take into early 2023. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Okay. Thanks, Brad. Let's move to Slide 8. Let's discuss the battleground items for the balance of 2022 with a brand-new slide, demand trends and backlog. More than a year ago, we were clear that we expected comparable booking metrics to moderate when supply chains start normalizing, and that's the story of the quarter. Bookings were down on a year-to-year basis against a very high comparable quarter, and backlog declined this quarter as a result of improved production performance, which drove the top line. I call your attention to the middle column of the slide. Our backlog remains at historically high levels, about double where it was relative to sales prior to the pandemic. This is driven to a lesser extent now by extended lead times and customer placing post-pandemic orders much further in advance than normal as a result of supply chain and industrial capacity constraints, but more importantly, by strength of fundamental demand of our products and solutions in multiple markets that are indicated with green arrows on the slide. We've talked about secular growth drivers in some of these markets previously, and we continue to see robust near-term trends driving investment in these businesses. Despite strong demand, shipments were held back in the quarter in several businesses, most notably in Engineered Products, due to hydraulic component shortages and chassis availability and in Climate & Sustainability due to subcomponents availability and capacity constraints. We are currently expanding capacity in both CO2 systems in the United States and heat exchangers in four different geographies to meet projected demand. The portions highlighted in orange, we expected to some degree, but above ground fueling weakened in the third quarter as our customers have not been able to overcome short-term construction delays, pushing new builds into 2023. And the biopharma transition from the COVID vaccine production has taken longer than we would expect. We expect both to normalize as we move into 2023 based on inventory drawdowns and reconfirmed CapEx plans. All-in-all, our backlog remains elevated, and we will continue to support the top line. Additionally, our backlogs give us confidence and visibility to plan our production efficiently, and as I mentioned earlier, will allow us to manage our working capital by flexing production performance to quarterly demand. Today, about 70% of our Q4 revenue is already booked, and we have a solid foundation of book business carrying to 2023 that you can see on the slide by segment, highlighting the healthy mix of short and long-cycle elements of the portfolio. Let's go to the bridge on slide 9. Here shows sources of value creation that lead to our forecast double-digit EPS growth this year. We expect to significantly offset much of the $0.37 of FX headwind this year through strong execution and cost controls. We are conducting short-term cost containment measures where appropriate, but more importantly, we are beginning some fundamental cost actions in our Clean Energy & Fueling segment. The 2023 full year EPS accretion from these actions is expected to -- expected at approximately $0.23 per share. We have additional cost actions underway, which we'll update on the Q4 call. Between our current in-flight restructuring activities and the share repurchases completed this year, we expect a solid foundation of EPS carryover benefit into 2023. As we prepare for various macroeconomic scenarios next year, we are confident in our portfolio's ability to outgrow and out-execute in our respective markets. The niche markets that we participate in are attractive and structurally sound from a competitive point of view. Our investments in back-office consolidation, e-commerce platforms and product line complexity reductions are providing us a multiyear runway to further reduce our fixed cost structure and variable costs while enriching the customer experience. Through organic and inorganic growth, we have rescaled Dover since the spin in 2018, which provides us increased optionality for the portfolio decisions as we continue our value creation journey. In closing, I'd like to recognize that we've been pushing our group hard this year, and I want to thank my colleagues around the globe for their continued dedication and strong performance in a demanding operating environment. And with that, Jack, we'll go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : So you took down the total revenue by 1%. I don't know, that's like maybe $0.10 or something like that of headwind, depending on how you convert it. You have some buyback benefit here that's pretty close to that. So what's the other part of the reduction in earnings? Is there anything else that's moving around, or maybe I'm underestimating the impact of revenue. Maybe, you're going to the low end of the range? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, I think we're taking a guess at FX for the balance of the year, and we've been wrong all year. So there's some caution related to that. Look, at the end of the day, we're going to build what we have in our backlog. I think that we are making an adjustment to our posture somewhat in terms of production performance. Look, we've been -- you can see in our working capital balances that we've been running excess inventory all year, because we've been kind of chasing this demand curve. We've been -- we've seen notable differences and improvements on the supply chain across most of the portfolio with some few exceptions during the quarter, which allows us to change our posture of, you know what, let's turn down the production performance machine in Q4 somewhat. Let's liquidate working capital because, you know what, I'm confident that we can restart it in Q1 and push that production performance into next year. So we get the benefit of the reduced working capital this year, and we get the benefit of the production performance in 2023. I think it's the prudent thing to do. I'm not going to make any comments on what we think about 2023 demand yet. We'll wait for next quarter to do that. But clearly, we have some caution in terms of what's going to develop in the marketplace. I fundamentally disagree with what the Fed is doing now. They say that they're data-driven. But if you look at our results themselves, logistics costs, raw material costs have all come down. So the inflation that we had seen over the past 18 months is coming down. But if they are going to continue -- and they believe that they're data-driven. Well, I don't think that we've seen now the impact. We see it in housing now, the impact of increase in rates. So if they're looking for demand destruction, then we have absolutely no other posture than to accommodate that by lowering our inventory balances and moving that production into next year. So I think it's a good news, bad news story. I think we get the working capital and the cash flow this year, which under the trajectory we're on right now, we would have been pushing that working capital liquidation almost exclusively into 2023. We can pull some of that into 2022. Steve Tusa : Right. So basically, it's kind of like a bit of an under-absorption in the fourth quarter as you kind of turn that production down? Richard Tobin : That's correct. Steve Tusa : Said differently? Okay. And then one last one... Richard Tobin : Say any way you want, but that's right. Steve Tusa : What will price/cost end up this year? And if you kind of snap the line on all that, what does it end up looking like so far next year? I'm sure there's some -- pricing was a little bit better than expected this quarter. Maybe there's some carryover of price in the next year as well. Richard Tobin : Yeah. Price/cost, you can see it. We had been saying all year that in the capital goods portion of the portfolio, because of the inventory balances roll forward and because of the exposure on raw materials, that we expect the back half -- and take a look at the performance on both Engineered Products and the refrigeration unit, I mean, those are largely as a result of the dynamics that we discussed on previous calls. We don't see any pushback right now in terms of pricing, but I think that that's going to be reflective of demand we go through. And more importantly, that pricing wasn't there in the first half of this year. So if everything holds firm, we get a pretty good credit from a comp perspective going into the first half of 2023. Steve Tusa : Okay. And that's positive price/cost next year you would expect? Richard Tobin : I expect to have positive price/cost in the first half of next year, assuming that demand is reasonable. Steve Tusa : Yes, okay. Great, thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Rich, could you talk about the cadence of orders you've been seeing? I know you recently talked about some expected weakness in above-ground fueling. You've talked today about biopharma continuing to be a little difficult. But did you see any more signs of slowing in orders toward the end of the quarter here in October? And what are your customers telling you about how they might spend on CapEx going into 2023? Richard Tobin : No. The only place that we've seen it are the areas that we called out specifically in the slide. Other than that, we were not seeing those robust crazy numbers that we were seeing a year-ago this time. But I mean, I think quarter-to-quarter, across the portfolio, while we're less than one, I mean we're at 0.96, it's not like we've seen a dramatic slowdown. But what we're hearing from our customers is two things. Those customers that we're providing products into CapEx are -- by and large, every CapEx project this year that our customers have undertaken have taken too long and have cost too much because of labor availability and total inflation. And so what you see now is as everybody gets more cautious about demand in 2023 that there's almost this view of, you know what, we're going to push some of this demand into 2023. We're going to finish what we got inflight, and then we're going to see where we are. That's the signal we're getting, particularly in the above-ground fueling side. On the biopharma side, I'd just call your attention to every -- all of our customers' results and will tell you that we started reducing product into the channel much earlier. And we provide a consumable product. So I wouldn't take a look at some of the systems manufacturers and say, 'Well, that's a direct proxy.' I think that we are a little bit ahead of the curve in terms of that demand. And as long as those units run, eventually, over time, they're going to consume our products. So we think that this is a margin tailwind moving into 2023. But overall, Andy, at the end of the day, you can't -- as I said to Steve a moment ago, I disagree of what the Fed is doing at this point. There's enough in the system right now that they're going to get what they want. But if they overcorrect, they're going to get demand destruction. So -- and all of our customers are now on pins and needles about that right now. So we can only do one thing, and that is to prepare for a scenario as such. And because we have a flexible operating model, I think that we just get on the front foot and do in Q4 and if we have to catch up in Q1, so be it. Andy Kaplowitz : Rich, that's helpful. And then maybe just focusing on DCST for a second. You mentioned you had good visibility in all three of your businesses. Obviously, there's been some concerns around Belvac. Maybe you can talk about that. And what are you seeing in sort of core retail refrigeration? And you mentioned sort of the expansion in heat exchangers. All that seems to be reflecting in -- improving margin there, too. So how do you think about margin going forward in that business? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, I think that we finally got to where we said we were going to get to. It only took five years, but I think that that's -- I guess we can hang our hat on it... Andy Kaplowitz : Better late than never. Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, I think we would have made it if not for the whole COVID disaster. But nonetheless, look, Belvac -- when you look at that backlog chart, a big chunk of that is Belvac, right? So it's sold well through 2023. At some point, that business is going to have to pivot to more replacement parts, but we look at it as the installed base has increased exponentially. And the margin profile of spares versus built-out units is actually accretive to margins. Goal for refrigeration, demand is still there. We'll have a little bit of a slowdown in deliveries in Q4 just because we went into the Christmas season when everybody stops doing construction projects. But our backlog there remains robust. CO2, we think we've got secular demand behind it. That's why we're expanding capacity. And the heat exchangers, look, I mean, we're expanding capacity in every geographical region. I think we talked about it before. We've been the beneficiary of a significant amount of step-up in volume for a product that goes into heat pumps. And if you look at the major manufacturers, they're all announcing capacity expansions worldwide just because of the technology change. So we feel good about it. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Rich, first, just this comment about portfolio optionality that you closed with, obviously, somewhat of a provocative statement. I know you said it at least one time earlier at a conference. I don't suppose you're going to name names on businesses or anything, but you did throw that out there. So maybe just elaborate on what you want us to think as you lay that on the table and where things might be headed? Richard Tobin : Yeah. It's been a couple of years since we got the portfolio questions. I was missing them, Jeff. So I decided to put recommendation to restart it. Look, I mean, I think that when we used to get questions about the portfolio, part of the answer that we gave was that you can't descale to the amount that we did back in 2018 and then begin talking about portfolio because you run into a scale problem after a while. So if you remember, we spun off Apergy and we had to take some significant cost restructuring to accommodate the fact firm-wide that absorption was going to be an issue. And when we got asked questions again about bigger portfolio moves, part of the answer was, hey, look, there's a lot of value that we can create out of the existing portfolio, which we have, but also to the extent that we can rescale the portfolio, then that opens up an avenue where we don't have to worry so much about that. So that's where we are. If you take a look at where we were in terms of total revenue, pre-Apergy spin and where we're going to close now, where we've rebuilt that scale and that makes a variety of scenarios more possible on top of the fact that the portfolio in totality is worth a lot more than it was back in 2018. Jeff Sprague : All right. Interesting. So the -- maybe just thinking about bracing for something tougher, as you said, maybe the Fed is going to take us off the cliff here. So the preparatory cost actions concentrated right now in Clean Energy & Fueling. Maybe just a little bit of color on how you would further prepare if you think things are going south, other areas of potential restructuring and what leverage you could potentially pull. Richard Tobin : Sure. The Clean Energy & Fueling one is a bit unique. I mean, we did -- we were a little bit surprised in Q3 when the demand went down, because all the signals that we were getting from our customers were -- that there was plenty of projects through the balance of the year. So it basically forced us taking actions that we were planning on doing in January and pulling them into Q3. I mean, we've been preparing for a scenario around the retail fueling business to adapt its position kind of in a post-EMV world, for years now, right? I mean, we spent a significant amount of money in revitalizing the portfolio. At the same time, we spent a significant amount of management time reducing the SKUs, which allows us in the future to make some broader decisions on footprint and a variety of other things. So to a certain extent, part of what we did was in reaction to the demand environment, but it was coming nonetheless. I just think that we had to pull it forward by about three or four months. On the balance of the portfolio, I could only go back to March 2020. I don't see that scenario. But I think that we've proven that if we have significant demand destruction that there are a variety of levers that we can pull, which I don't want to pull. But I think that we -- if you take a look at our performance in 2020 in terms of margin preservation, I think that we did quite well. Jeff Sprague : Great. Maybe just one quick one. The 70% of Q4 in backlog, how does that stack up relative to normal? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, look, if our backlog is double than historic, then it's 50% more. But I mean -- but it's all over the map, depending on whether it's short cycle or long cycle. If you look at that chart, right, printing and ID has got higher backlog, but it's actually quite low relative to its revenue, because that's a consumable business. We don't generally carry any backlog there. So you're going to see a bifurcation between capital goods with longer lead times and bigger build schedules between shorter lead times. They're all up in aggregate, but there's different dynamics between the five of them. Jeff Sprague : Right. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Richard Tobin : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hi guys, good morning. Richard Tobin : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Hey, just a question on backlog. We've been going to a bunch of industry shows, and it seems that some industry participants are adjusting just how they think about backlog structurally. There's a view that going forward, we will probably live with just permanently bigger backlogs, just because there's less visibility, longer lead times. At the same time, it seems that the industry also realized that maybe we've heard from some industry participants sort of protecting themselves in terms of pricing, right? So maybe there are now cancellation penalties. Can you just talk as much as you can about, A, how do you think about just this order and backlog process evolving into 2023? And given the fact that you do now have to probably live with longer backlog, even if you are reducing it, if you've sort of changed the structure of the backlog terms, conditions, pricing, anything like that, big picture? Thanks. Richard Tobin : Well, that's quite the tour de force. Look, there's nothing wrong with having backlog. Given the choice between having it and not having it, I'd rather have it at the end of the day. There are complexities with the issue of backlog, because you're managing pricing of the backlog. And if you recall, we suffered at the beginning of this year where we had a large backlog coming out of 2021 and then ran into cost inflation. And then we had this grand debate whether you could reprice your backlog, which is really a competitive stack issue whether you thought you could get away with it or not and everybody kind of did their thing. I think that backlogs because of kind of the supply chain risk of shortening the supply chain, which I think we've been the beneficiary of, I think that's going to have a little bit of an impact there. So -- but again, I think it's very difficult to compare company to company unless they're pure players because certain businesses are always going to have elevated backlogs in the portfolio. I mentioned Belvac, but Maag would be the same way within our portfolio, where the build time of these products is 90, 120 days. So you've got to get basically the orders -- before you even buy the subcomponents in the raw materials, you need to have the order in place as opposed to marketing Maags, where we don't get all worked up about backlog because it's just consumer volume and being able to price it correctly and make the deliveries on time. So there's a lot to unpack there, Andrew. I mean, I think because of the breadth of our portfolio, we touch it all, all the scenarios. I think that the actions that we're taking now is a little bit of caution of -- you can't look at backlog trends and then project that into 2023, right? I think that we're basically saying supply chain is caught up now. The backlog that we have that we need to deliver in the back half of Q1, we can make it in Q1 so let's not make it in Q4. That's really the pivot that we're making right now. Andrew Obin : Thanks. And just -- I'm sure you're going to love my next question. It's on M&A and with interest rates where they are, high-yield markets are in flux. How have you changed your approach to M&A in terms of cost of capital? And what are you seeing from PE players? Are they restricted? Anybody's willing even to do anything in this market? Just high-level discussion of what the end market -- the M&A market looks like. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Yes. Well, as you would know better than most, price discovery right now is difficult, right? Because what revenue and what demand is going to be in 2023 is anybody's option. And then you've got this whole issue of, boy, I could have sold this thing 18 months ago and got this crazy multiple, and now I can't have it anymore. So you're basically -- you just look at all the big banks. I mean no one's really doing much. Fundamentally, we haven't changed our outlook at all. Sure, we'll make some adjustments to our WACC rates and everything else and the discount rate to reflect current interest rates, but we're not buying things with debt at the end of the day. I mean, I think that that's just muddling. So we're still -- we've got some opportunities in the pipeline that hopefully we can close on in the medium term. So we're still on the front foot, but the price discovery is difficult. Let me just put it that way. Andrew Obin : Thanks so much. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey. Rich, maybe just a higher-level question to start. You guys talked about the capacity expansion. Obviously, the backlog is in good levels today. I'm just curious how you're thinking about that in the context of a potential slowdown in 2023, and ultimately, how you potentially manage to maybe having excess capacity if the demand environment does slow? Richard Tobin : Yes. Well, look, I mean, where we're expanding capacity is where we believe that we've got secular demand, okay? So, when we're -- what we're doing up in Minneapolis -- I mean, I think I referenced it. If you go back and look at the transcript about the growth rate that we've seen there, I think the same thing with the heat exchangers. So, I've got high confidence about where we're fundamentally expanded capacity of what we're doing it for. But having said that, at the same time, we've begun again after taking a time out due to COVID and this big demand ramp that we've seen over the last 18 months, where we can start actioning footprint again. So, arguably, and I haven't -- I can't tell you on a square foot basis, but I'll bet that we're taking out as much fixed cost footprint in 2023 as we're adding. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Okay. That's super helpful. And I guess my follow-on question would be on the pumps and process business. you've been calling out this transition in biopharma pumps now for the last couple of quarters and the fact that you basically just lower up against your toughest comp a year ago. I'm just curious, if we -- do you think we've hit a trough in margins in that business? And maybe you can just talk a little bit more about how much longer you'll continue to see that transition across that piece of your portfolio? Richard Tobin : Yes. Some of the growth that we missed on margins, we were 29.7% versus 30%. God help me. But anyway, look, we think that the segment itself is a 30% full year margin business. You'll get some volatility quarter-by-quarter. We've seen it, right, because of the fact -- but I think that we were trying to say, if you go back and look at what we were saying Q2, Q3 a year ago of -- let's not get all excited. I think that we posted 35%, 36% margins during that time period that we kept saying that 30% was kind of the new normal for the segment itself. I got to tell you, I'm actually very pleased with the margin performance in Q3 because what you can't see is the mix impact of how much biopharma is down, which is down a lot, right, because we've just got capacity meaningfully to let this inventory liquidate. But the margin performance we're getting out of what were sub-20% industrial businesses that make up the balance of the portfolio, we've actually lifted those businesses up. So, if this has happened to us three years ago, the margin compression that we would have seen would have been meaningful. But the fact of the matter is, is that the operators on the industrial side have improved their margin profile significantly, which has allowed us -- we're going to do 30% for the year. So, overall -- we look at this at this point, what we'll take -- if we take another quarter of pain on the biopharma side, so be it. I look at that as a potential margin enhancement now for 2023 as opposed to a headwind. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning guys. Richard Tobin : Hi Scott. Scott Davis : Most of my questions have been answered. But on the FX side, Rich, is it still mostly just a translation issue? And -- or is it -- or have we gotten so extreme now that there's actually some global trade that's being adjusted? Richard Tobin : Look, the vast majority is translation. I'll let Brad step in because if you can imagine with having 18 operating companies, finding out transaction on FX, I don't believe it's meaningful. But he's done\u2026 Brad Cerepak : No. That's correct. It's mostly translation. And as you know, as we talked about in the script, we said the strength of the dollar was so fast in Q3 here that it really changed the dynamics of what we saw and the impacts on top line and on our EPS. And again, it's about $0.10 forecast to forecast, happens to be about $0.10 at the midpoint of our guide, too. So you could look at it that way. There's lots of ways to look at our guide change. But I would tell you, FX and where we're at now and the strength of the dollar, it's significant. And it's been significant all year, but even more so now. I don't think we're unique, though, Scott. I don't think we're unique in that regard. Scott Davis : Likely not. So just to back up a little bit, Rich on the M&A side, you made some comments, but it's -- how wide is the lens, I guess, is a question I want to ask. Is that -- are you -- I mean there's assets available, we're told at least, by folks. And there's not a counterbid by some of the traditional folks out there. People are hunkering down a bit. But is the lens wide enough where you take a stab at maybe something that is a little bit a field of your existing portfolio? Richard Tobin : No. And I guess the question is how long is a piece of string? I mean, I think -- I'll answer your question in two ways. I think it's got to be a business that we believe that we've got a fundamental right to run. We're a manufacturer at the end of the day. So if it's a manufacturing business and the processes on the factory floor are similar to what we do, meaning that we've got a management team that knows how to extract value out of it, it doesn't necessarily have to be in an end market that we participate today. But we are not making any left or right turns into whatever the new area for industrials to go in and chasing thematics. I mean, we're much more blockers than tacklers. We know what we're good at. And we know that we've built a back-office engine now that allows us to extract meaningful synergy costs out of like-minded businesses over time and that's our knitting. But back to the issue about the scale, we've got the ability now to take on something materially larger than we would have undertaken back in 2018 or 2019. Scott Davis : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Good luck guys. Appreciate it. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Joe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. I wanted to revisit base cost and then the cost side of things. And could you talk about the raws piece versus the components piece and timing of when we start to see some of that come in? I would assume that raws just kind of flows through, but I'm not sure what you're seeing from your suppliers and how much pressure you're putting on them to get cost down in a lower raws environment. Brad Cerepak : The raws -- as we talk about raws because we're a purchaser of raw material, you're seeing the benefit now. There was an issue of getting hung up in inventory back in Q2. Now you see the roll-forward in Q3, plus the fact that we priced for it, and we're positive price/cost now on the raw side. On the subcomponents, it's a bit over the map. We don't see on the subcomponents the pricing come down yet because currently, demand exceeds supply. If that was to change, then we would be a lot harder on some of our kind of component suppliers to reflect that in their pricing. So right now, everybody is in a standoff between, well, you want the product, so you're going to pay for the product. We'll see. And we're part of that chain also. So right now, we're getting the benefit of reduced raw material cycling through inventory and the pricing. We're not seeing it on our purchasing of subcomponents yet, but that will be dependent on volume, I guess, as we go forward. Joe O'Dea: Got it. And then on Clean Energy & Fueling and the cost out, just the magnitude of the margin benefit to make sure -- sort of think about the cadence and impact properly. I mean it looks like this is something like a 250 basis point margin lift, something we could be seeing as early as Q4. Maybe just talk about cadence and magnitude on that. And then to the degree you're willing to kind of touch on some of the additional cost out, how the magnitude of that compares to what you're currently sharing? Richard Tobin : You won't see it in Q4 other than the fact that it's buffering the negative fixed cost absorption by taking the production down. So what you'll see -- you can't see it, but what you see in the segment margin, and you see it in Q3, that if we're out taking some of that cost action, then you would have seen a margin compression in the segment. We expect that to remain for Q4, subject to what we do across the portfolio in terms of production performance. And so you have the rollover benefit in the bridge there. And Joe, we're going to do at a Investor Day because we haven't set longer-term margin targets. And I think let's wait until we get to guidance for 2023 and we do that Investor Day, and I think we'll clarify what the upside is because it's a fundamental change to the business model. It's not just cost takeout. Joe O'Dea: Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Hi. Deane Dray : Hey, a couple of clarification questions. I want to go back to Andy's questions. And you've got a decline in bookings. It's modest. But Rich, is there any impact as you improve lead times? We're hearing the customers then don't have to order in advance as much. So -- and also fewer units in their orders. Are you seeing that dynamic playing out? Richard Tobin : Not the fewer units because the lot sizes -- on the components business, a lot sizes are what they are and then the buildup units, we get orders of one. No -- but look, Deane, I mean, at the end of the day, it's natural. Why? With the uncertainty that's out there, this hope that pricing is going to come down and everybody recognizing the supply chain is better, no one's going to order transactional products six months in advance, which I think that when our backlog was going up, we were warning everybody. But despite the fact that everybody wants to write book-to-bills down by 0.5%. And it's healthy in a way. So what our customers are saying is, 'We're going to go back to the more traditional order patterns or not.' We have a lot of discussions with our customers about capacity utilization, and it goes back to a discussion as opposed to, you don't give me your orders, you're not getting the product. And that's where we were for the last 18 months. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just on your European outlook, you're not seeing it in the numbers yet, but are there any contingencies you have in place and maybe even for fuel availability? Just how have you thought that through for the next couple of quarters? Richard Tobin : We are a small manufacturer from a footprint point of view in Europe. So we have exposure to fuel as an input cost, but it's -- I mean, we're not a chemical manufacturer. It's just not the same. But we are cautious about the demand for Europe and have been cautious about the demand in Europe all through the quarter. And so, part of this whole discussion about taking down production performance and liquidating working capital, that's -- part of that is a European phenomenon. Deane Dray : That's helpful. And just last one. Could you just clarify on the pump side and biopharma? How is your mix related to non-COVID? You've had a COVID boost. But if there's less COVID production, vaccine production, et cetera, how is your non-COVID exposure? Richard Tobin : Yes. I'm not going to break it. I think you can send that as a follow-up, and the guys can work with you in clarification. I don't want to go through because, actually, I don't have it at the top of my head. So let me -- let the guys work that up for you, and they'll take you through it. Deane Dray : Sure. Thank you. Richard Tobin : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Hi. Nigel Coe : Hello. Thanks for the details, as always. So, Rich, as we -- you kind of -- obviously, you're talking about some cost reduction selectively across the -- in fueling. You're talking about the Fed. And I think we've tempered that your view about demand disruption. But are you taking any other measures, maybe dab on the brakes on hiring? It sounds like CapEx, you're investing in selective. But what about CapEx? Are you thinking about CapEx down in 2023? I mean, any other measures to prepare for a more uncertain macro? Richard Tobin : Sure. I think the CapEx is going to be down in 2023, and it would have been under any demand scenario. I think that what we've got in the pipe -- what we've done and what we've got in the pipe -- we haven't done the full budget for next year, but I think that, off the top of my head, it was going to be down regardless. So, I think, it's going to be mostly maintenance capital and in-flight that we've already announced, frankly. I'm not aware of anything hanging out there. Yes, on the hiring, yes, let selectively by region and then selectively by business. I think that, we've been doing that progressively during the quarter, for sure. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then, on the inventory, there was a slight build Q-o-Q. I'm not sure if that was mainly inflation impact. But how much inventory do you think you can get out of the system by year-end? I understand you've talked about 1Q 2023 would be -- how much do you think we can get out by year-end? And maybe just -- Brad, if you can just address the production talent that you're expecting for 4Q? Richard Tobin : Okay. I'll take it. I think that, as Brad mentioned in the script, we expect inventory -- we don't have a lot of -- first off, we don't have a ton of finished goods inventory. What we have is WIP and raw materials, right? And that's going to come down. The issue is going to be, depending on the cadence of the revenue, how much is going to get hung up in receivables. So, we've taken production performance down to push hard on inventory because we think that we -- I already discussed why. So, I don't know if Brad is going to monetize it for you. I don't think it's going to be meaningful. But I think you got to be careful about between the size of the inventory drawdown versus the benefit into working capital because of the receivables. Brad Cerepak : Yes, I think -- and that's exactly what we said was it's the timing element to it. What I would say is it's taken a long time to build the inventory. It's going to take some time to take it out, but we're proactive on it. I think fourth quarter is going to look a lot like we've done historically. It is our highest quarter. If you look back in time, you'll find six out of the last seven years with high teens, in some cases, over 20%, free cash flow to revs in the fourth quarter. Our goal is the combination of taking out inventory and liquidating some of the receivables to mirror that. We'll see how well we do. Like I said in the prepared comments, it could take into the could take into the could take into the first part of 2023. Nigel Coe : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : And our last question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe I just wanted to try and circle back on the sort of inventory and cash flow dynamics. So, I just wondered if -- when you look at your customers' inventory levels and maybe the excesses there, do they sort of map and match where you think your excess inventories are as well? And maybe just call out some of the areas when you're looking at the customer or distributor that you sell into, where you think there might be the most sort of pernicious excess inventory. And also when you're thinking about toggling sort of underproduction and the impact on versus your free cash flow, should we assume that next year perhaps we have sub-par cash flow conversion as well just as you try and sort of protect the earnings while bringing down inventory and receivables? Richard Tobin : Well, okay, where to start on that? If we take production down, it's to liquidate inventory, right? So, if we go into next year, hopefully, the inventory comes back because that means that demand is robust. So, -- but we're not going to talk about 2023 demand because nobody knows. Our inventory that we can see is in distribution, and we are not aware of excess inventory in the supply chain. What we can see is OEM inventory. And that's kind of what we saw from biopharma turned down, that there was a lot of excess inventory on the OEM side. But we don't make product -- we don't make finished goods product to be called off. So, our finished goods inventory that we have is for an order. The only thing that we have is raw materials. So, I'm not sitting here being overly concerned that we've got excess raw materials that are not going to get consumed over time. It will get consumed depending on the velocity of the demand. Julian Mitchell : Understood. Thanks. And my follow-up just around the restructuring and the cost-out. So I think your restructuring expense guide for the year is unchanged at $0.17 now. I think it was $0.16 before, and that's probably just the share count guide coming down. But it seems like you're talking up the cost savings from restructuring next year. So I'm just wondering how you're generating those savings if you're not booking the P&L restructuring or not stepping up the booked P&L restructuring expenses. Richard Tobin : No. Julian, I'm not talking about the restructuring expenses. What I'm saying is -- in that chart is benefit. We've given you the EPS benefit of the restructuring within 2022 and the full year benefit of those announced restructurings in 2023. We have got other restructuring projects that we're working on that we will announce in time. The fact of the matter is when we take a restructuring charge, we feel obligated to tell you what the benefit is, and that's on a 12-month benefit going forward next year. It does not include any restructuring that has not been announced. Julian Mitchell : I understand. So the savings next year, we could see some of that reflected in -- or the measures for that in restructuring expenses in 2023 itself? Brad Cerepak : Yes, sure. Richard Tobin : Full year benefit of it, for sure. Brad Cerepak : But some of that is also in 2o22, as Richard said. So it straddles both. Richard Tobin : It's not double counted, I guess, is what we're saying. Brad Cerepak : Yeah, yeah. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s clear. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Welcome. End of Q&A: Operator : Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer period and Dover's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director of Investor Relations. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Dickens : Thank you, Gretchen. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through February 21, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Dover provides non-GAAP information, and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks Jack. Let\u2019s get started with the performance highlights on Slide 3. Dover delivered strong organic revenue growth of 9% and margin improvement of 150 basis points in the fourth quarter. Volume mix, price cost and prior period cost reduction actions all contributed to the positive performance. As we've been forecasting throughout 2021, the relationship between supply chain constraints and bookings has continued to play out into Q4. The majority of the labor and component availability and logistics constraints have dissipated resulting in production lead times returning to pre pandemic levels. Importantly, our 4% annualized through cycle organic bookings growth rate reflects the continued secular demand strength across our businesses. Our order backlog remains elevated compared to normal levels, and provides us with a good topline visibility going into [Indiscernible]. Our continuous efforts to improve productivity and efficiency principally enabled by advances we achieved in e-commerce adoption, back office consolidation and SKU or SKU complexity reduction, resulted in robust margin accretion in the quarter. We expect benefits from our research efforts to further accrue in 2023. We continue to deploy capital toward portfolio improvement, organic growth and production efficiency in 2022. Our capital expenditures in 2022 were the highest in recent Dover history and we continue to invest in manufacturing productivity projects and proactive capacity expansions to fuel our top line growth and margin improvement capabilities. We also completed five attractive bolt-on acquisitions in 2022 that provide exposure to high growth technologies and end markets and finally, we took the opportunity to return capital to our shareholders, including the completion of our 500 million accelerated share repurchase, which was completed in quarter four. We entered 2023 with a constructive stance. Demand trends remain healthy across a portfolio and we have a significant volume of business in backlog entering to the New Year. Expected revenue growth price actions and productivity measures from 2022 lay the foundation for margin accretion in 2023 have high confidence in Dover's end markets, flexible business model and proven execution playbook continuing to deliver earnings growth. Our strategy for robust through cycle shareholder value creation remains unchanged, to combine solid and consistent growth above GDP, strong operational execution generating meaningful margin accretion over time, and value added discipline capital deployment. As a result of this, we are forecasting for -- guided revenue guidance of 3% to 5% Organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $8.85 to $9.05. I'll skip slide 4, and let's move on to Slide 5. Engineered Products revenue was up 16% in the quarter continuing the trend of double-digit top line growth through the year. Revenue growth was broad based across the portfolio of particular strength in North America. Margins continued the sequential build throughout the year finishing -- 20% at 620 basis points year-over-year primarily driven by improving supply chains and price cost dynamics products mix as well as events investments and productivity initiatives. Clean Energy & Fueling finished the quarter and the year roughly flat on organic basis. Revenue performance for the quarter was up and clean energy components. Vehicle wash, fuel transport and below-ground retail fuel, offsetting the comparable declined a dispenser and EMV card readers in the period. Margins in the quarter were up 170 basis points on positive price cost and the mix impact from both organic, inorganic investments that we made in clean energy components and vehicle wash. This was augmented by further cost reduction actions initiatives in the third quarter, and the full, the full year carry over these actions will continue to accrue in 2023. In Imaging & Identification, volumes for our marking and coding printers, spare parts and consumables were strong in all geographies, with the exception of near term softness in China due to the COVID impact. Our software businesses continue to perform well with penetration of key customer brand accounts with strong growth in SaaS portion of our serialization software. FX remained negative headwind to absolute revenue and profits in the segment given its large base of non-US dollar revenue. Q4 margins in Imaging & ID were very strong at 25% improving 250 basis points on stronger volumes, pricing actions and products product mix richness. This business has delivered exemplary margin improvement in the last few year years as it utilizes our productivity tools for e-commerce back office consolidation and offshore engineering. Pumps & Process Solutions was up 4% organically for the year but posted a 4% decline in the fourth quarter driven principally by post-COVID transition in the biopharma space. The non-COVID biopharma business has continued to grow and our overall biopharma business as well above its pre-pandemic level. New orders for biopharma connectors reflected positively in the fourth quarter after several quarters of sequential declines. All other business this segment posted solid organic growth in the fourth quarter with particular strength in polymer processing equipment and precision components in the back of improved conditions in energy markets. Operating margin for the quarter was 29% is comparable revenue mix of products delivered. Top line in Climate & Sustainability technologies continued its double digit growth in the fourth quarter posted 27% organic growth across all business geographies. Demand trends remain particularly robust in heat exchangers and CO2 refrigeration systems driven by the global investments in sustainability. Our capacity expansion programs in both these businesses remain on schedule and will continue to allow us to continue to meet growing customer demand. Margins are up 450 basis points in the quarter and over 300 basis points for the full year on improved productivity in food, retail and strong volume growth and good mix of product delivered. I\u2019ll pass it on to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 6. The top bridge shows our quarterly organic revenue growth of 9% driven by increases in four of our five segments. As expected FX was a substantial headwind at 5% or $94 million and impacted both revenue growth and profitability. FX headwinds resulted in Q4 and full year 2022 negative EPS impacts of $0.10 and $0.35 respectively. Recent euro gains against dollar have reduced our forecasted FX headwinds in 2023, which we currently estimate at $0.05 to $0.10 for the full year EPS. M&A contributed $58 million to the top line in the quarter, a product of $80 million from acquisitions partially offset by $22 million from divestitures late in 2021. We saw a strong organic growth across most of our geographies in the quarter. The U.S. our largest market was up 7% organically, Europe was up 19% organically driven by particular strength in polymer processing, beverage can making, natural refrigerate systems and heat exchangers. All of Asia was down 1%. China, which represents approximately half of our business in Asia declined by about 10% in Q4, driven by short term impacts from the COVID resurgence. On the bottom chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to foreign exchange, translation and normalizing lead times across several businesses. Now on our cash flow statement on page, slide 7. Free cash flow for the year came in at $585 million, down year-over-year on increased capital expenditures, onetime tax payments and investments and working capital supporting growth. At our current earnings margin, we would expect to generate free cash flow of approximately 13% of revenue in an average year. 2022 free cash flow lagged behind that level, due primarily to elevate a working capital investment striving two thirds of the gap. As previously discussed, our view -- we view incremental investment in inventory over the past two years as productive despite its carrying cost enabling us to deliver 17% cumulative organic top line growth and over 30% growth in absolute EBITDA between 2019 and 2022. We are now focused on extracting back cash invested in inventory. As supply chain is improved in the fourth quarter, we began reducing inventory particularly finished goods. The majority of excess we carry into 2023 is in raw materials and we expect to consume a significant portion of that excess in the first half of the year. In addition to inventory reductions, we expect to collect elevated receivables from the fourth quarter and normalize our payable balances driving significant improvement in working capital in 2023. We also forecast lower CapEx followed following a stepped up cap next year in 2022. As a result, our forecast for 2023 free cash flow is between 15% and 17% of revenue. I'll turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Okay, I'm on slide 8. I'll be brief on this slide since we've been discussing the linkages between bookings, backlog and revenue and expected trajectory of these metrics for nearly two years. First to remind everyone that in 2021 bookings of $9.4 billion driven by post-COVID demand surge, as well as constrained supply chains the required customers drew order in advance were roughly 20% higher than our revenue that year resulting in an unprecedented backlog that requires time to ship and unwind while bookings normalize. Importantly, concerns about double ordering and cancellations did not materialize. And we have been depleting the backlog in an orderly fashion as product lead times improved. If we smooth out the post pandemic surge in bookings our bookings CAGR has been 4% from 2019 to 2022. Let's go to Slide 9 here, we show the growth and margin outlook by segment for 2023. that underpin our guidance. We expect Engineered Products to remain solid. Pent-up demand and automation initiatives and waste hauling support our robust outlook. Despite high demand, our refuse collection vehicles shipments in 2022 is still has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels due to chassis availability. After an excellent performance in vehicle services group in Q4 we expect a slower start in 2023 and Engineered Products is forecast to improve margins in 2023 on solid volumes benefits from our recent productivity capital investments taking hold and positive call price cost tailwinds. Clean Energy & Fueling is expected to grow single digits organically which we expect to be second half weighted due to demand for dispensers during the year. Dispenser bookings beginning to normalize, we expect Q1 to be the trough for the business with gradual recovery through the remainder of the year. All other businesses in the segment are positioned well for growth in 2023, with particular strength in our clean energy components. For the year we expect margin improvements in Clean Energy & Fueling and volume recovery, improved mix and recently enacted restructuring actions and above ground fueling. Imaging & ID is expected to continue its trajectory steady GDP growth and attractive margins. We see robust demand for new printers and components and consumables and professional services the outlook for the bulk serialization and brand protection software is also strong. Margin as business are robust and we expect them to remain as such to 2023. We project flat organic growth in pumps and process solutions. Our industrial pumps and plastics and polymers, precision components and thermo connector businesses are all positioned for solid growth. The biopharma components business is expect to hit its bottom in volume and margin in the first quarter as customers worked through and repurpose excess inventory. We are beginning to see encouraging signs and bookings for our biopharma connectors, and our full year forecasts may prove to be conservative. The long-term tailwinds of single use components for biological drug manufacture remain compelling. And importantly, our products are specified for regulated manufacturing of therapies with attractive growth outlook. And we continue to win new specifications and an active pipeline of new biologic and cell and gene therapies. Margin performance is expected to be roughly flat for the year with a sequentially lower level in the first and second quarters on unfavorable product mix from slower biopharma and geographic mix from higher sales in China, for plastics and polymers. Growth outlook for climate and sustainability technologies remain solid as our businesses continue to ship against strong backlog levels. We are forecasting continued double-digit growth in both natural refrigerant systems and heat exchangers for heat pumps. Our beverage can making businesses booked well into 2023 and expect continued margin improvement in 2023 on volume conversion, productivity gains and mix. Move on to Slide 10. Here we show our recent performance against our capital allocation priorities, our priorities to reinvest in our business, which represents the highest return on investment. 2022 represented a recent record for CapEx with numerous capacity expansions and productivity investments completed. We will continue our efforts to add attractive bolt-on acquisitions to improve our portfolio by entering new markets with secular growth. We invested $325 million into five highly attractive acquisitions in 2022. We're carrying significant firepower in a compelling M&A pipeline into 2023. Finally, as we did in 2022, we will return excess liquidity to our shareholders through increased dividends and opportunistic. Let\u2019s move onto Slide 11. For the wrap up, before we get into our full year guidance I\u2019ll make a few comments on our view of the macro environment and how we believe the year may develop. First and foremost, we hope that the Fed is cautious going forward from here. We support the efforts to tackle inflation, which had had a large hand in causing but we are in the camp that believes the Fed has gone far enough and the lagged effect of the further actions can be problematic to economic growth. Market participants are likely to be cautious with the timing of their demand generating decisions as there is a recognition that manufacturing lead times and logistics constraints have been largely repaired. And as such, we expect first quarter demand to reflect this cautious stance. We expect seasonality to the year to be weighted towards quarters two and three in revenue and earnings and weighted to H1 for cash flow as our balance sheet reflects liquidation of inventory and receivables from 2022. Despite the uncertain macro, our goals remain ambitious, we will push hard to win our share of demand. We have done a lot of work to improve the performance of our products and we believe we would have the right to win. We have proactively expanded capacity to meet projected demand and areas of the portfolio with significant secular growth opportunities. So now let me put our guide in EPS performance of the longer term perspective. Our objectives delivered double-digit through cycle EPS growth for our investors through a balanced mix of healthy revenue growth, margin accretion, value creative capital deployment. We have been delivering on that equipment that had led to that commitment, and we drive will continue to drive to continue to do so. I want to thank our customers for trusting Dover businesses to deliver on their important needs. And I'm grateful to Dover teams across the world for continuing to serve our customers and execute well despite various challenges along the road. That's completes the comments. So Jack, let's go to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. David Ridley-Lane: Good morning, this is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. And so there are different reasons, reasons for each segment. But the guidance assumes better second half growth in three of the five segments. What's kind of the underlying demand assumption? Are you assuming things are fairly stable? Or do you embed kind of a deterioration in underlying demand given you're seeing better second half growth in several segments? Richard Tobin : I think that the feedback that we're getting from our customers is to start off the year cautiously. I think that there's in a lot of portions of the marketplace, there's inventory that needs to be depleted. And I think that there's a concern about the macro. There also is this view that inflation is coming down, and that being prudent about when to start projects is probably going to put them in the money. Furthermore, I think they have a difficult comp in Q1 just because of FX alone. So I don't think there's anything other than as we mentioned, biopharma meeting, getting to the bottom where we expect orders to inflect positively from there. I think it's just an overly cautious stance going into the New Year. Everybody knows that lead times have been prepared -- have been repaired. So it's not as if they have to put the orders in and take and take the deliveries in Q1. So it will actually go back to what had been historically the seasonality of the Dover portfolio, where a little bit of a slow start second quarter and third quarter quite high and then we run for cash in Q4. David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then a quick one on China, I heard you that you'd seen some demand disruptions, given the COVID resurgence. Any concern about labor related disruptions of your operations, were -- are suppliers showing up later this year? Richard Tobin : No. I mean, from a supply standpoint, we are not overly levered towards China with the exception of electronic components, which don't make a disproportionate high amount of our purchases. So no, I don't I think that China, we the stance is it's going to get better from here, not worse. David Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much. Richard Tobin : Welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey Rich, just on the order normalization agreement and talking about this for a long time, do you kind of expect things to revert back to that kind of historical balance for your backlog as, call it 20% or so forward sales by the end of the year? Or do you think this takes a bit longer than normalize? Richard Tobin : Well, a lot of that depends on the macro, Jeff at the end of the day. But yes, I mean, yes, we would expect to go back there. I would call your attention to the slide that we had at the end of Q3 that showed normal backlogs by segment. We would expect to go back there. If 19 is normal. Let's say, I think that's what the comparison, comparative number there is. We would expect it to go back there. Jeff Sprague : And then Rick given\u2026 Richard Tobin : But it may flex over time. And well, again, I'll leave it at that. It will go back to I would call your attention to that slide. And that's where we're going to end up. Jeff Sprague : Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, you're the comments to this prior question kind of touched on this a little bit. The nature of my follow up here is what is the price discussion, like on orders now, now that as you say, as to why chains are normalizing, and there's the expectation that inflation does begin to fade. Do you see downward pressure on price and maybe put that in the context of what your own cost equation looks like in 2023? Richard Tobin : Yes, we've been pretty disciplined in terms of not repricing our backlog. For sure. So I don't expect any issues there that are not manageable. I think that what we can expect at the beginning of this year is everybody having a view -- we're not and this includes us when we deal with our own suppliers that inflation is coming down. And if I, if I spend some time in Q1 renegotiating maybe I can force the issue to a certain extent. So in our estimates, we don't have any unannounced pricing that's not out in the marketplace, meaning that\u2019s not baked into our numbers, another price increase in the June time period. But it's going to be it's, it's going to be interesting to see how it develops over time. I think it's going to be reflected more in a delay in terms of the order rates, until we get into a position of back and forth of do you -- when do you need the product and when do you have to stop negotiating the price? Jeff Sprague : And that algorithm leaves your price cost positive for the year as it stands? Richard Tobin : Yes. Yes. Our estimates are price cost positive for the year based on roll forward, what basically what you see in Q4. Jeff Sprague : Right, thank you. Richard Tobin : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys, good morning. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Steve Tusa : So it just if you have these backlogs, right, and expect them to expect to work them down over the course of the year. Why wouldn't that mean that, assuming that those lead times I mean, they are extended, but I wouldn't think too extended given the nature of your business. Why wouldn't that, liquidation of backlog help kind of the normal seasonality, assuming that you -- your the trend line is what it is, but you're delivering at a backlog which should help sales in the near term. Why are customers not taking this stuff earlier? Richard Tobin : Well, a lot of them are based on their own CapEx plan. So as we as we talked about in the end of Q4 about the decline in dispensers it was kind of interesting to us because we were shipping heavily in the below ground and hardly shipping anything and above ground. And that was a reflection of the delay in getting these projects done because of supply chain constraints and labor and everything else. I think that we're going to see a little, that's an example. We're going to see a little bit of that more in Q1. Right? So despite having the backlog, the customers are not saying, what, deliver it on January 1, and I'll go put it in the warehouse, and I'll pull it out when I want. They just don't feel the need. That's what was kind of going on in the marketplace to a certain extent, for a period of time. As that accordion effect is beginning to unwind. Yes, the backlog is there, but they're saying, what, here's the timing of my project, and I may want it in March. I may want it in April. So the depletion will be orderly over the balance of the year. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then how much price are you, are you assuming this year in the organic? Richard Tobin : I don't think that we disclose that, but it's a good portion of the organic growth is price. Steve Tusa : Okay, and then one last one for you just on orders. I think to get to that level of backlog at the end of the year looks like it's roughly I don't know, like a $2 billion backlog assuming a mid-single digit growth rate, which would imply roughly 6 billion of orders. Is that does that feel about right? Richard Tobin : Let me do it in my head. Yes, that's, that's close. Yes. Steve Tusa : Okay. And\u2026 Richard Tobin : It gets very much it's going to be very much contingent of what happens in the long cycle portion of the business, right? The Maags and the Belvac and to a certain extent, SWEP, which is becoming a long-cycle business, because we're beginning to rather than sell the products and selling capacity. So if those three hang in there, then yes, that's what that's all be. Steve Tusa : Yes. Okay. That, and those would be the toughest comps in the first half. Richard Tobin : Correct. Steve Tusa : Yes. Okay. Great. Thanks. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Hey Joe. Joe Ritchie : So, Rich I just want to make sure I understand your seasonality comments as it relates to the first quarter. Because if I go back to like prior seasonality, you could see, the first quarter being kind of like a high teens percentage of the full year to kind of mid 20s. I mean, if I use the midpoint, it kind of puts me around the $2 range. If I'm doing the math, right. For the first quarter, I just want to make sure that I'm level setting correctly. Richard Tobin : Joe, I don't have Excel open here in front of me. I'd like to just -- look at the end of the day this is just a general statement about the feedback that we're getting from the marketplace, right. Everybody's concerned about recession. And so there's a bias towards being very careful with inventory also included. So we just think that the take off is back to the question that Steve asked before is that the backlog is there, but the take rate on that backlog should start out slowly, right, until everybody gets in place where we can, a lot of what we deliver goes right to the project site. And a lot of cases least the businesses that are tethered to distribution. So I'm, I'm not calling for a collapse in Q1 by any stretch of the margin. But, but we don't want to do it, the only reason that we're calling it out is we're coming out of periods where we had very strong Q1s in the seasonality versus the past got a little bit out of whack. So we're just telling you to just be careful with Q1, the full year is the full year. And we're confident in that. But I think they just we have to be, we have to recognize that is an amount of caution in the marketplace. And everybody's going to be very careful about how much inventory they lay in until they can see what's going on with kind of the macro, per se. Joe Ritchie : Got it. No, that makes sense. I guess maybe my quick follow up, I think last quarter, you guys had called out I think like a roughly $0.23 benefit in DC from the cost actions. And you're continuing to highlight, kind of margin improvement this year. Can you maybe so, firstly, we still on track for that $0.23. And then secondly, across the rest of the portfolio, where are you seeing opportunities for margin expansion in 2023? Richard Tobin : I think all of the $0.23 was not in clean energy. I think $0.19 of the $0.23 if I remember correctly, more or less is in there. Yes. Joe Ritchie : And some of that was in the fourth quarter too. Richard Tobin : And some of that was in the fourth quarter also because we actually took the cost actions in Q3 But everything is on track. What you do as you get -- you get a bad comp in that business because it was still delivering pretty heavily in Q1, but we expect that to be offset by clean energy components and below ground and car wash, which are margin accretive. So you get basically over the year, a positive inflection of mix on the portfolio, but I think you just have to be a little bit careful in Q1 just because the above ground is a bad comp. Joe Ritchie : Got it. Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Rich, could you give us a little more color regarding your expectations for DPPS in 2023. What's your conviction level in terms of biopharma connectors destock ending in Q1? I know you mentioned book is inflected sequentially. And then you're -- just in terms of margin, I know you're forecasting flattish for the year in this segment. Given where Q4 2022 left off, it's not that easy to get there. So maybe you could elaborate on your cost controls and productivity actions in that segment that gets you back to those 2022 levels? Richard Tobin : Yes. Well, we did take cost out as volume came out of the sector for sure, and we did that progressively through the year. And I think we took a further action in the end of Q3, Q4, more or less. Look, orders are beginning to inflect. We are paying a lot of attention to the commentary of our customers out there who are basically saying it's an H1 event and then expect to have all the inventory cleared. I will tell you that we have not been overly ambitious in our estimates for the full year. So I think if we're going to -- I think that we may have a little bit more difficult H1, but I think that we've got a better and even chance to have a better-than-expected performance in the second half of the year. But what we'd like to see is the order rates come up and us start expanding capacity to deal with it, which I think we can turn around to do it. So yes, the flat margins year-over-year. We're going to have to be really careful with our cost controls, and we're going to have to deliver polymers and plastics and precision components are going to have to deliver on the volume that we expect to get out of those businesses. But it's not like we're being overly ambitious in volume in biopharma for the year. Andrew Kaplowitz : Great. And then, Rich, I know you don't want to tell us all about your Investor Day in March. But maybe in terms of -- you've talked about portfolio management a little more frequently lately, so maybe update us on that. And then obviously, you talked at the beginning of your prepared comments around SKU management. We know you've been really focused on costs. So in terms of longer-term margin targets, anything to sort of talk about their preview there? I assume margins can rise pretty significantly from where they ended in 2022? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean that's going to be part of it Andy, at the end of the day. So let's not the card before the horse, but we're going to basically do what we did back in 2019 and try to give you a 3-year forward role by segment and what we think the contributing factors to it. I mean a lot of it is going to be on-going productivity, but I think what's underestimated is that the organic revenue potential is underestimated. And I think we've done a lot of work in terms of mix here. So the mix of the products that we have today versus what we started with in 2020 is, I think, a lot different than that was back then. So it's not some ambitious we're going to grow completely out of the order. I think we'll grow higher than basically the market expects us because we generally get bottom quartile expected growth rates and revenue, but I think mix is going to be the most important aspect of it. Andrew Kaplowitz : Do you expect to give a specific target around organic growth? Or is it like GDP plus? Richard Tobin : I don't know yet. Andrew Kaplowitz : Fair enough. Thanks Rich. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hey good morning guys. Richard Tobin : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : The -- I probably asked this a couple of quarters ago, but the M&A markets, Richard, they come down to kind of more realistic levels for you guys and expect to be a little bit more active in 2023? Richard Tobin : Well, I guess taking on any leverage to do a deal has not been well received by anybody. So I guess we'd have to be careful with a larger deal presently for whatever reason, the capital markets are not looking kindly on leverage for, I guess, the reasons we can understand about unsurety of the macro going forward. But yes, I think that what we've seen so far is that a realistic multiples are now becoming -- are reflective of what's going on in the capital markets. So you always have -- most of our deals are private, as you know, private companies. There's always a lag between the public capital markets at a private valuation. I think that, that has narrowed towards to the public capital markets. Scott Davis : Okay. And I don't like the traffic of minutia [ph], but is there such a thing as a can-making cycle? I mean what -- it seems like we've had pretty high demand year for several years in a row. What -- what's in the other side of it? Is there a big investment cycle now and that it's just kind of air pockets after that? Or is there some new dynamic involved in that world? Richard Tobin : Yes, I'm not allowed to say that the AP, right because the CTAs love to pick up on that step. But yes, look, I mean, it is a cyclical business and there are investment cycles and part and parcel is to not over capacitize yourself as the cycle goes up and the recapture on the spare parts, which are margin accretive on the way down. So that's the way that we look at the business. Now having said that, it will be interesting to see what happens with PET in drinks going forward. I know that there's been a little bit of a pushback on ESG lately. But the fact of the matter is that PET from an environmental point of view is not a preferred option. So to the extent that the cost plus ESG aspect of PET over time make aluminum more attractive, then we could -- that is by far the largest portion of the market. So even if a recapture rate of 15% of PET market would drive another cycle. So that's kind of where we are right now. Scott Davis : All right. Good luck guys in 2023. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hey good morning guys. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Rich, so you've been sort of holographing what's happened with orders and backlog and kind of watching the Fed movements for a while now and been more concerned about them we're doing it. Does your view of kind of downturn management look different because of some of the scarcity that we've had the last 2 years in terms of hiring folks, looking for new suppliers, maybe honoring existing agreements? Does any of that look different with the recovery on the other side we kind of have more of the same scarcity that we've had in the past. Richard Tobin : Yes. I wouldn't expect to run into the logistics constraints that we've seen. I think that was a one-off. I mean, you had just such a collapse of the macro and then a restart and then add a lot of the energy markets went haywire which drove the logistics market say, well, I don't expect that to happen. I mean I think that capacity was brought on. And if you look at logistics costs and the forward curves there, I don't expect that to repeat under any reasonable macro scenario from here. I think there is a lot of liquidity that's being taken from the general market. I think that lending is very low right now. It's very difficult to get loans and secure loans -- secure liquidity to run businesses out there. I'm not making it a Dover comment. I'm talking in total. So I'm concerned about that. And if that's the case, and there's the only way that if you're a private company, the only way you can generate liquidity in order to continue to fund yourself is to draw down inventory balances to extremely low levels, and that's negative to orders and revenue going forward. So that's our overall concern of -- I don't see the point of bringing out another 50 basis points only to turn around and give the 50 basis points back into Q4. Why bother? Why can't we just sit where we're standing right here because liquidity in the market is incredibly tight right now. So that's the fear. At the end of the day is that you have a delayed CapEx cycle, which we ascribe to the fact that there is a CapEx need out there because of productivity to offset higher labor costs, and then you've got all the stimulus money out there. But fact of the matter is there's no liquidity to accompany that I think that you have a delay effect that could be problematic. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just thinking about the 4Q orders, any sense from you guys as lead times have improved that this is sort of the quarter where customers kind of squeeze the accordion on, hey, we don't need things 16 weeks earlier than normal anymore. So let's get back to maybe more normal ordering pace. Like -- is there an artificial low that you go through on orders as lead times normalize? Or is that something that's kind of barely perceptible over the medium term? Richard Tobin : No, that's exactly what we think, and we think it's going to continue through Q1. And then from there, we expect based on our view of the demand cycle that it will inflect positively from there. But I think you're going to get another quarter of exactly how you described it, right? I know I can get the product. I have enough inventory to carry me through the quarter. I'm going to take the chance of depleting it because I know you can deliver into Q2. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Very helpful. Thanks. Best of luck guys. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Guy Hardwick from Credit Suisse. Guy Hardwick : Hi good morning. Richard Tobin : Hi, good morning. Guy Hardwick : Rich, I think on the last call, you talked about a fundamental change in the business model in DCF. Are you ready to talk a bit more about that today? Richard Tobin : Well, I would leave that to the Investor Day, right? I mean, I think that my comment was is that -- we went through this period of EMV and then we went through this period of the overhype EV taking over the world, and we were basically saying that we believe that we can position this business to harvest profits for 20 years. And I think that we're -- we've made the moves in Q3 of this year to begin to position ourselves appropriately there, right? So there was no sense of doing it in advance of a rising revenue curve. But now that it flattens out, we've got to run the business differently on one hand. And on the other hand, we've been a pretty active acquirer in that particular segment as we transition to clean energy exposure, particularly in the hydrogen space. So we're doing it -- but I would -- if you're looking for, what does that mean going forward from here in a holistic way, why don't we wait until March and we'll surely talk about it. Guy Hardwick : And just a follow-up. Could you clarify that backlog math? Where do you think you could be at the end of the year? Richard Tobin : Why don't we take this off-line because everybody's got a different calculation of if it's -- I think that there was 20% of the annual revenue should be in backlog in a normal time. So we got what our forecast is for revenue for this year. So it's a relatively easy calculation. Guy Hardwick : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Hi, good morning everyone. So Rich, a couple of ground here. But just going back to the caution. You seem to talk about inventory and your inventory management more so than projects. I'm just wondering if you have to generalize, would you say the cautions more on CapEx? Or is it more the channel partners managing inventory levels very tightly. And would you say it's U.S. versus Europe? Would you say both are in the same camp? Or would you say the U.S. is right now where you've seen the more caution? Richard Tobin : I think it's a U.S.-centric comment. I mean if you look at our growth rate in Europe, I don't think anybody would have modeled that considering kind of the overall caution about Europe in total, but frankly, a lot of what we do out of our production base in Europe gets -- we recognize the revenue in Europe, but it may end up around the world at the end of the day. But I think -- it's more -- we don't -- our exposure in terms of -- our exposure is larger in North America, so it's largely a North American comment. I don't -- I think that Europe, any kind of let's call it destocking would have happened during this past year because they were on the front end of the curve. Nigel Coe : Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then just you mentioned free cash flow more loaded to the first half of the year, which is obviously very unusual. You mentioned that the bulk of your excess inventories were material. So that doesn't seem to have an impact on your fixed cost absorption. But I'm wondering as you go through the inventory management, are you expecting there to be some margin penalty as you build inventories? Richard Tobin : No. Actually, I think that in our models, it's a margin credit as we liquidate it because if you look at forwards based on when we bought that inventory sequentially grew 2022. It's actually -- and you can see it in our margins in some of the sectors, that's part and parcel to this price cost. Look, at the end of the day, yes. If I go back and look over the last couple of years, we made a significant investment in inventory and that allowed us to deliver revenue growth that was above expectation. So now lead times and availability and capacity is repaired itself. So we get almost a triple effect of -- we liquidate kind of the excess raw materials that we've been carrying to meet demand because we slowed down production in Q4, our payables balance dropped significantly. So from a net working capital point of view, we got the negative of shipping heavily in Q4. So there's a big receivable balance that gets liquidated build probably in the latter half of Q1, but more in Q2, our payables expand and then we collect on that receivables balance. So all three come in, in the first half. Nigel Coe : Makes sense. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And our last question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe, Rich, you'd mentioned mix once or twice as a factor, and we can obviously see that impact in DPPS as well documented. I just wanted to circle back to the DII segment. There was a mixed tailwind, I think, in fourth quarter possible headwind in the year ahead guided and that's weighing on the margins there. Maybe expand a little bit on that. And DEP had an exceptional margin expansion, albeit off an easy base. Is there anything much moving around on mix in DEP? Richard Tobin : In DEP, no, I think rightly, I would look at DEP sequentially as opposed to comp, right? We all know what happened in Q4 of 2022. So that's why we had been saying all year that not to worry because as price cost rolls forward, you're going to get what you get. But I would look at DEP on a sequential basis as a precursor of what you can expect into 2023. And the other question you had was on marking and coding, right? Julian Mitchell : Yes. Richard Tobin : That is just a function of the amount of consumables we shipped in any given period, meaning the more that you ship in printers, that is negative to margins. The more that you ship in consumables, it's positive. It's going to bounce around. I think that our comment that we made on that particular business is that the margins are quite robust, and it's all about what kind of revenue growth we can get from here. We're not calling it down for 2023. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on kind of firm-wide Dover operating margin. So I think the operating margin overall was flattish in 2022. It's guided maybe to grow a little bit in 2023. I just wondered with that backdrop, is there the appetite maybe to accelerate restructuring spend. I saw in your guide, you've got kind of $0.10, I think, for 2023 after $0.20 last year. But I wondered just sort of thinking ahead, is there maybe the appetite to drive -- make sure that 2024, let's say, has stronger margin expansion and that might require more restructuring this year. Richard Tobin : Well, Julian, I mean, I think to the extent that we have flat margins despite the fact that our biopharma business, which is clearly our most profitable portion of the portfolio being down, one could argue that once we get to the strong -- we get through this destocking period, which we expect to be an H1 2023 event is that inflect back to the positive that the incremental margins that we're going to see there. And all things being equal, we hold and continuing to improve the balance of the portfolio that, that by itself is margin accretion. But I think I would call your attention to what we've done in Climate & Sustainability. We think that that's got room to run. We think that we've gotten DPPS we've just talked about. I think we've got some growth there. and we've got the return of biopharma in the second half of the year, which by I'll repeat myself, I don't think we've been overly ambitious with that. We think we're going to keep that in our back pocket and see how the market develops. And the roll forward on the Engineered Products, if we look at what our exit rate is and we roll that forward, I think that's quite healthy from a margin point of view. So back to the restructuring. Look, we're always scouring our fixed costs around here. Our management is incentivized to deliver fixed cost reduction and incremental margins. So I would expect we'll continue to do so, but I don't see any need to accelerate it to protect our performance going forward. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Richard Tobin : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call.

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director of Investor Relations. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens, please go ahead, sir. Jack Dickens : Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through May 17 and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Dover provides non-GAAP information and reconciliations between GAAP and adjusted measures are included in our investor supplement and presentation materials, which are available on our website. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everybody. Let's start with the performance highlights on Slide 3. The quarter was solid overall. We are very pleased with our production performance to start the year which allowed us to begin reducing our inventory balances towards the end of the quarter. Consolidated organic revenue was up 3%, with growth across most of our businesses driven largely by the secular growth tailwinds that we outlined at our most recent Investor Day. The majority of our input and supply chain constraints have dissipated, resulting in production lead times largely returning to pre-pandemic levels. This has led to more normalized order patterns, improved shipping volumes and a gradual reduction of elevated backlog. New order intake was robust in the quarter with four out of five segments posting book-to-bill of one. New bookings increased sequentially in the first quarter, and our order backlog remains elevated compared to normal levels providing us with good visibility for the remainder of the year. During the quarter, we de-booked some volume from our backlog and retail refrigeration from a single customer, was put the timing of 2023 capital plan under review. Our expectation is that we'll be rebooking the volume in the second half. Margin performance in the quarter was strong with four out of our five segments improving margins over 100 basis points, driven by broad-based productivity gains, positive price/cost dynamics and prior period investments and cost containment actions. Higher segment earnings performance drove our EPS growth. We had some comparable cost headwinds during the quarter from transitory inorganic activity costs, higher interest expense, FX and tax. Brad will review later. Interest costs are set to drop progressively for the balance of the year and FX at current rates turns into a comparable tailwind in the back half. Our recent investments in automation and productivity projects are paying off, and we are in the process of completing several capacity expansions in our secular growth businesses. The acquisition of Witte in our Pumps & Process Solutions segment, which we completed in December last year is off to a great start and is performing above expectations. Our strong financial position allows us to pursue a healthy pipeline of attractive bolt-on acquisitions and to opportunistically return capital to our shareholders. We are encouraged by the trends and performance so far in 2023. We have a constructive but also watchful outlook for the remainder of the year. Overall, demand conditions in our attractive industrial markets remain solid and our bookings are healthy. Our order backlogs, especially in our longer-cycle businesses provide good visibility to our forecast. We are on track to deliver our full year cash flow target as we liquidate inventory in concert with the normalization of our backlog. We are mindful of the mix to macro economic backdrop, and we are staying close to our customers to understand their plans. We have available cost control levers and operational flexibility that should enable us to deliver good results in various macroeconomic environments. With that, we maintain our 2023 full year guidance, 3% to 5% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $8.85 to $9.05 per share. I'll skip Slide 4. Let's move on to the segments. Engineered Products was up 3% organically in the quarter, driven by positive pricing, strong demand for waste handling equipment parts and related digital services. The chassis availability issues that impacted the waste handling business coming out of the pandemic have improved. And to the extent that, that supply continues to be available, we are well positioned to increase shipments meaningfully against strong underlying demand. Margins were up 230 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by improving supply chains, positive price cost dynamics, mix and as well as investments in productivity initiatives. Clean Energy and Fueling declined by 3% on an organic basis. Revenue is up in clean energy components, vehicle wash, fuel transport and below-ground retail fueling, offset by the expected comparable decline in dispenser and EMV card reader demand. The upcoming second quarter comp is the last of material EMV volume. We remain constructive on the business for the full year as order activity in March was healthy. Despite the lower volume, margins in the quarter were up 120 basis points on positive mix and price cost as well as improved comparable cost structure from previously announced cost reduction actions taken in the retail fueling business. Imaging and ID posted a solid quarter, up 8% organically on broad-based strength in our marking and coding printers, spare parts and consumables. Our serialization software business continues to perform well and win new accounts. FX remained a negative headwind to absolute revenue and profits in this segment that drove a large base of non-U.S. dollar revenue. Margins in Imaging and ID were very strong at 24%, improving 260 basis points on volume, conversion, pricing actions and mix. Pumps & Process Solutions declined 7% organically in the quarter, driven principally by the post-COVID transition in the biopharma space. New orders for biopharma grew sequentially during the quarter as the impacts from inventory destocking begin to subside. At the current trajectory, we expect to have one more quarter of headwinds then inflect positively in the second half of the year. All the other businesses in this segment posted solid organic growth during the quarter with particular strength in precision components, industrial pumps, thermal connectors and polymer processing equipment. Operating margin was down against a peak comparable quarter in the prior year due to the mix effect from higher non-biopharma revenue. Top line and Climate and Sustainable Technologies continued its double-digit growth trajectory from the last two years, posting 16% organic growth. Demand trends remain particularly robust in heat exchangers and CO2 refrigeration systems, driven by global investments in sustainability. Beverage can making continued shipping deliveries against its strong backlog. Margins came in at 16% in the quarter, up 280 basis points year-over-year on strong volume conversion, productivity, positive price/cost and good mix of products delivered. I'll pass it to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6. The top bridge shows organic revenue growth of 3%, driven by increases in three of our five segments. Acquisitions contributed $19 million to the top line in the quarter. FX translation was a substantial headwind at 2.5% and or $52 million and impacted both our revenue growth and profitability. FX headwinds resulted in $0.06 of negative EPS impact in the quarter. At today's prevailing rates, we expect these FX headwinds to subside as the year progresses against easier comps with roughly $0.10 of negative FX impact forecasted for the first half of the year and $0.05 of favorability in the second half. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market, was up 3% organically in the quarter. Europe and Asia were flat and down 4%, respectively, on timing, of comparable shipments. We expect organic growth in both regions for the full year. On the bottom chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to foreign currency translation, normalization of lead times across several businesses and a $90 million order de-booking related to a major retail refrigeration customer's decision to temporarily pause its new store expansion program. Now let's move to cash flow on Slide 7. Free cash flow for the quarter came in at $193 million or 9% of revenue. This represents a record first quarter free cash flow and was up over $200 million year-over-year. The first quarter is historically our lowest cash flow quarter due to seasonality of investments in working capital to support growth in the year ahead. As discussed previously, our supply chains -- with supply chains improving, we have been actively working to liquidate our working capital balances in 2023 and we are beginning to see the results materialize. We expect our working capital balances and particularly our inventories to reduce over the balance of the year and to be a significant driver of year-over-year cash flow. Excluding any impacts from acquisitions, we should materially pay down commercial paper balances over the next several quarters. As a result, we would expect interest expense to decline by $10 million between the first half and second half of the year. Our forecast for 2023 free cash flow remains on track for between 15% and 17% of revenue. I'll turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : All right. Let's go to Slide 8. Here, we show the growth in margin outlook by segment for 2023 that are underpinned by our current bookings and backlog trends. I'll make a few summary comments before I jump into the segments. First, our lead times have largely normalized across the portfolio. We highlighted in the chart our good backlog levels are primarily driven by a handful of operating businesses that are either a long cycle in nature or experience -- are experiencing secular growth where there is a supply-demand deficit or both. Next, our expectation going into the year was that order rates would normalize in an orderly fashion because the repaired supply chains, removed the rationale for customers to order for in advance. Order rates in the first quarter were strong across most businesses which is a positive indicator for our full year revenue targets, which do not require us to -- which do not require book-to-bill above one every quarter due to the aforementioned backlogs. We expect growth in Engineered Products to remain solid, driven by pricing carryover as well as pent-up demand and improved chassis availability in refuse collection vehicles. We expect trading conditions in aerospace and defense, industrial automation and which is to remain constructive following two years of excellent volume growth, we expect vehicle aftermarket to be stable. Engineered Products are set to improve margins in 2023 on solid volumes benefits from our recent productivity capital investments taking hold and positive price cost tailwinds. Clean Energy and fueling should grow low single digits organically, and solid demand in all businesses except aboveground dispensers, the constructive booking rates and customer sentiment in the dispenser business point to improvement from here with Q2 being the last quarter of negative EMV mix impact. For the year, we expect margin improvement in Clean Energy and Fueling volume recovery, improved mix, proactive restructuring actions in aboveground fueling and we expect revenue and absolute earnings growth to be entirely second half weighted for this segment as EMV volume comps fade. Imaging and ID is expected to continue its mid-single-digit growth trajectory through the year. We see robust demand for our printers, consumables and professional services and the outlook for our software offerings is also strong after some recent customer wins. Full year margins should remain attractive for this segment. We project flat organic growth for the year in Pumps & Process Solutions. Quoting activity remains strong in industrial pumps, the plastics and polymers business continues to deliver against record backlog levels with particular strength in the U.S. and in China, the Witte Pumps acquisition provides much-needed capacity to our MOD business. Demand for engineered bearings and compressor components remains robust with a notable mix in order rates towards energy transition markets, such as hydrogen, LNG and carbon capture. Thermal connector continues to grow well into the double digits. In biopharma, we expect the business to remain at current conditions in the second quarter and return to growth in the second half of the year as order rates continue to improve. As we discussed during the Analyst Day, the long-term tailwinds for single-use components for biological drug manufacturing are robust. Our full year margin target for this segment is approximately 30%. The growth outlook for climate and sustainability technologies is solid as our businesses continue to ship against strong backlog levels. We are forecasting continued double-digit growth in both natural refrigerant systems and heat exchanges for heat pumps. We expect some second quarter headwinds in refrigeration cases due to the aforementioned debooking impacting fixed cost absorption, but we remain constructive on the overall demand and continue to expect our multiyear journey of margin improvement for the business. Beverage can making is booked for the next several quarters, and we have some very interesting opportunities in the pipeline. We expect continued margin improvement in 2023 on volume conversion, productivity gains and mix. Go to Slide 9. Here, we show the range of new-to-market products and the status of some of our important expansion projects that allow us to sustain our competitive advantages in our marketplaces. We are very bullish on the long-term value creation opportunity for these new product launches. You'll see each of these products touch sustainability, digitization or biopharma and hygienic applications. Our growth and capacity expansion projects are progressing well, whether behind our heat exchangers, natural refrigerant systems or biopharma businesses. Each of these applications are growing in double digits. Over the long term, these will be important drivers of our underappreciated organic growth story. Our previously announced restructuring within the retail fueling segment is on track as we transform this business model. We also took some incremental footprint restructuring actions in retail fueling in Europe in the first quarter, and we have several ongoing projects across other operating companies as well. Let's wrap up on Slide 10. Dover's portfolio consists of a range of niche middle market industrial franchises with significant diversification from a product and end market exposure perspective, many of which we believe are secular growth tailwinds. Our supply chains are not overly complicated, and our manufacturing operations are lean and getting leaner. We believe our diverse end market exposure together with our flexible operating model and value-added center-led initiatives will continue to be a competitive advantage for us regardless of the macroeconomic environment. We believe that we have line of sight for our full year forecast and a range of available cost levers to ensure we deliver. With that, so -- with that, we are maintaining our full year 2023 guidance. So Jack, let's go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Rich, as Brad pointed out, if you get these inventories normalize, the cash comes through, you delever pretty quickly. I just wonder what you're seeing on the M&A side of the equation and are there things that are actionable in the pipeline in 2023 in your view? And also just wonder if you'd comment on potential interest in Carrier's refrigeration business, which [indiscernible] on us this morning. Richard Tobin : I'll take the second one first. I know, I think it's just a purchase, I would say no, but I think that's early days to see what happens in the space. Any activity in the space in total is interesting. I'll leave it at that. In terms of M&A, yes, we took some cost in Q1 around inorganic activity. So, I guess that's an indication that we're working on some things that we hope to get across the line. I can tell you, overall, there's not a lot coming to market for all the reasons we can understand. But the good news is that multiples are now converged with the public markets and the competitiveness or lack of PE participation is helpful. So more to come, but I think that we're pleased with what we got going on in the pipeline. Jeff Sprague : And then just on this debooking, I mean, are you seeing any other signs that retailers are just wavering either on new stores or remodeling or do you think this is truly a one-off? And I think you said you expect it to actually rebook at some point later in the year. Richard Tobin : Yes. This was more of a one particular customer basically revisiting strategically what their intent is. So it's our customer. We expect that process to take somewhere between four to six months, and at that point, we go back. It just wasn't -- we could have kicked the can here and just left it in backlog, but then it becomes a problem in terms of inventory in our planning process. So we just took the -- we just made the decision just to debook it out of backlog, it is a one-off. I mean, right now, what I'm hearing -- what we're hearing from our clients is, again, they're still having trouble getting the labor. They're still unhappy with the inflation cost of doing their builds, but they'd continue to like to do the build. So the demand is still strong. This one is just a strategic issue as opposed to kind of an overall commentary on the market. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Can you just talk about the -- what you expect to see here in the second quarter? I think you made some comments in the 10-Q about some of the organic growth rates. It seems like everything is relatively stable, but then we have to take into account the debooking in the refrigeration business. Is that roughly how we should think about organic growth in the second quarter? I know the comps are kind of all over the place these days, but maybe just a little color on the sequential trend there. Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean I think that we would have expected to build some of that product in Q2. So, that's a bit of a headwind there. But quite frankly, the bigger issue for Q2 is the last remaining quarter of bio and EMV. So to me, Q2 is always going to be, from a comp point of view, sort of like Q1 to a certain extent, but we really feel good about the back half of the year because the comps roll forward and all of the bottom below the line charges, call it that, for a lack of a better word, actually roll positive. So yes, I mean, Q2 should look a lot like Q1 relative comp to comp. Steve Tusa : Relative comp to comp, but I mean absolute you usually do step up quarter-to-quarter like just on an absolute EPS basis? I mean, are we assuming normally -- should we take normal seasonality and just subtract the door cancellation? Richard Tobin : No, I mean, I wouldn't get too hung up on trying to monetize the math on the door cancellation. It is a bit of a headwind in Q2. What I'm saying is, if you look at Q1 to Q1, Q2 is going to be similar in terms of Q2 to Q2 comp. There's a step up in volume there. Brad Cerepak : Yes. So, I would say the historical first half to second half is not applicable at this stage. It's a little bit more to the back half as we said before, Steve. Steve Tusa : Okay. That makes sense. And then, Rich, you've been among -- sorry, just on price cost. Any update there for the year? What are you guys seeing on those numbers? Richard Tobin : I think we're not really taking any more meaningful price action. I mean, I think in certain areas, yes, but I mean, I think we're happy to just continue to get what's already baked into the system. Steve Tusa : Okay. So you're positive, though, on a price cost spread basis? Richard Tobin : Yes, I mean, our expectation is to be positive for the full year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Rich, so, I know how much you love talking about orders, but let's do that. If we exclude the order reversal in climate, your book-to-bill was over 1 in Q1, and you're on pace for an order number, closer to $8 billion in the numbers we discussed last quarter. I think you said that order lead times have already mostly normalized. So at this point, is it looking more likely that you'll not go back to that sort of more normalized backlog at least this year and the book-to-bill may remain healthier than you previously thought? Richard Tobin : Oh, boy. Orders in Q1 were better than we had modeled. And interestingly, just to give a little color of it, it was all in March. So it was tracking the way that we thought it was going to track. We would expect it to be below one in Q1 just because of the size of the backlog and the non need to order so far in advance, but March was very healthy. So it's early days. If that pace keeps up, that's great for our full year volume forecast, but like I said before in the comments, we don't need to be above one every quarter for the balance of the year to hit our numbers. So, it's early days. I think that overall, we're pleased with the book-to-bill of Q1 because it's a little bit better than expected. Remember, but you have to recall, remember numerator and denominator Q2 and Q3, we step up on the shipment side, right? So you need almost a greater inflection of orders to stay above one from there. So, we'll see how it goes, but will take better-than-expected book-to-bill in Q1 [indiscernible]. Andy Kaplowitz : Yes, that's helpful, Rich. And then maybe just on CST, again, you obviously still have very high backlog coverage. Even with the debooking. So when you look at the business, I know you're still forecasting mid-single-digit growth about the Q2 issue. But is that mid-single-digit growth really more of a minimum given sort of the capacity additions you've got and the strength in heat exchangers and CO2 systems? And how durable is the growth you think as you go forward, even if economic conditions get a little more difficult? Richard Tobin : Well, we're very prospective on the CO2 systems and on the heat exchanger side, which is the reason that we're expanding capacity. So that capacity is going to take basically the balance of the year to progressively come online. We probably could sell some of that capacity if it was in place now, but we think that we still in the March in terms of our capacity build versus our competitors there. So, we're bringing it online as fast as we can, but you can't sacrifice quality, and there's a variety of other things that you need to do to get it done. The swing factor will be, as I mentioned in the comments, that we have some interesting projects in Belvac, which we would expected Belvac to cycle down some in Q2, which I think we talked about at the beginning of the year. If we were able to book that, that would be a positive in terms of back-end growth. And look, at the end of the day, we expect to rebook the refrigeration business in the second half of the year. But I will tell you that, that cost structure of that business is much more flexible than it's been in the past. So even if we were to miss a little bit in terms of the top line growth there, I don't think that we're going to see the margin dilution that you would have seen historically. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : So first question, I guess, maybe just following up on Andy's question on orders. Rich, what's the price positively in March from an order standpoint? Richard Tobin : North American dispensers, I think was a positive surprise, and we wouldn't -- we were not expecting that to inflect until the back half of the year. Heat exchangers, I mean, I think that if we really wanted to go get the orders now, we could basically book the balance of the year in terms of backlog. That's been good. Printing ID, if you look at the performance of Q1 has been excellent. I mean that's a business that I don't think anybody models an 8% growth rate there at some really good margins. So, I mean it's broad-based in the portfolio. I think what we're most pleased with, I guess, is that biopharma inflected, right? Because we -- you see our customers now reporting their earnings of the week. We were kind of three quarters in front of everybody else in the destocking. So, we feel good about basically this inflecting in the second half of the year. And I think that we've had a more positive view, I think, on retail fueling then, I guess, the market would expect and if March orders are a precursor, I think we feel good about our full year estimates. Joe Ritchie : Awesome. No, that's great. And it's a good segue into biopharma, right? So, it seems like you're probably at a trough margin for the segment in 1Q, I think you're still expecting the margins for the year to be pretty much flat year-over-year versus last year. So that would imply a pretty significant improvement from here. How do you think about the cadence of that improvement over the coming quarters? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, the negative comp is less so in Q2 than Q1. It was pretty significant in Q1, as you can see from the margin performance. It's still negative in Q2 and it reflects positively in the second half. The interesting part about it is we really never lost operating margin on the lower volume. We actually preserved margins. We just lost all of the volume and all the gross margin associated with that volume. So more interesting thing about targeting 30% for the full year is the balance of that segment is growing very well, and it's dilutive to biopharma. So to get to 30%, it does -- it's interesting that if those parts of the portfolio grow significantly or at least stay on the track that they're on right now, we probably have a little bit of difficulty to reach 30% just because of the portfolio effect of the segment itself. But better news is, we've been waiting now, but biopharma looks like it turns from a headwind at the half to a tailwind going forward, and we'd expect that tailwind to be material in '24. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Brad, a question. Now that you guys are a HVAC heat pump company, or can we just talk about swap a little bit? I think Carrier just talked about the market tripling for European heat pumps, you've highlighted swap capacity additions in one of the key areas for expansion for your company. You highlighted order upside in this business. Do you guys have enough capacity to keep up with this tripling of the market? And how do you see -- I know that you and Alfa Laval sort of at the top of the market right now? How do you see sort of incremental competition sort of coming in and screwing up this market? Richard Tobin : We have not had the time to digest what Carrier put out there in terms of the marketplace. So, I'll take a pause on that. We -- but we have been participating in the growth of the European heat pump market now for several years. I think that we are proactive in terms of building out our capacity. As we mentioned, we -- our target is to increase capacity early in '24 by 50% for SWEP. So part of winning share is to have the available capacity at the right product quality at the right price point. So that's all we can do. So we would expect that we'll be, we'll receive part of whatever estimates you want to make about what the future is in terms of heat pump growth from here, but we don't think it's just a European phenomenon. We'd expect that technology to be adopted progressively over the balance of the world driven a lot by regulation and that's why we're not just expanding our capacity in Europe, we've actually expanded in Asia and the United States also. Andrew Obin : And just the question, you would agree with you on the impact of order rates, supply chain normalization and order rates. It does seem you're starting to release working capital. Where are you just in your broader thinking about the balance between the state of economy credit availability and just brought -- I'm not asking about Dover, I'm not asking about Dover order rates, right, but just order rates for industrial economy as a whole because I think you have sort of great insights over the past 24 months about the entire dynamic? Richard Tobin : Yes, I can't remember the Sammy Hagar song about like one foot on the gas and one on the brake. That's the way we're trying to run it here, right. That meaning that there's a lot of macro uncertainty in the marketplace, we think that we've got some tailwinds. But we can't just be blind, of not watching our own balance sheet. And quite frankly, we've been carrying excess inventory for two years around here. So, it was natural for us to kind of liquidate. Our watch points are the businesses that we have that are subject to constriction in credit. So to pick one and not to be overtly negative here, I mean, our car wash business requires is largely driven in a certain way of entrepreneurs getting loans and building out carwash. Well, the fact of the matter is that credit is going to be tightened. Now, does that open up the door for our big retail clients to now meaningfully move into the carwash space? We'll see. So, there's a lot of moving parts here. At the end of the day, my personal view, it's going to be a consumer driven recession, and in which I think that we're going to get. I think, whether that negativity is fully offset by the amount of capital that is going into kind of the regulatory regime or reshoring or a variety of other tailwinds that we talked about during the Investor Day, our position right now is, yes, all right. But that implies really no degradation of the macro in a meaningful way from here kind of like a slow let the air out of a balloon as opposed to a shock. So, we're going to have a management meeting here as soon as this Q&A is done, and part of what we're going to do is basically go business by business and say, all right, what's your plan to meet your numbers for the year and what's your plan, if we run into trouble, right. We've got we have no choice but to run the corporation that way. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Mike Halloran : By the way nice -- I Can't Drive 55 Sammy Hagar restaurant, anyways, maybe just following up on that last question there. How are you guys thinking about the or what are you seeing on the larger CapEx side from the what, later cycle, longer cycle type stuff? Are you seeing any change in the purchase patterns there? And obviously, that's not the climate at the booking but any real change on that side or anything notable? Richard Tobin : Well, we're modeled in a reduction in CapEx in beverage can make, right after going we had a pretty good three-year run of a lot of build out there and if you go look at what the big can makers are saying they're kind of pausing and getting their footing together. But that was modeled into our forecasts. And heat pumps, I think, the issues is your, so we'll leave that alone for the time being. On the retail fuelling side, it's actually the amount of negativity around that I think is overcooked, because we do see a lot of CapEx still there. We still expect a lot of consolidation there, which drives CapEx when those retail operations are, you basically have taking smaller stations and building much more larger complex stations, which is good for us. But Mike at the end of the day, plastics in terms of raw production of capacity expansion, particularly in Asia and North America is quite good despite energy costs moving up a little bit. So, the watch points for us is more credit tightness and how that affects CapEx for kind of not for big OEMs but for kind of like the second layer, that's where we think there may be some tightness. Mike Halloran : No, that makes sense. And on the flip side of that coin on the short cycle side and trends on that side been relatively stable from a seasonality perspective or any real movement there? Richard Tobin : It's been relatively stable. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : One point I just wanted to check in on was on DEP, which I don't think has got much attention yet. But you had a very good margin expansion year-on-year, in the first quarter down sequentially. Just trying to understand sort of as we think about margins for the year that they're growing, I think for the year as a whole. Is that all kind of first half loaded? Do you think we should see decent margin expansion as you move through the year? And is the sort of the flattish vehicle aftermarket guide, does that have any margin impact or it's a sort of similar margin to the segment? Richard Tobin : The margins should go up into Q4. So you're rightly, if you go back and look at Q4 margin, we would expect Q1 margin that come down solely on production performance. So, we would expect it to come down but from a comp point of view from here, we'd expect to have accretive margins up until Q4 and then we'll see how we end the year because I think our margins are quite robust. On the vehicle, calling that market flat, right, so it's not a negative in terms of consolidated margin from the segment instead that's more of a top line comment, as opposed to a margin comment. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then, just my follow up, I know you tried to give some Q2 commentary when prompted and in the spirit of letting no good deed go unpunished. We've had a lot of questions on your second quarter sort of commentary. So, I just wondered if you could put any kind -- fully understand you do not guide quarterly, but I don't know if there was any finer point you could put on that second quarter color, you kind of saying that EPS in Q1 was up low single digit year on year, and so the second quarter doesn't look too different from that year on year performance? Richard Tobin : I think it's more Julian of the performance in terms of revenue and margin looks, comp to comp looks similar. Now, having said that, we had an $0.08 of EPS headwind of kind of below the line segment headwinds, which we believe dissipates. So I don't want to get into EPS accretion guidance quarter to quarter, but we did it. So, it looks -- if you look at Q2, if you look at the performance, relative performance Q1 to Q1 comp and do the same for Q2 to Q2 comp, it should look similar probably without some of the headwind that we saw on the below the line items. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : A lot of territories been covered here, so I don't want to beat a dead horse. But Rich, would it be fair to say, you know, you said earlier that better than expected book-to-bill in the quarter that that comment is clear, but was it also better than expected price in that book-to-bill in the quarter? I mean, piecing it together, it sounds like the answer's yes, but I haven't explicitly heard you say that. Richard Tobin : No, but the price that we have, the price that the accretion from price overall is just peanut buttered over what we see the sequential revenue growth is for the full year. And so, it's not as if we've put new pricing out there. And so that book-to-bill is kind of more accretive that what we have modeled, at the end of the day, I'd have to go back and take a look in terms of mix but as you can imagine around here, calculating mix effect on that many revenue streams is a bit difficult. But, overall, Scott, it was, we knew we were carrying big backlogs into '23 and we knew, and our customers knew that our lead times were coming down quite a bit. So we would expect it kind of to do more of a bleed off of not necessarily the backlog, but it would reflect it in the lower order rates. But you know, like I said, in March we had a pretty good inflection in terms of orders, which allowed us to get above one because as I mentioned with the back, what we've got modeled in for backlog depletion. We don't need to be above one this year and that's why we're trying to kind of coach everybody into, let's not panic if we don't do above one. We don't need to be above one to hit our numbers. Scott Davis : Yes, that's clear. Okay. I'm going to keep it at that guys. You answered everything else. I appreciate it and best of luck. Richard Tobin : Yes, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Rich, just on that comment on March in terms of the booking rates being better, can you put that in context of these lead time improvements? And what you would expect it to be kind of in the opposite direction. Was that surprise really in these longer cycle or longer lead time businesses where maybe folks were kind of waiting to see what they wanted to do or waiting to see what that supply chain impact was and then came back? Or was it in the more like shorter cycle economically sensitive stuff? Richard Tobin : Both, right. So, you had positive inflection and biopharma that we talked about. I think, retail fueling inflected positively, which is a good sign. But on the longest cycle side, plastics and polymers, which is a long cycle business booked very well. And we expect it to book very well again in Q2. So, it's both I mean, at the end of the day. So -- but we haven't even had the time to dissect it order by order. But I can tell you just in terms of it's not overly short cycle and it's an -- exclusively short cycle, because there is an element of long cycle in there, which you're going to see probably in our backlogs by the time we close Q2. Joshua Pokrzywinski : And then just on climate and sustainability, I think there's some decent mix within mix there. And maybe just to avoid, something like what happened in Pumps & Process. Is there a quarter that you can see coming or a period of time where you would expect, some outsize mix effect to show up or should we just see kind of the steady progression we've seen thus far? Richard Tobin : I think everybody overestimates the margin in Belvac, which is accommodated into our forecast for the full year beginning because as we mentioned. We've been kind of transparent about what the cycle was there. We would expect to see some kind of fade there, but it's not something that we can't mop up because CO2 systems and heat exchanger margins are at minimum flat to what we get in beverage can making. Operator : Thank you. Our final question will come from Brett Linzey with Mizuho Americas. Brett Linzey : First question just on Pumps & Process. Good to see some stabilization there in biopharma. Just curious how we should think about the mixed benefit on the other side here obviously some sequential improvement through the year, but thinking about next year, I mean, we're going to be expanding back into that 32% to 33% level? Richard Tobin : That's pretty aggressive. Look, at the end of the day, as I mentioned, we actually did not give up margin going down. We just gave up the mix effect of that reduced volume on the segment itself. All I can tell you is we would expect on the way back up that from a margin mix point of view, it's clearly positive. And that's why I think that we're sitting, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we're trying our best to get to 30 for the full year, which implies some amount of positive. We know we have the compound positivity, but it implies some amount of growth in the second half of the year at some healthy biopharma margin. But more importantly as we went through in the Investor Day, if we strip out the COVID, the core business is growing 20%. So, if we get some growth in the back end, it's margin accretive and as we roll into '24, if we can keep on that trajectory then it becomes meaningful in terms of absolute profits and margin. But what I don't want to do is to tuck down the growth rates of the rest of the segment from a mix point of view because if they grow significantly themselves and you're going to have a little bit of a margin mix drag, but in absolute profits will take it. Brett Linzey : And then just on Slide 9, you called out the ongoing restructuring actions, I think 14 million in the first quarter. Where are you in terms of right sizing efforts? Do you think you're in a pretty good spot in terms of capacity lined with deliverables? Or is there more to do there? Richard Tobin : In fueling solutions, I think that we're probably 90% there. We've taken a bunch of cost out last year, and then we took some further actions this year. So, the management team is doing a real good job of kind of getting their arms around positioning the cost structure of that business based on what we believe that demand is and the business model is going to be going from here. Having said that, the balance of the portfolio as opportunity in it, and I think if you go back and read the comments, I think I wrote into the fact that we would expect some further footprint actions to go on. And I think you'll begin to see some of that this year. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.",

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director of Investor Relations. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Dickens : Thank you, Shelby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through August 15, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Jack. Let's start on Slide 3. Our results are in line with our internal forecast in the second quarter. Our secular growth exposed businesses that we highlighted at our recent Investor Day outperformed in the quarter with heat exchangers, natural refrigerant systems and polymer processing, all posting growth in excess of 20%.  During the quarter, we incurred operational headwinds from our vehicle service group main production facility as a result of an ERP implementation, which cost us approximately $50 million in revenue and approximately $0.10 of EPS. This one's on me. The business has been doing an excellent job on efficiency actions related to fixed costs, SKU management and vertical integration over the past 18 months, which has been reflected in the margin performance conducting a much-needed ERP upgrade, which is fundamental to our e-commerce ambitions, while finishing a large CapEx project was in retrospect overly ambitious. And I guess I should have known better.  We exited June -- the good news, we exited June with far improved production performance at the site, and we'll try our best to claw back the lost volumes in the second half. We have a constructive outlook for the second half of the year and are narrowing our annual EPS guidance to $8.85 to $9. Since the start of the year, we expected 2023 performance to be weighted to the second half due to post-pandemic destocking across the industrial economy and the gradual recovery in several of our end markets, with the seasonality of second half earnings consistent with what we saw in the pre-pandemic years.  Underlying demand remains good across the portfolio and a significant volume of business is already in the backlog. We proactively intervened on our cost structure starting in the latter half of 2022. And we have continued these structural cost reductions in 2023, driving material earnings benefits. As a result, we are less reliant on top line volume or price cost to achieve our forecast in the second half.  With our solid demand outlook, flexible business model and execution playbook, we are confident in delivering our second half target. We also see a solid foundation building for 2024. A large portion of our portfolio has experienced secular -- or cyclical momentum growth exposures that should persist in a variety of macro conditions and we are proactively adding capacity to ensure we continue to win in these markets.  We also expect solid carryover benefits into 2024 from previously announced cost reduction actions. These organic initiatives, together with a strong acquisition pipeline and meaningful cash flow generation will keep us on track to achieve our long-term growth and value creation goals we set forth in our Investor Day in March.  Let's go to Slide 4. Consolidated organic revenue was down 3% in the quarter despite growth in 3 of the 5 segments due to expected comparable volume declines in several end markets and the aforementioned shipment disruptions in vehicle market, which cost us 2% to the top line. Organic bookings were down 8%, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.92, reflecting better lead times across the portfolio and continued strong shipments against backlogs in our longer cycle and secular growth exposed businesses.  As a result, our backlog continues to normalize, but still remains elevated relative to the pandemic levels. Segment margin was 20.2%, with margin performance preserved despite negative mix and lower volumes due to proactive cost containment actions and lower input costs. We expect the roll forward of these actions together with more normal demand seasonality to drive sequential and comparable operating margin improvement in the second half.  Let's skip to Slide 5, and we'll go through some detailed results on the quarter. Engineered Products was down 8% organically in the quarter. The waste handling business posted a particularly strong quarter, improving chassis availability and aftermarket attachment rates driving solid growth in volumes and new orders. We are presently taking capacity reservations for 2024 and we will be ramping production to meet demand progressively over the balance of the year.  Margins were down 50 basis points year-over-year, principally driven by lower volumes in vehicle aftermarket which offset the robust margin improvement in waste handling. Clean energy and fueling declined 9% on an organic basis as the final quarter of comps impacted the top line and margin mix. Vehicle wash and clean energy were down slightly in the quarter as distribution inventories were brought down in line with the increased cost to carry on higher interest rates. Channel checks indicate that we are now at appropriate levels for expected second half demand.  Margins in the quarter were down 100 basis points on lower volumes and mix, but partially offset by significant cost reduction actions taken in the retail fueling business as we pivot this business to margin and cash flow maximization. Imaging and ID was flat organically on solid growth in our core marketing coating business in Europe and the Americas as well as strong sales in software, serialization. Shipments in Asia were lower. FX remained a negative headwind to absolute revenue and profits in this segment given its large base of non-U.S. dollar revenue.  Margins in Imaging and ID was strong at 23% and improving 40 basis points on pricing and cost controls. Pumps and process was up 1% organically in the quarter, with particular strength in polymer processing equipment, precision components, thermal connectors and hygienic dosing systems. Volumes in industrial pumps was softer due to channel inventory reductions. Operating margin was down due to lower mix of biopharma.  Top line in climate and sustainability technologies were about 4% organically, demand trends remain robust in heat exchanges and CO2 refrigeration systems driven by global investments in sustainability. The segment posted a strong 7% margin in the quarter, up 210 basis points year-over-year on strong volume conversion productivity and positive price cost and mix of products delivered. I'll pass it to Brad from here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm now on Slide 7. The top bridge shows our organic revenue decline of 3%, driven by declines in Engineered Products and Clean Energy & Fueling. Acquisitions contributed 1% to the top line in the quarter, and FX translation was a 1% headwind.  FX headwinds resulted in $0.02 negative EPS impact in the quarter and $0.09 in the first half. Based on year-over-year exchange rates, we expect FX to be an $0.08 tailwind to EPS in the second half of the year. From a geo perspective, the U.S., our largest market, was down 9% in the quarter due to expected lower volumes in the aboveground retail fueling segment as well as lower shipments from vehicle services in North America.  Europe was down 1% and Asia was up 2%. China, which represent about half of our revenue base in Asia was up 5% organically in the quarter. On the bottom chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to normalizing lead times in our shorter-cycle businesses and strong shipments against elevated backlogs in our long cycle and secular growth exposed businesses. Now on to Slide 8, our cash flow statement. Year-to-date, free cash flow came in at $348 million or 8% of revenue and represents an increase of nearly $250 million year-over-year. As discussed previously, with supply chains improving, we have been actively working to liquidate our working capital balances in 2023. We expect that trend to play out in the second half of the year as higher shipment volumes in the third and fourth quarter should result in a reduction of inventory balances between now and the end of the year. This trend is in line with our normal seasonal pattern, as cash flow generation has historically improved in the second half of the year. Our forecast for free cash flow remains on track for between 15% and 17% of revenue. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : All right. Let's go to Slide 9. Here, we show the growth in margin outlook by segment for 2023 that are underpinned in our current time log trends. Our backlog remains elevated across all segments driven primarily by extended backlogs in our longer cycle and secular growth exposed businesses as our lead times continue to normalize and new capacity comes online, we expect these backlogs to continue normalizing through the end of the year.  We expect Engineered products to return to growth in the second half of the year, driven by continued strength in refuse collection vehicles in aerospace and defense. Our waste handling business is fully booked for the year with the possible upside of chassis availability further improves. We expect vehicle aftermarket shipments in North America to recover after the temporary disruption in Q2 and the business should remain relatively stable year-over-year in the back half.  We expect margins to improve in the second half on positive price/cost tailwinds, solid volumes and benefits from our recent productivity capital investments taking hold. In Clean Energy & Fueling, it's expected to return to growth in the second half of the year against easier comparable periods as the end market conditions and channel inventories normalize.  Quoting activity for hydrogen infrastructure components remains robust, and we are working to expand capacity for select products, including vacuum jacketed piping in cryogenic valves. We expect full year margin improvement in Clean Energy & Fueling driven by stronger performance in the second half on volume recovery, improved mix and continued proactive restructuring savings in retail fueling.  Since initiating our fundamental transformation of the retail fueling cost structure last fall, we have initiated or announced $60 million of structural cost reductions in this business. Imaging and ID is expected to continue its stable performance, albeit against tougher comps in the second half, driven by stable outlook in core marketing and coding and serialization. Software full year margins should remain at attractive levels for this segment.  Pumps and process equipment is expected to remain roughly flat organically in the second half. Thermal connectors continued to grow at a double-digit clip with some notable customer wins. Following a record Q2 Precision Components continues to book and ship at robust levels and with a notable mix in business towards energy transition markets, polymer processing is booked for the year.  The biopharma environment is improving with market conditions such as FDA approvals for new promising therapies and recovery in biotech funding and inventory stocking all showing improvement as indicated by our customers who have released results over the past few days. We expect margins in this segment to remain best-in-class levels with performance skewed towards the end of the year on stronger volumes and mix improvements. Order rates and biopharma will be the watch item from here with the potential recovery -- with the potential for this recovery to be a material tailwind into 2024.  Climate and Sustainability Technologies top line trajectory is expected to be steady in the second half of the year. We are operating close to capacity in heat exchanges for heat pumps with incremental capacity coming online over the next several quarters with direct labor at less than 10% of revenue, the conversion on growth in heat exchanges is compelling.  Demand for CO2 refrigeration systems remain solid, and our capacity build-out is on schedule. We are starting to have productive conversations for our door case business with large retailers for their 2024 plans, which is an encouraging indicator of future demand. Beverage can-making is expected to be down as the industry is digesting recent record capacity additions.  We expect continued margin improvement in 2023 on volume conversion, productivity gains and improved mix. Our margin performance in refrigeration has been very encouraging even before the material accretive impact of North American CO2 volume.  Let's go to Slide 10. Here is the confidence we have in the underlying components that drive our forecasted double-digit EPS growth in the second half. We have been vocal about the negative impact of interest costs on channel inventories and have been encouraged that to draw down, while a headwind to the first half revenue has been orderly as end market demand is largely held up.  Recognizing that our markets are not immune to these dynamics, we have proactively enacted cost containment actions to derisk the second half of the year and also provide $40 million of incremental carryover cost savings into 2024 with roughly half the savings coming from retail fueling as part of our strategy to pivot to margin and cash flow maximization of this business. We believe our growth and conversion forecast is achieved based on our revenue visibility and backlog, channel inventory stabilization, secular growth tailwinds and recovery in end markets.  So let's go to Slide 11. We view 2023 as a transition year for our business from a supply chain constrained inflationary high-demand environment of 21 to 22 to a more normalized activity supported by various macro trends. As we move to the second half of the year, the majority of the destocking headwinds behind us and recovery across several end markets we are building solid momentum for 2024.  We are investing meaningfully behind our secular growth exposed end markets to ensure we have sufficient capacity to serve our customers. We are proactively engaging in new product development, often in co-development with our OEM partners to drive product improvement they win share in the marketplace. We believe our biopharma and retail fueling dispenser visits, which were in face with expected market-driven headwinds in 2023, are poised for strong margin accretive recoveries in 2024. All in, we believe at least 40% of our portfolio is experiencing tailwinds that are decoupled from broader industrial production with additional pockets of growth in our market-leading niche industrial franchises. This growth outlook together, the carryover benefit of cost actions into '24, set up a solid foundation for our growth prospects in line with our financial commitments from our Investor Day in March.  So let's move to Slide 12. With our supply chains and operational environment normalizing our forecast for 2023 embedded in a return to pre-pandemic seasonality, the year has played out more or less as we expected thus far with more challenging half of the year now in the rearview mirror. The path from here is straightforward. Underlying demand is solid across our business, and we are confident in our ability to leverage a flexible operating model centralized business systems to drive consolidated growth and margin accretion to achieve our full year guidance.  Our inorganic pipeline remains robust. We remain committed to optimizing our business portfolio and evaluating some interesting options, which we hope to conclude in the second half of the year. That's it for me. I'll turn it back to you, Jack. Jack Dickens : Shelby, you can go to the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question on sort of negative bookings, right, and revenue decline, generally, this destock takes more than 1 quarter, and I appreciate that you do have visibility, but I think versus our model, we were a bit surprised by the revenue. So what gives you confidence that this connection between bookings and destock that this is a 1-quarter event and does not sort of cascade into Q3? Richard Tobin : Yes. I think you have to delink the comments we made about destocking from bookings to a certain extent. So I mean, the bookings number is related to the reduction in the backlog as the backlog slowly deflates and we expect that to continue some. So I wouldn't -- I think we've been pretty vocal about that all year. I think that what has changed in the first half of the year is the realization that the carrying cost of inventory in the channel has gone up exponentially, right?  So if you go take a look at the cost of financing inventory at a distribution level, gone up by 600 or 700 basis points. So I don't think it's unique when a company like Dover says moving into this year that we're going to run for cash and deplete our inventories. I think by and large, everybody was poised to do that. I think that what was underestimated was the short-term negative headwind on the cost to carry.  By doing the -- where we've seen that and where we've done channel checks, we believe that the vast majority of that reduction on the cost to carry is behind us. So we don't have that negative headwind going in the second half of the year, but I wouldn't get all caught up on the bookings side because the bookings are going to be reflective of the backlog decreasing, and I think that they're likely to inflect positive likely in Q4. Andrew Obin : And just maybe looking and follow-up on pumps and process. Can we just go and be getting a lot of questions on that just by verticals, just a little bit more visibility on bookings and revenue visibility into the second half because it is a big focus for investors, particularly the timing of biopharma recovery. Richard Tobin : Yes. Well, I mean, I think that if you go back and read the transcript, I called out that the watch item from here is going to be bookings in biopharma, right? So we've taken a look what our customers are saying. And I think that if you go back and look at the timing, we've been suffering in lack of bookings there as our customers are prepared for the inevitable. Now they're beginning to call the bottom. And I think that we were early in terms of the reduction of inventory. So our expectation is that bookings inflect positive in the second half of the year on biopharma. It's just going to be a question of the quantum.  On the industrial pump side, I think that they suffered a little bit in terms of this channel destocking. Again, we think that that's bottomed now as a reference. And then -- the one that you have that really wags the tail here is going to be polymer processing, where at one point, we almost had two years of bookings in our backlog, and that's just been slowly deflating as we've shipped off that backlog. So I mean, there's moving parts between long cycle and short cycle. The biggest factors going forward from here is clearly going to be on the biopharma side because to the extent that, that inflects positive, I think that we're all cognizant about the margin impact that has on the segment. Andrew Obin : Now this -- your comment on sort of cost of capital and inventories faster than anyone because the entire global supply chain has been floated at no interest rate is going to be fun to watch. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Rich, maybe following up there. You've been, I guess, somewhat cautious on the macro, but you now have a whole slide on Dover strong foundation for '24. So maybe you could overlay your latest thinking on the macro versus that foundation. Would you say in the macro overall is holding up better or worse than you expected. And I know it's early. But given the backlog you have and the additional restructuring benefits for '24, I think you kind of mentioned that '24 could be in line with your sort of longer-term algorithm, which I think is 4% to 6% longer-term growth and 30% incrementals. Does it feel like there's a higher probability of that for '24? Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean if you go back and read the transcript, I think I said that about 4x. We think that we knew we had some kind of secular headwinds between the biopharma side and the EMV roll off, we had that coming. That's part and parcel why I think that we were pretty transparent of what we were going to do to pivot our Fueling Solutions business. And despite having the negative headwind on biopharma, we have preserved our margin in that business. So any incremental volume that we get there should be very attractive. In terms of the total macro, I guess we're happy that demand has held up, right? I mean I think you see part of the negative headwind to some of the destocking because everybody is destocking because they're afraid of the macro to a certain extent.  I think that's been exasperated a little bit by the cost of capital working its way through the system. Where we go from here? I guess we're positioning for a soft landing. Maybe that's optimistic and not generally in our nature around here. But we think the investments that we've made on our growth platforms, as I mentioned in the presentation, are growing at 20-plus percent.  And if we get some recovery on some of the secular headwinds we get, then you can easily go back to what we had laid out as our financial objectives. And you couple that with the fact that we've got a material amount of cost savings that roll from '23 into '24, that's a pretty good start in terms of margin. Andrew Kaplowitz : Rich, that's helpful. And then maybe you can just talk about the puts and takes you're seeing in DCST. Maybe you could -- you talked about maybe some potential incremental weakness in , but the rest of the business seems quite healthy. I think you had the debooking last quarter in door cases, where is that? Do you still expect that in the second half? And so just talk to us about puts and takes of the business because you said overall, it's pretty good. Richard Tobin : Sure. Look, Belvac, it was great while it lasted. So we would expect that to -- it's a cyclical business, CapEx in this space is set to come down. I think that you've got to be careful about what your margin assumptions are in Belvac because we had a lot of engineering project work that was not just equipment-based. So the equipment we make some really healthy margins, but it was diluting. It basically boosted the revenue because we were more of a -- we moved to be more of an integrator. So I think that we can -- while the top line in Belvac was declined, I think that the margin preservation opportunity there is solid. Right now, we're sold out in heat exchanges. If you go back again and look at the transcript here, the leverage on heat exchanges as -- it should be compelling. I mean, labor is 10% of our COGS. So think about it that way about what we need to cover there. Again, we're growing at 20%. I'll leave it up to the HVAC guys to talk about what the growth rates because we see them all over the place around heat pumps, but the fact of the matter is we're in the midst of increasing our capacity somewhere in the order of 40% to 50%, and it's all going to be in place by mid-2024. And so I think that will take care of any worries about what the cyclical decline in Belvac is.  On Refrigeration, we had our highest margin performance ever, at least in my tenure here in June. And that is even before we've ramped capacity at our new plant for CO2, which I think I'm going to go to on Thursday and Friday and see what we're here. We're probably not going to see the benefit of the NAFTA CO2 meaningfully. It's growing at like 80% right now, but it's off a really low base. But our expectation is, is that volume as it comes in is going to be accretive to margins in refrigeration.  So if I couple where we're exiting June in terms of core refrigeration, in terms of margin, and I add on what we expect to be a high-growth platform in CO2, which we've proven we can do in Europe. It looks good so far. So -- and as I mentioned in my comments, we're having at least the conversations right now around core for refrigeration with our clients about demand for 2024. So far, so good. It seems to be quite positive. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Can we just maybe just go back to the ERP issue. And Rich, maybe just talk us through a little bit what happened this quarter? And then it seems like it's largely behind you, but just want to make sure that there aren't any lingering effects in Q3. Richard Tobin : Yes. I've been doing ERP implementations for 30 years, and they never go right. This one went a little bit more wrong than usual. Look, at the end of the day, I mean, I own it, right? I mean we basically put a bunch of CapEx into our main plant in Madison, Indiana. That's not completely done. And at the same time, I think if you recall the presentation we made about this business, we had harmonized our SKUs meaningfully.  And quite frankly, in retrospect, trying to do an ERP when you're doing all that work on the manufacturing floor was misguided on my part. So that was just too much change to move to a new ERP system. At the same time, we have really trouble getting product out the door for the entire quarter, but it was worse at the beginning and we got progressively better as we exited June in terms of our production.  I don't think it's going to be a material headwind from here. I don't think we're completely out of the woods yet, but I don't think it's something that we'll be talking about earnings from here. I mean we do ERP implementations year-round year, and we've been doing them for years. Just I think it's my fault. I think I pushed one on a business that was too much to chew, but we're really excited about the opportunity that we have in e-commerce in this business, and you need a operated ERP to affect that e-commerce change and it kind of blew the plant up. Brad Cerepak : Yes, I'd just echo what Rich said that we exited June at a pace that puts us on track for what we forecast for Q3. And as he said in the script, you can go back and look, we're going to try to recover, but we're not forecasting a recovery of that $50 million. So I think we're being prudent in terms of the way we think about the trajectory of that business in North America. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. No, that's helpful. And obviously, I always appreciate the transparency. My follow-up comment, I guess, would be just around like the business. So the margin profile of the business is trending a little bit lower than you originally expected for the year to kind of think about the second half kind of maybe talk to us about some puts and takes on the margin side, fully recognizing that biopharma is the swing factor. Richard Tobin : Yes. Biopharma is the swing factor. I think we've beaten that one pretty good. And you're going to take a look at what's Sartorius and Danaher and Thermo talk about it. They are much more informed in terms of when the pivot is going to be. I can tell you that. We're prepared in terms of at least operationally when the pivot comes, we're in good shape there.  It's a little bit -- I talked about the fact that industrial pumps was down because of some unexpected destocking. We think that that's sort of done. And then conversely, you've just got the mix effect of polymer processing and precision components did really well and have been doing really well all year, offsetting the negative headwinds in biopharma, but from a mix perspective, it just becomes dilutive to the margin. So weirdly, if they grow faster than expected, the actual consolidated margin comes down, but the absolute profit performance is entirely acceptable because even those 2 businesses are accretive to the consolidated portfolio margin. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Rich, can we just kind of talk about the margin progression a little bit sequentially. So I guess in EP, right, you have about a 200 bps hit on the ERP issue. Just kind of what the trajectory is out of Q2 as you normalize there? And then on DPPS, right, you said margins up in Q4 year-over-year. I guess that implies you're still down year-over-year in Q3. But would you expect sequential improvement in Q3? Or is the margin improvement in DPPS all kind of Q4 weighted? Richard Tobin : Okay. Yes, for DEP, you got it, right? So the margin decline in Q2 is solely on the fact on the VSG volumes coming out. As we move forward from here, you've got the capacity ramp and ESG that comes through, right? So that goose is the top line, and that's let's call that at par margin for DEP. You've got the recovery in VSG. And based on our backlog, we've got increased margin performance in defense just as we ship against the backlog. So that basically gives you the answer for second half margin performance there.  On DPPS, right now, our forecast show a negative headwind for Q3 solely on biopharma. And then our expectation, as I mentioned in the comments, depending on order rates and everything else, is that for Q4, we'll do better based on mix and some recovery on biopharma because it's not as if we're not shipping anything in biopharma. It's just the comparative headwind rolls off by the time we get to Q4. Jeffrey Sprague : Right. And then thinking about price cost, Rich, I assume that's sort of kind of buried in your growth conversion in the bridge. But what's going on with price cost in the back half of the year? Richard Tobin : The price benefit is less in the back half of the year and the cost is based on where we're tracking right now. So we don't basically to make any assumptions in terms of other than leverage. We don't make any assumptions about either positive or negative on the input costs. We'll just see how that develops over the second half. Jeffrey Sprague : Maybe just one last one. I mean the questions I just asked about margins kind of get to Q3 versus Q4. But since we all kind of -- we got a Q2 that you're kind of characterizing is in line with what you expected ex the ERP, but we didn't quite totally get the message, right? So anything else you want to say about Q3 relative to Q4 or just the balance between those 2 would be helpful I think. Richard Tobin : I understand where you're going. All the stick I get about being negative all the time at these conferences and then apparently not negative enough in terms of segmenting the quarters. Look, I think that Q4 is going to be higher than expected. Q3 to Q3 is going to be more or less and in line. But I'd be careful at Q3, again, for the reason I mentioned, right? So you've got the negative biopharma in Q3, which is -- it's not so much a top line issue.  It's more of a margin contribution issue. And then we've got certain businesses that we expect to ship heavy in Q4, which is part and parcel to the end of the depletion of the inventory. So we're not getting into giving out quarterly guidance. I think I would be -- cautious isn't the wrong word. I just think that we're going to have a better Q4 than is likely in models currently. Brad Cerepak : Yes. So it sequentially improves off of Q2 into Q3, but year-over-year, like Rich said, we're looking at a more comparable point on year-over-year. But again, we're expecting margin improvement for the full year for the total company. So therefore, in the fourth quarter. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Charles Tusa : A little bit to Jeff's question on, I guess, from a sales perspective, I guess what I'm struggling a little bit with is the sequential increase. I mean you got to be up sequentially half to half 9%. Got to do, I think, like roughly $4.5 billion, $4.6 billion in the second half and you're trending at 2.1. So I guess I'm just wondering, like, is that -- you're saying that's kind of all just out of backlog effectively. And so you don't need this bookings number to improve very much. Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, like, yes, I don't think that we need the bookings to improve very much because you've got to be really careful about the long-cycle business. I mean, we do segments. And as you know, within the segments, we've got a mix of business. So we're going to have probably a pretty heavy depletion in backlog. Let's talk about DPPS of Maag, right? Maag sold out for the year.  So basically going to ship against that for the balance of the year. So it's going to make the bookings look a little bit negative. Now whether those get offset, we've got a lot of strength in bookings in Precision Components, and we would expect bookings to get better in biopharma, but we'll see whether that is a Q3 phenomenon or a Q4 phenomena.  I would back up for a moment and go take a look at the presentation we made and look at Slide 10 and take a look at what is required in terms of a conversion point of view. And if you take kind of mid 0.30% conversion and you're back into the number on the EPS accretion, that we need in the back half, it's not Herculean, right, because we almost have as much cost restructuring and cost actions is equal to what we need to get in terms of the revenue conversion.  So if we did not have that, I think there would be a little bit of a tough part in terms of the revenue required in the conversion. I think that all the work that we've done starting in the back half of last year has allowed us to be in the position of I don't know how the -- completely how the macro is going to develop. I mean these knuckleheads are going to go and raise interest rates again and that's not helpful. But the reason that we're confident about the back half is we've got almost -- we've got more than half of the required EPS conversion and cost savings that we've already enacted. Charles Tusa : Right. Did you expect -- did you expect bookings -- did you expect bookings to get worse from here sequentially? Or have we kind of bottomed on the bookings now? Richard Tobin : Hard to say. Hard to say. I mean you could have flat bookings in Q3. I mean there's an awareness in the marketplace that production lead times have come. So if our bookings, which are higher than normal, basically backstop our revenue for next year in the vast majority of our portfolio, you really don't need to start ordering until the beginning of Q4.  Now whether we can pull some of that in through market signaling, and that's when we start getting into what are we going to do about pricing in 2024, what are we going to go out to the marketplace and say about SWEP like weirdly, we're sold out in SWEP, but our bookings -- if you looked at our bookings in SWEP, you would think that we have no bookings for Q4 just because that's the dynamic of how that business works.  It's capacity reservation as opposed to bookings. So I wouldn't get excited about bookings. I can tell you factually, we'll ship off the back of Belvac and Maag, which will have a disproportionate negative impact on those 2 segments. The balance of the portfolio, I would presume in the short-cycle side, we're probably bottoming in bookings right now. Charles Tusa : All right. And then just one last one for you, Rich, just philosophically. I mean, the Slide 11 has like 9 different businesses, and that's only 40% of your portfolio. This has always been a bit of a complex portfolio, but the amount of things that you've had to walk through today, the amount of things that have happened in the last couple of quarters, whether it's the $90 million pushout, the ERP in somewhat obscure businesses, albeit pretty good businesses. I think the only people that dislike having to dig into these little $100 million businesses, more than it sounds like you talk about them is us maybe. At what point do you kind of really take a much closer look at this portfolio and just kind of say it's just too complex to kind of run and manage, let alone invest in. I think that's kind of one of the issues here that people are having. Is there just always something moving around. Richard Tobin : Yes. No, I get it, and I will make -- I'll answer it 2 different ways. I think if you go back and look at the transcript, I talked about the portfolio and read what you'd like about that. And I'll make an argument that in 2024, the diversity of our portfolio will outperform certain secular themes that it's going to be an advantage in '24. It may not have been an advantage over the past 18 months just because of the disproportionate negative weight of biopharma, quite frankly. But I'm willing to bet in 2024, all the work we've done and the diversity of our portfolio would be an advantage as opposed to being kind of something that's singular in terms of market exposure that may be easy to understand. Charles Tusa : So can you grow double-digit EPS in '24? . Richard Tobin : Too early to tell. Too early to tell. I think it's going to be dependent on the macro, but I think that I can tell you that where we've invested, we're really excited about what we're getting out of it. And I think there are parts of our portfolio that have had negative headwinds. You can't really see it just because of the individual pieces that are really inflecting the other way. So I know that waste handling is not exciting, but the fact of the matter is that business could be up substantially in . Charles Tusa : All right. The gauntlets lay down. '24 is the year. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Halloran with Baird. Michael Halloran : So the short cycle side of things, just some clarification here. I think basically what you're saying is the sell-out in the channel is actually pretty stable, pretty healthy sell-in because of the inventory destock side of things, that's where the headwind is and the expectations from here for that sellout piece to remain relatively stable. I mean that's a fair characterization. Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean I think that the end market demand has been okay across -- from the distribution side of the portfolio. But sell out, so the sell-out metrics look good. The channel checks that we're getting is basically our distributors saying the cost of capital on our inventory is just getting a bit much to bear here, and we're going to wait because, by the way, we know your lead times are down and we want the product, we can get it from. And look, I get it, right? Everybody is trying to maximize cash flow just because of the cost of carrying that cash flow, including us, by the way. So I don't think that distribution would be unique here. I think the good news is that the end market demand itself has remained pretty good overall. Michael Halloran : Yes, makes sense. And then just on the imaging side of things, it sounds like things are a little bit more sluggish there, just some context and how much entirely just a little bit tightening on the consumer side or any other variables worth mentioning? Richard Tobin : Yes, it's the 1 -- well, 1 or 2 -- we have 2 businesses that have kind of a material exposure to China, and that's one of them. And that is just a reflection mostly of demand to China being quite poor. Operator : We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : And I definitely listen to the exportation to check the transcript. But I wanted to put a finer point on a couple of things. One was just third quarter sales, Rich, are we assuming from what you said about shipping out of backlog in Q4 that sort of third quarter sales are flattish sequentially, and then you'll get this lift in the fourth quarter as the backlog depletes. And with your comments on bookings to be sort of flattish Q3 and then in flex maybe Q4. Were those sort of sequential comments as well? I just wanted to check that, please. Richard Tobin : Yes. Julian, I don't want to be overtly negative about Q3, all right? So Q3 is going to get sequentially better. It's just that proportionally based on where we can see the orders and when they're due to ship that sequentially, Q4 is going to be better than it's been over the last I don't want to go back to 2020, I don't remember, but it's going to go back to the way we looked pre-pandemic, where we shipped pretty heavily in Q4.  And then it just becomes a question of production performance in Q4 and that is going to be dependent on what the order rates look like between Q3 and Q4? And do we have to start building out in Q4 for volume for '24. Now there's going to be some businesses where that's the case. So the businesses that were sold out this year, which is several portions of the portfolio, we're going to start taking orders for '24 relatively soon. We're taking orders and right now in certain parts of the portfolio for that.  So I don't want to be overly negative on Q3. I think the Q3 is going to be a good quarter. But I think the Q4, at least comparably is going to be a better quarter. I think that in terms of the order rates -- it's more of a we'll see. We know we're going to ship off backlog in Q3 pretty heavily. So they may be book-to-bill maybe less than 1. It may not be. And our expectation is that Q4 should be up at least almost by definition comparably. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. And then trying to switch away from bookings and backlog and so on maybe just capital deployment that there hasn't been that much on. You'd mentioned sort of watch this space, I think, on M&A in the coming months. It's been a pretty more abundant M&A environment for 18-plus months. So kind of how do you see that? And then also with the stock where it is, a lot of people view the valuation is undemanding. Kind of what's the appeal on share buybacks given the sort of solid outlook for 2024 that you've talked about? . Richard Tobin : Yes. Our hierarchy remains the same. I think we haven't added anything in terms of our CapEx plans because we've actually had good 3, 4 years of a lot of spending in terms of recapitalizing some portions of our portfolio, and that's in our rearview mirror now. So by and large, our CapEx as a percentage of sales it's coming down this year, and it should continue that trajectory, even if I take into account the CapEx that we're building out on our growth platforms. So that leaves M&A as the second hierarchy. Competition is less than there's not a lot of assets out there, but competition is less. So PE is a bit stopped out right now for the reasons we can understand. So that -- we're looking at some attractive things here, but we're going to keep our discipline in terms of the return. And clearly, if you remember from last year, we get to the midyear, we basically forecast our cash flow as we take a look at our deal pipeline. And if you remember last year, we deployed -- how much was it $0.5 billion? Brad Cerepak : $0.5 billion Richard Tobin : $0.5 billion in an ASR in September of last year. So we've got a Board meeting coming up, and we'll go through all those dynamics again, and we'll decide what to do. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Sorry to beat on this ERP and I will check the transcript in case I missed it. But just, Brad, you said you're not including a recouping of the $50 million that was disrupted this quarter. Does that go into past due? Or did you lose any of those orders? Richard Tobin : You lose the order Deane. A lot of that is sold into distribution and that the product is available, you would lose out of the order. So we'll recoup some of it, but I think that we will not recruit all of it. . Brad Cerepak : Yes. My commentary was more around our view is the back half is not dependent upon recovery of the $50 million. I want to be clear, that's the point really at the end of the day. The team there will try their best. But it is a business that, as Rich says, our customer base stocks these things in distribution and they move out. And if it's not there, they go to the next available competitive unit. So that's the way we see it. Deane Dray : All right. That's really helpful. And then, Brad, in the second half inventory draw down, how much of that is coming just simply from billing orders versus reducing buffer inventory. Are you able to size that? Brad Cerepak : Not explicitly, but I think the way we're working through it is that -- it's mainly driven by, I would say, more towards -- tilted towards the safety stock levels, the buffer inventory and raw materials in the materials flow where what we have to see is less inflow versus production to draw it down. And that's what's happening here in the second quarter. I mean, we did have slightly negative inventory through the first half of the year. But it's a heck of a lot better than it was a year ago, and we're continuing to make progress to make sure production is in excess of the inflows. That's the way we're working it. I think that's it, Jack. Okay. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Are you sure? Do you want to finish it off or should I ask the question? Brad Cerepak : Go ahead. We didn't want to cut you off. Nigel Coe : Yes, don't worry. I'm kidding. Look, so look, we love your macro perspective. You were very early to be cautious and what you so. But it seems like some of the CapEx businesses may be trending a bit weaker. Belvac, Hill PHOENIX. Maybe just some perspective on what you're seeing in those capital businesses. And is it an adjustment to higher rates? Macro uncertainty, what do you think -- how do you think this plays out? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, I think the Belvac is a cyclical business. There was a lot of capital that was put in during the pandemic years into can-making. We did fabulous in terms of market participation there versus our competitors, but we fully expect and have been preparing for over the last 18 months were there be some roll down because you just can't keep at that kind of pace. Now having said that, I don't think it's a negative of a story either just because of the fact that the revenue was a bit influenced by some engineering work that we did at very low margins and while we sold the equipment. And we're actually working on some interesting IP related projects that may help us out to ride the CapEx. On the Refrigeration side, we had that order cancellation that we talked about at the end of last quarter. That was very customer specific. The balance of the demand is decent. I think that there's a little bit of the same frictional costs in terms of labor availability and installation. That's not our problem. It's our customers' problem. The pace of that CapEx tends to be a bit choppy, but the conversations that we're having, and I think it's in the -- in the transcript, the conversations we're having about 2024 in terms of demand in that particular space are good. And I'm just talking about kind of the old traditional case business. Without even getting into natural refrigerants where we're growing at a very heady pace in North America right now off a low base. But based on the conversations that we're having this we feel very excited about where this thing could go. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's helpful. A quick follow-on, if I can. Retail fielding, you mentioned focusing on and obviously, the restructuring actions that speak to that. You've talked about this before, but is this like a double and down of that strategy? Does this become even more of a focus on just cash flow as opposed to growth. Richard Tobin : No. I mean I think we have individual strategies for every business that we have in the portfolio. Obviously, if you go back a couple of years ago, this was EVs are taking over the world and the negative headwinds of EMV plus that the view of what these businesses were worth was, I think, a completely overdone. We think that we've got 20 years of high-margin opportunity into that space. But having said that, we're just repositioning that business where we think that we've upgraded the entire product line globally, by the way, not just in the United States, that we can run that. We can run this business a lot more or a lot more lean than we did in the past, and that's the actions you see us taking. We think we can get that segment to 25%. And you're seeing some of the building blocks working our way there. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Andrey Galiuk, Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrey Galiuk. Please go ahead, sir. Andrey Galiuk : Thank you, Angela. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through November 14, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Okay. Thanks, Andrey. We posted very encouraging results [and let us] become a dynamic operating environment across our different end markets and geographies. Revenue and order rates improved sequentially in the quarter on normalizing lead times and inventories, improving demands across several end markets and a return to normal seasonality. Our backlog continued to normalize in the quarter, in tandem with lead times as we shipped longer-dated orders from our books. Broadly speaking, margins performance in the quarter was exceptional, reaching an all-time high driven by productivity, cost controls and disciplined pricing, which more than offset the negative product mix in Pumps & Process Solutions. The proactive structural cost actions we have undertaken over the last 12 months are paying dividends and should support strong margin conversion going forward. Our recent portfolio moves, the acquisition of FW Murphy and the sale of De-Sta-Co followed the portfolio intent and priorities that we reiterated at our Investor Day earlier in the year and continued our portfolio evolution towards higher-growth and higher-return businesses at attractive valuations. Our balance sheet position and cash flow are strong and provide attractive optionality as we continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions in a more favorable M&A environment and evaluate opportunistic capital return strategies. We have reduced our EPS guidance for the full-year and are now targeting the low-end of the previous guidance range. This is driven by continued lag in biopharma recovery that we expected to happen in the second half of the year. Temporary cost and supply chain issues that I'll expand upon later and a general trend towards inventory liquidation across supply chains as a result of macro uncertainty and prohibitive carrying costs, I'll cover the specifics in the segment commentary. Overall, demand remains good across the portfolio, considering the plentiful negative macro headlines. Our new product launches and capacity additions and identified areas of growth are all on track, and we expect that our fourth quarter production posture will help balance our channel inventories with prevailing demand, lead times and inventory carrying costs by the end of 2023. We are increasingly convinced that inventory position will be critical to the pricing dynamic and financial results moving into 2024. Going into 2024, we expect to see growth in our bookings driven by secular growth exposed in recovering end markets, and we expect to carry an elevated backlog into next year in select businesses. Between our demand outlook, flexible business model and in-flight structural cost actions, we see good foundation for value creation in 2024. Let's move on to the performance highlights on Page 4. Consolidated revenue was down 2% in the quarter despite sequential growth in four out of five segments. Bookings were up sequentially, but down 4% organically year-over-year, resulting in a book-to-bill of 0.93, reflecting better lead times and strong shipments against our longer-dated orders. As a result, our backlog continued to normalize, but remains elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels. Segment margins were up 50 basis points to 21.7%, a record since the Apergy spin as broadly based productivity and portfolio improvements were more than able to offset biopharma mix. Adjusted EPS was up 4% to $2.35 in the quarter. And positive price/cost dynamics, together with cost containment actions, strong execution, more than offset lower volumes. Let's go to Slide 5. Engineered Products was down 3% organically in the quarter. General weakness in Europe and Asia, together with lower shipments in vehicle service, more than offset the record quarter in aerospace and defense and strong shipments in waste hauling. Order rates in the segment were up 12% organically in the quarter, primarily driven by waste handling business, which continues to take capacity reservations well into 2024. Margins at 20% were up 260 basis points year-over-year driven by a better mix of recurring and aftermarket revenue, price/cost and productivity investments made in previous periods. I'd like to mention the announcement of our agreement to divest De-Sta-Co, one of the operating units within the Engineered Products segments and an attractive valuation. This is not related to [indiscernible] performance, but we leave the valuation we achieved underscores the quality and strong performance of the businesses that we have proven to have best-in-class operating margin and less cyclicality than typical capital goods businesses. Clean Energy & Fueling revenue was flat organically in the quarter. We saw double-digit growth in components for LNG and hydrogen markets. And the aboveground retail fueling business returned to growth as post-EMV recovery is in progress. High interest rates led to project push-outs in vehicle wash and an unforecasted channel destocking has resulted in slower activity in LPG components and belowground fueling, which are highly margin accretive to the segment. Margins in the quarter were at 20%, were up 40 basis points on structural cost actions in our retail fueling business and solid execution more than offset negative mix.  Imaging & ID was down 4% organically as slowing demand in China and a difficult comparable period in marking and coding printer shipments more than offset the growth in serialization software and marking and coding consumables and professional services. Margins in Imaging & ID was strong at 26%, though down year-over-year against an all-time record high for the segment in the comparable quarter. Pumps & Process Solutions was down 7% organically in the quarter. Precision components and hygienic dosing systems posted another quarter of excellent growth, but were more than offset by the continued softness in biopharma. Industrial pumps and polymer processing [were stable] in the quarter. Segment margin of 27% was down to the lower mix of biopharma revenue. Topline in Climate & Sustainability Technologies was up 2% organically. CO2 systems continued its double-digit growth trajectory. Heat exchanger shipments remained strong in North America and Europe, though we experienced the beginning of demand headwinds in Asia. The segment posted strong margin performance of 18% in the quarter with our food retail business or refrigeration business operating at a robust 15% margin. The steady margin improvement trajectory in refrigeration has been noteworthy as positive mix and productivity investments have driven excellent margin conversion. We expect the margin improvement trend to continue for the whole segment. I'll pass it on to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. I'm on Slide 7. The top bridge shows our organic revenue decline of 2%. Both acquisitions and FX translation contributed positive 1% to the topline in the quarter. FX, which has been a headwind for the past year and a half resulted in $0.02 of positive EPS impact in the quarter. Based on recent movement in the euro/dollar exchange rate, we now expect FX to be a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind in the fourth quarter. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market was down 7% in the quarter due to lower shipments in vehicle service, biopharma, LPG components and belowground retail fueling. Europe was down 5% and Asia was down 3%. China, which represents about half of our revenue base in Asia, was down 5% organically in the quarter. On the bottom chart, bookings were down year-over-year due to normalization of lead times and strong shipments against elevated backlogs. Now on our cash flow statement, Slide 8. Year-to-date, free cash flow came in at $688 million or 11% of revenue, represented an increase of nearly $400 million year-over-year. As discussed previously, with supply chains improving, we have begun actively working to liquidate our working capital balances in 2023. We accelerated our inventory reduction in the third quarter and expect the trend to continue as we plan to balance our inventory levels by the end of the year. Free cash flow generation has historically peaked in the fourth quarter. And again, we expect strong fourth quarter cash flow to finish the year. Our forecast for 2023 free cash flow is 13% to 15% of revenue. Let me turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : All right. I'm on Slide 9. We expect Engineered Products to generate moderate growth in the fourth quarter. Aerospace and defense should remain strong. Meanwhile, the auto strike will weigh on several businesses in the near-term. Growth in our waste handling business, which is expected to be robust in the fourth quarter into 2024 will be reduced in the near-term by recent strike at a major truck OEM impacting deliveries. Shipments in vehicle aftermarket expected to be lower versus a record previous year on higher interest rates weigh on service shop's ability to finance CapEx. We expect margins to improve in the quarter on positive price/cost tailwinds and benefits from our recent productivity capital investments. Clean Energy & Fueling is expected to remain steady. Clean energy, LNG and hydrogen components should continue their robust trajectory and order trends in aboveground retail fueling point to continued post-EMV recovery. We expect channel destocking and interest rate-driven headwinds in the belowground fueling segment, LPG components and vehicle wash to maintain through year-end. We expect stable margin performance as the $60 million in aggregate structural cost containment actions in retail fueling should offset negative mix from lower belowground and lower car wash volumes. Imaging & ID is expected to be down organically against a difficult comparable period driven by slowing demand in Asia and a subdued outlook for textiles. Serialization software should continue its growth trajectory. Our new customer conversion margin performance should remain at attractive levels at this segment. Pumps & Process is expected to remain roughly flat organically in the fourth quarter. Precision components should continue growth tailwinds from energy transition projects. Polymer processing is booked for the year. The recovery in biopharma components has been very subdued. And although channel inventory levels are now below pre-pandemic levels, end customer demand has not recovered enough to drive 2023 growth despite earlier forecast indicating recovery. We have reduced our production and inventory levels appropriately and will remain in this posture for the balance of the year. This is generally a short-cycle business, and we can ramp as order rates recover in 2024. We expect year-over-year margin headwinds on negative mix in biopharma. And after several years of impressive topline growth, Climate & Sustainability Technologies is expect to moderate in the fourth quarter as demand for heat exchangers abruptly slowed in Q3 due to near-term uncertainty in European heat pumps. As a result, we are reducing production levels to allow for inventory to be cleared in the fourth quarter. Traditional refrigeration demand will retain its seasonality with reduced activity during the holiday season. But we continue to see robust demand for our CO2 refrigeration systems and are ramping up production and go-to-market efforts appropriately. We expect continued year-over-year margin improvement through year-end on productivity gains and improved mix. Going to Slide 10. Our updated EPS guide reflects the near-term changes in demand and our production posture, temporary and isolated issues in the supply chain and costs related to acquisitions, integration and divestment activities. We expect these headwinds to be partially offset by a lower effective tax rate in Q4 as a result of tax reorganization activities driven by upcoming regulatory changes. As I've highlighted, we believe our changed operating and production posture focused on reducing inventories and prioritizing cash flow over volume in reaction to the dynamic operating environment is critical to setting up 2024 outlook where we can maintain and expand operating margins. Let's go to Slide 11 and take a quick look at the inorganic moves that we made during the quarter. Here, we summarized the two recently announced transaction that align well with our portfolio priorities and enhance the overall quality of Dover's portfolio through margin growth and reoccurring revenue uplift, all while reducing our exposure to automotive and China. Importantly, we are able to acquire FW Murphy, a lower valuation multiple than our sale of De-Sta-Co and the after-tax proceeds from the De-Sta-Co sale more than pay for FW Murphy, preserving significant balance sheet capacity for additional capital deployment options. Slide 12 provides more color on the rationale for the acquisition of FW Murphy by our precision components operating unit, which is part of Pumps & Process Solutions segment. FW Murphy brings a highly complementary product offering to our existing position in reciprocating compression industry. FW Murphy Solutions capitalized on the growing adoption of advanced remote monitoring, control real-time optimization solutions as customers seek to reduce costs, improve uptime and lower emissions. In combination with our best-in-class clean technology and our leading position in sealing and valve technology for alternative energy applications, including in hydrogen, the FW Murphy acquisition offers a compelling value proposition into a global industry where we see robust demand from energy transition investments. The FW Murphy acquisition provides a good segue into our next topic, which is to highlight, the recent developments in investment in sustainability-driven markets, starting on Slide 13. There has been plenty of interest around hydrogen as a result of the recent announcement of $7 billion in federal funding for multiple regional hydrogen hubs that are expected to also attract $40 billion in private funding and a roster of blue chip industry participants. Dover has established a position in hydrogen with the 2021 acquisition of Acme, which supplies flow control components for liquid hydrogen and [indiscernible], which offers turnkey hydrogen refueling sites. Additionally, we are organically invested in extending DPCs gas compression components to participate in gaseous hydrogen applications. In short, there is no hydrogen economy without compression. We have great relationships with the industrial gas and hydrogen players and aim to participate throughout the whole value chain through transport and storage through end-use in collaboration with equipment OEMs. We are well positioned to capitalize on growth in hydrogen and industry with a high focus on safety and regulatory compliance with high technological requirements for participation. Moving to Slide 14. The EPA recently finalized its rule under the AIM Act with a deadline for new installation of refrigeration systems to be compliant with lower GWP requirements by January of 2027. We believe this rule is a clear tailwind to our CO2 systems business. And we have had a leading position in the European CO2 market for over a decade where we enjoyed steady double-digit growth trajectory. We were the early mover in transplanting this technology to the U.S. where we currently enjoy technological lead and have the largest installed based and broadest differentiated offering. We have proactively expanded our capacity in addition and in participation of market growth and have been investing behind a platform-based product strategy to drive standardization, thereby reducing costs for ourselves and our customers, improving product quality and simplifying the sales process. Our global CO2 business is approximately $200 million in revenue. The U.S. market is in the early innings, and our business is on track for 30% growth in 2023 with a strong outlook. We are also excited about our new CO2-based heat pump offerings for industrial and district heating applications. It's early days, but we have an active pipeline of orders. And finally, on Slide 15 shows our latest views on heat exchangers since it has become a battleground topic. Our heat exchanger business supplies brazed plate technology, which is currently the most sustainable commercialized heat transfer technology for fluids. We have been the clear beneficiary of the sustainability and climate tailwinds across various applications with a lot of attention drawn recently from our participation as a key supplier to hydronic heat pumps. Heat pumps have emerged in recent years as a technology of choice to decarbonize residential heating, which is responsible for a significant portion of global emissions with hydronic heat pumps as a primary technology to retrofit houses that rely on water-based heating. Legislative initiatives in European Union and individual countries are driving the conversion of fossil fuel boiler with heat pumps. Recent uncertainties about subsidies in select European countries have weighed on near-term volumes, as I indicated earlier. Our exposure across multiple OEMs and geographies, and as such, we are not over-indexed to any product or customer concentration risk. We remain confident about the long-term growth prospects for heat pumps and our technology. It is important to note that European residential heat pumps represent only a quarter of our heat exchanger business. You see several solid growth vectors driven by sustainability tailwinds and continue to share gains from other legacy heat exchanger technologies. We have proactively expanded our capacity as we expect continued robust growth trajectory in heat exchangers, albeit with slightly lower rates in the near-term as various dynamics in Europe slow down. I close my prepared remarks by thanking our global teams for driving our strong financial performance during the quarter. And it's time for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Richard Tobin : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : So I think you were a little more positive in early September than this fourth quarter guidance, understand maybe the world's changed a little bit since then. Maybe you could just discuss that. But then just looking ahead, thinking about perhaps a more cautious view of the world for next year. What's kind of a low-end assumption for next year when it comes to organic and margins? Just to kind of level set us on a case where perhaps the orders don't recouple as strongly to the trend lines or the trend lines are a little bit weaker. Like in your macro view, what is a more cautious outlook for next year bring for Dover? Because you've been talking about growth there as things recouple the trend. It seems like that would have changed over the last month or so. Richard Tobin : Okay. That's a lot to take on this. Steve, let's give it a try. Look, I think if we look at our forecast for the year, we were just wrong about biopharma. I mean, we were getting indications from our customers that there was going to be some nascent recovery. We actually did see some order upticks, but quite frankly, it just never turned into much. So that's a little bit different than we were back in September. I think we just have to throw in the towel on biopharma demand and it gets pushed to 2024. We didn't expect in terms of market dynamics was this UAW on trucks, right? We thought it would stay limited into the car sector. And unfortunately, what we were betting on is being able to ship quite heavily out of ESG in Q4. We'll actually have a good quarter in Q4, but it's not going to be as robust in our plans. I think I mentioned on the heat exchangers. That was a little bit of an abrupt reversal and really didn't happen until almost the end of Q3. So up until about 30 days ago. Everything looked good there. And I think that we've got a little bit of a pivot as what we understand is there's a lot of finished goods in the supply chain that need to be reduced from there. So at the end of the day, I think it slowed some and \u2013 which leads into the next question. And the next question, our positioning now is to drive for cash because I think that the way we're going to be able to protect margins into 2024 is not to be long inventory. We had a lot of discussions around here about incentivizing revenue in 2024 driving revenue, but then you start touching on things like price and you start touching on things like payment terms, and we're not going there. I mean I think that the strategy that we have is to adapt quickly and efficiently to the market demand, bring down our inventory with the hope of \u2013 with the strategy of protecting margin into next year. And I think if you look at how we've handled demand this year, it's exactly what we've done at the end of the day. I mean, we talked about it before. What we had seen over the previous two years was not a lot of unitary demand. You saw a lot of pricing going into the system. So we came into this year saying, there's probably going to be less price and some unitary demand, but the important \u2013 and I think that we've done that in terms of managing, which is reflected in our margins year-to-date, is managing not getting oversupply and over our SKUs a little bit in terms of inventory and that we're going to take that on for next year. Do you want me to make a call on the market next year? I think we're going to have to wait on that. Clearly, there's a lot of headwinds in the system. I don't want to get on a personal soapbox, but the amount of liquidity that's being withdrawn is going to show up somewhere. And this notion that we're all going to wait on the government to bail us out because of this wave of government spending coming, I find that a problematic strategy. So I think it all is going to be triggered by monetary policy between now and the end of the year, which is going to allow for us to predict growth into next year. What I can tell you is, is if we do what we're planning on doing in Q4, we will not be long inventory, and we're not going to get into a situation where if there are kind of topline headwinds that we're going to have to start playing price to drive growth. Steve Tusa : So like should we just think about flat as a starting point for next year? Richard Tobin : No, I don't think so. I think that we're ahead of the curve. Remember, we're a component supplier into end market industries, right? So we're first at the end of the day. So I think that if we get this right, we've got topline growth next year, even in a pretty benign kind of macro environment, I think that we can drive growth. And I think that's part of the reason that we covered some of those growth vectors in terms of our investment at the end of the presentation. Steve Tusa : Great. All right. Thanks a lot. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Sprague : Thank you. Good morning. Hey, Rich, maybe a question on restructuring and thinking fueling in particular. I think you had a lot of restructuring planned there for Q4, but it looks like you're guiding margins kind of flat, I guess, on a year-over-year basis. Could you speak to that? Maybe it's some of the absorption issues you're talking about on inventory, but love some more color on the margin trajectory there? Richard Tobin : Sure. I think if you go back and look at the script, basically, what it says is the restructuring that we took is going to protect margins into Q4 because we actually have a poor mix forecasted for Q4 because where we've been seeing the headwinds in Fueling Solutions is in the below-ground portion of the segment, and that is highly accretive to margins. We're basically \u2013 you heard me answer Steve's question there, we're taking the position of let's allow inventory to be draw down even we would argue at this point, below even normal levels between now and the end of the year and protect production performance into next year. So the restructuring benefit \u2013 the restructuring that we've done is actually protecting margins into Q4. Jeffrey Sprague : And on these questions of just kind of what's at the customer level, right, whether it was biopharma earlier this year, heat pumps, maybe now, some other pockets, how would you kind of square up your visibility and kind of comfort level on understanding what the right level of inventory is or when the customer demand equation might turn a little bit? Richard Tobin : Yes. I think we're getting a lot better at it. At the end of the day, where we sell through distribution, we have visibility, right, because we've just got a material position within distribution, so we can see pretty much stocking levels. At the OEM level, it becomes a lot more difficult. At the end of the day, we're relying on the OEMs to basically tell us their own position. So let's take heat exchangers. Up until 45 days ago, it was still a demand capacity deficit of give us everything you've got and then all of a sudden, for reasons that I tried to cover, the markets come to a halt because there's a recognition of the seemingly is a lot of finished goods in the chain now that need to be bled off. So like I said, from \u2013 if it's distribution, I think that we've got a pretty good handle on it. When it's OEM, we just got to take the signals from them. Jeffrey Sprague : I'm sorry, just a quick one for Brad. Does the tax rate bounce back to 20-something next year? Or what should we expect going forward? Brad Cerepak : Yes, Jeff, the things we're seeing here in Q3 and into Q4 on taxes, will not carry into next year. So said differently, I think our 2024 tax rate is going to be much like we saw earlier in this year when we gave guidance, somewhere in that 20% to 22% rate. Jeffrey Sprague : Right. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. David Ridley-Lane: Good morning. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. Rich, how would you characterize kind of the excess backlog at this point in time, and how that kind of interplays into the revenue you'll see versus kind of the bookings trends that you need? Richard Tobin : I don't think that we have excess backlog anymore. I mean, I think that we're \u2013 by the end of the year, we will have drawn down our longer cycle backlog, particularly in Belvac and MAAG, which drove a lot of it. I think it will end up being a little bit higher than kind of on average in terms of its aggregate, if you go back and look over the last five years, but that is more related to portfolio \u2013 general portfolio mix as opposed to anything else. So like I said, at the end of the year, we think that we'll be in balance between our inventory and our \u2013 either the customer distribution inventory, I would expect the long-cycle business backlogs to be done that reduction to be done by the end of the year. David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then I know it's tough to ask about bookings, but do you see bookings sequentially increasing in the fourth quarter then? Richard Tobin : I got to go back and take a look. I mean, I would say flat. If I think about where bookings are coming from, we got a lot in ESG at high dollar value because quite frankly, we're booking well into 2024 in that particular business just because of supply constraints. Flat, I would call it right now. I think that there's an overall caution with the macro \u2013 everybody recognizes that lead times have been vastly reduced. So I think that there's going to be a lot of hurry for bookings in Q4, but we would expect a pretty large acceleration in Q1, if we\u2019ve got. David Ridley-Lane: Understood. Thank you very much. Richard Tobin : Welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead. Michael Halloran : Hey, good morning everyone. Two here. So first, on the inventory side, you're obviously bringing your inventory down a fair amount pretty aggressively, more so than what we're hearing elsewhere. Do you have the same sense of urgency in the channel when you look at your channel partners? Or do you think they're lagging the pace of your inventory drawdown? Richard Tobin : No. I think that our channel partners are, in certain cases, below normal holding pattern. And that is because of the cost of carry with interest rates. So if you think about a typical distributor that's got $100 million of inventory, a working capital loan that they would have been able to have 18 months ago was probably 2% or 3%. They're probably paying nine now, right? So there's a dynamic now because of higher interest rates of everybody trying to liquidate working capital because of the cost of that working capital, that\u2019s included, by the way. And we're in a little bit of a standoff in certain end markets where we would argue that inventories are down too low, but we are not going to incentivize revenue into the system either through price or through terms. We're just going to sit tight and we'll cut our own production into Q4 because that's just harvesting demand that's in 2024 into 2023. Michael Halloran : So the comment that you made to the previous question about order having a better chance to turn positive in the first quarter, I'm guessing part of it is the comments you just made that inventory flush through the channel essentially normalizes by year-end, and you should have a lease normal throughput, if not a little bit more, given where inventory levels are in certain channels? Richard Tobin : That's correct. I mean, if you look at the topline revenue trajectory in some of our businesses, you have to take destocking into it. That's not a reflection of end market demand. It's end market demand minus destocking. Michael Halloran : Great. And then on the DPPS side, maybe just kind of parse out the moving pieces there. Obviously, you have the continued destock on the biopharm piece, creating some pretty easy comps in the next year, but a lot of your other pieces are a little bit more IP sensitive. So maybe just talk about some of the moving pieces you're seeing on that side. Richard Tobin : Well, I think that overall, it's underestimated, the amount of profit loss that we've had on the biopharma reduction. To the extent that we're clocking at record margins in the quarter, while eating this pretty bad sandwich here, I think that \u2013 quite frankly, I think we're pretty proud of. So to the extent that it's pushed into 2024, at the end of the day, the comps get pretty damn easy once we get into Q1 of next year. The balance of the underlying business, Precision Components, where we basically bought FW Murphy into, look, we're behind energy transition. We're betting on gas in total LNG hydrogen, you name it. Order rates there, we expect to be really good. I think MAAG on plastics and polymers, we've driven down a lot of that backlog. That's probably the one business that's probably going to be weaker next year, but I think it gets completely offset by DPC and by FW Murphy and some amount of bio. Michael Halloran : Great. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Andrew Kaplowitz : Rich, you've talked about being proactive regarding cost set. But if economic conditions stay somewhat difficult, what kind of opportunities do you have to deliver the kind of margins you just delivered in Q3? And then I think you were fearful at the beginning of the year that pricing in industrials might erode a bit. Have you seen any erosion or do you expect any erosion in your markets? Or would you still expect resilient price cost moving forward? Richard Tobin : We're always working on efficiency and structural cost takeout at the end of day. So that's just part and parcel to the business model here. Look, in a dire demand environment, if I point back to how we performed during the COVID period, we\u2019ve got the ability to flex the cost structure, we don't want to, other than kind of productivity and efficiency driven not from a demand point of view. As it relates to pricing, look, I think there was a comment in the script, if you go back and look is that we fundamentally believe that inventory position is going to be incredibly important as it relates to pricing as it goes into 2024. And that's why we're taking a little bit of hard medicine here between now and the end of the year of not to incentivize demand through pricing action, right? We've done a lot of hard work of moving the margins up here, and we're keeping these margins. Andrew Kaplowitz : Helpful, Rich. And then maybe just a little more color into the puts and takes you're seeing in DCST. You mentioned the slowdown in the heat exchangers, but the strength in CO2 systems, you mentioned as well, and you did deliver strong margin. Do you still see DCST as a growth segment for you in 2024? And how would you assess margin potential from here, given what you just report in Q3? Richard Tobin : Look, I think that I think the heat exchanger is temporal, right? I mean, we went through this incredible amount of demand. I don't know if we were clocking up until a month ago, but it was very high demand that we had there. I think this is just a little bit of an inventory clearing thing. So we expect growth out of the heat exchanger business next year. I think that we did our highest margin quarter in refrigeration in the last five years here. We don't think that, that's \u2013 we're going to give back there. Now just recall, though, that Q4, we have to take production down due to seasonality there, all right? So that has some amount of impact on margins. But the trajectory on refrigeration, coupled with CO2, which is margin accretive, we would expect margins to increase there next year. Clearly, we're going to \u2013 that will likely offset the negative input from Belvac, which we expect will run off its backlog next year and have a little bit of a down year in 2024. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate all the color. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joseph Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning guys. Richard Tobin : Joe. Joseph Ritchie : Hey. Just a few quick follow-ups on just the inventory dynamics because, I mean, Rich, you've been doing this a while. It typically \u2013 based on what we've seen, it typically takes longer than a quarter to normalize inventory. And so just any color on your confidence on being able to get inventory where you need it to be by the end of the year? Or is there a good likelihood that some of this kind of spills into 2024? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, when we're talking about total inventory, we're talking about our own inventory, which we're in control of, which is reflected in the cash flow that we're signing up for, right? That takes working capital liquidation, a big chunk of that is inventory. I think if you look at the $600 million of free cash flow during the quarter, a material chunk of that was our own inventory reduction. When we're talking about channel inventory, like I said before, we're \u2013 we've been \u2013 the channel inventory in a lot of our end markets has been coming down progressively over the year. And now we're adopting a posture between now and the end of the year in certain businesses to allow that inventory to clear rather than try to push revenue into either channel inventory or OEM inventory and because the only way you can do that is to start modifying commercial conditions, and we're not doing that. So should it clear, we believe that we're on the front foot here. And so we think we'll be in balance in kind of most of our end markets by the end of the year. And then it just becomes a question of what does growth look like next year and how much confidence there is in the end markets of how much that channel and how quickly they build it back. But we feel good about the trajectory we're on. So that \u2013 it's an end-of-the-year phenomenon based on current demand rates. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just a real quick one on just 4Q in DPPS. So I think you called out flat growth in the segment. So sequentially, revenue is down a little bit. I'm curious just from a margin standpoint, similar revenues \u2013 similar margins for 3Q? How do you think about the margins in 4Q for DPPS? Richard Tobin : They're either \u2013 it will be immaterial up or down, right, subject to mix. Joseph Ritchie : Okay great. Perfect. Thanks guys. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Hey, good morning. Yes. I just wanted to ask a question on the portfolio. I guess as you consider additional pruning, is there a way to maybe quantify what percent of revenue could be under review? And certainly understand M&A is episodic, but are you seeking to find comparable sized acquisitions to offset? Or how should we think about this portfolio shuffle? Richard Tobin : The portfolio \u2013 the whole portfolio is under review all the time. Look, no. Look, we don't go around and say, we've got a business that's got $200 million revenue, let's go buy $100 million to $200 million revenue. No one can orchestrate that. But I think that we've gone over Brett, a lot about where our priorities are. To the extent that we could make a change to our portfolio that we did without touching our balance sheet, I think, is a positive. So to the extent that we could do that repeatedly, that would be great, but that is subject to a lot of timing differences both in and out at the end of the day. But just as an overall comment, what we did this quarter in M&A is what we would like to do progressively every year. Brett Linzey : Got it. Makes sense. Just shifting back to heat exchangers and the destock in Europe and Asia. I guess, does this slow the rollout of some of those capacity additions or change the way you\u2019re at least thinking about the near-term from a capacity standpoint? And then what is your level of visibility there in terms of these imbalances that have maybe skewed more negatively here? Richard Tobin : No, I think the capacity is coming on sequentially. These are highly automated plants. So it's not like we've got to ramp employees. It's \u2013 they're almost blackout plants at the end of the day. So we needed the standing capacity. Remember, heat exchangers is 40% of the revenue. So I get it, it's getting a lot of headlines, and that's why we wanted to address it. Our visibility is, as I mentioned, is not great because it's an OEM sale mostly for us. So up and to the point where they decide they want to slow down, that's what we find out. And the slowdown that we've been called out for the balance of the year manifested itself over the last 45 days or so. So are we worried about the capacity investment? Absolutely not. We think that the technology is fundamental. It's going to grow over time. There's been a massive amount of capacity in heat pumps that's been announced. It always seems a little bit implausible. So I think at the end of the day, the market reset is going to be on the finished goods, not so much on the consumption of the heat exchangers. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. Appreciate the insight. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. One element I just wanted to circle back to in context of the inventory discussion is around the free cash flow margin guide. So I think that it's very high still for this year, but maybe move down a little bit and that's despite the good progress on the inventory liquidation that you cited in Q3. So maybe just any sort of color around the moving parts inside free cash flow, and it has been very volatile. So any sort of thoughts on maybe next 12 months as it's more sort of normalized? Richard Tobin : Well, it's been volatile only because of the amount of demand that it was there. And to meet that demand, you had to basically an expansion of everybody's balance sheet from an inventory point of view. I think that when we put out the guidance for this year, we basically said now that we're in a more normalized market that we were going to bring inventories down. I think we're making really good progress on raw materials. I think by cutting production in Q4, we should clear WIP and finished goods, then it's all about receivables from here to the end of the year. Julian Mitchell : I see. And so receivables was kind of the main delta on the change in the free cash margin guide? Brad Cerepak : Well, it's part of it. But as we went \u2013 if you go back and look at what our commentary has been over the course of the year, we've indicated it's tough to bring inventories down, but we did that in Q3. We see that continuing into Q4. As we look back, and the actual good performance in Q3, receivables, given the timing of sales, actually built in the quarter a bit. So that liquidation is due to come here in the fourth quarter. And I think we'll see very robust cash flow again, based on the commentary that we already provided that fourth quarter is always seasonally strong. But I think given the actions we're taking, it will be even more robust in line with our guide. Richard Tobin : Yes. Between cash flow and the proceeds of the disposal, which we'll receive in Q1, we're in a very healthy cash position. Julian Mitchell : That makes sense. Thank you. And maybe just to follow-up on the question around the sort of the sales outlook. So I think it's very clear and the right thing to do that you're sort of under selling into the channel, if you like, short-term, to make sure channel partners have low inventories entering the new year. When you sort of take that comment plus the improvement in some orders figures you've seen recently, does that make you sort of confident around the revenue growth outlook despite what the backlog has done? And so we should sort of take the low inventories in the channel plus the orders movement, that's a better determinant of sort of sales into early next year than perhaps what the backlog has been doing recently? Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean at the end of the day, everything that's in our control \u2013 for 2024, I think that we're taking the right move. So we discussed managing channel, right, from an inventory point of view. The reason that we highlighted some of the investments, we think that those are growth vectors that those businesses are going to grow despite the macro, right, that they're not subject to kind of general sentiment at the end of the day, or interest rates or anything else just because they've got a demand there. So yes, I mean, look, we're \u2013 knock wood, we're feeling positive about our setup going into 2024 based on how we've managed and will continue to manage 2023. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Good morning, Dan. Deane Dray : Hey. I was hoping to get some color on the retail fueling. It just sounds like there was a bit of a disconnect between below-ground and above-ground, below-ground, seem to be fueling effects of higher rates and maybe some destock, but you weren't seeing that above the ground. But just can you square those, please? Richard Tobin : Sure. We had \u2013 in 2022, we had a great year in below-ground and a bad year in above-ground. So if you think about kind of the time it takes to build sites or refurbishment sites, you had kind of capacity that got built and then they finished the job on the top this year. Belowground now is in a bit of a headwind because of the fact that if you think about like a retailer, a retailer is going to spec in the product that they want at a fueling site and then going to go contract the installation. And part of the problem is it's no longer labor anymore, and it's no a longer product availability. It's the fact that those contractors need working capital loans in order to do these projects and the cost of those loans now is probably quintupled over the last year or so. It was very nice for everybody would be talking about 5%. 5% is a baseline. You're a contractor, you need a working capital loan, you're paying nine or 10. And so that is putting a little bit of a drag in terms of getting that work done, number one. And number two, just a general comment, as I gave the example before, a lot of that underground business, at least the recurring revenue portion of it is sold through distribution, the carrying cost of that inventory has gone up quite a bit, and you basically see almost an over liquidation of inventory in the chain because they know that our lead times are down low, so they're taking their inventory down because they don't want to pay the carrying cost. At some point, that's got to give, and we're not incentivizing through price or terms to push that inventory back into the system. We'll deal with that on the come when we get into 2024. Deane Dray : All right. That's really helpful. And then just a follow-up on the geographies. What were the surprises and maybe you're seeing some of the macro begin to be felt on the U.S. side was down 7%. But what surprised you there? Richard Tobin : I think it's more and more \u2013 look, no one came into this year thinking that Europe was going to be robust. It hasn't been. I think that CO2 systems and heat exchangers are running counter to that argument. CO2 is actually performing quite well. The heat exchanger issue, like I said, up until 45 days ago, you couldn't make enough of them to supply heat pump demand and that just came to quite a halt here I think in a recognition that there's too much inventory in the chain. We were not very hopeful about China, and China has been poor. And I think in the U.S., it's just the general \u2013 what I just answered, I gave you the example a second ago. In the U.S., you can't raise rates at the rate we're doing and not to have knock-on effects in terms of the carrying cost and that's what we're seeing now. Deane Dray : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. So going back to the non-core kind of the portfolio review, I mean, obviously, there's a parlor game about trying to guess which assets might not meet the cuts going forward. But De-Sta-Co wasn't one of those assets. I think already seen as potentially non-core. So I'm just curious given the decent growth, obviously, very good margins, what was it that led that asset to being sold? Richard Tobin : I think that the growth was okay, at least in my tenure here. The end market exposure, both from \u2013 the end market exposure and the geographical exposure, we did not find attractive. Nigel Coe : Too much Europe I assume? Richard Tobin : Too much auto and too much Asia. Nigel Coe : Okay. Too much Asia. Brad Cerepak : Too much China, yes. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then just on buybacks, you did an ASR last year. You've got a fair amount of financing flexibility if you get your free cash flow forecast with the sale as well. I mean, any thoughts on buybacks at these levels? Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean, look, buying back our stock at these levels has become very attractive. I think that we've got a lot of moving parts right here in terms of delivering on the fourth quarter and the cash flow. And then we've got an outbound on the acquisition and an inbound on the disposal. After all that is settled, we'll clearly be in a very healthy balance sheet position. And I'm sure that capital return discussion will come to the forefront. Nigel Coe : Okay. I leave it there. Thanks, guys. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Dickens : Thank you, Angela. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through February 22, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn this call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Jack. Let's start with the key messages on Slide 3. Market demand conditions in the fourth quarter played out largely as we expected. And as we discussed at the end of Q3, we adopted a business posture focused on managing down production in certain product lines to balance channel inventories to the detriment of fixed cost absorption. This puts us in a good inventory position and enable us to match demand and production in 2024. This operating posture also drove solid operating free cash flow performance in the quarter, which positions us to play offense on the capital deployment front in 2024. We capitalized on strong volumes in several markets and drove margin mix higher for the consolidated portfolio in the quarter. The breadth and diversity of our end market exposures, along with proactive cost containment and pricing discipline led to another record high quarterly segment margin in Q4. We remained active on the portfolio front. We improved our portfolio through synergistic bolt-on acquisitions, including two transactions announced in January that add attractive reoccurring and software revenue streams with good growth exposures to our mix. We expect to close the DESTACO sale by the end of the first quarter, which will further enhance our cash position. We entered 2024 in a significantly better financial position than we were 12 months ago. Underlying demand across the majority of the portfolio is solid. Bookings momentum is improving, and we drove the first organic bookings growth in eight quarters. Of note, biopharma book-to-bill was above one, signifying an improving sentiment in the market which is also evident in the recently announced results of some customers and channel partners. While we expect seasonality in idiosyncratic headwinds such as European heat pumps and can-making equipment to weigh on volumes in the first half. Overall, we expect demand conditions to progressively improve off the fourth quarter exit rate through the year. Our recent investments puts us in a very strong position to capture secular growth across numerous end markets like CO2 refrigeration, bioprocessing, data center cooling, electricification of heating and cooling and smart compressor controls. In-flight cost actions provide carryover benefits in 2024 with specific projects to be announced during the year. Lastly, our balance sheet has ample capacity to execute against a strong acquisition pipeline and pursue opportunistic capital return strategies as we continue to upgrade the portfolio over time. Let's go to Slide 4. Consolidated organic revenue was down 3% in the quarter. Bookings were up 2% organically, reflecting growing order rate momentum across much of the portfolio. Segment margin was up 100 basis points to 22% on broad-based productivity and port portfolio improvements. Free cash flow in the quarter was over $450 million or 22% of revenue on improved working capital efficiency and lower CapEx. Adjusted EPS was up 13% to $2.45 per share in the quarter. Our guide for 2024 reflects a constructive outlook. We are guiding for organic revenue growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS of $8.95 to $9.15 [ph] per share, which represents a 5% to 7% year-over-year organic growth, excluding the tax reorganization benefit recognized in the fourth. Let's skip to Slide 5. Engineered Products had a solid quarter driven particularly strong volume growth in conversion and waste handling. Chassis availability improved in the quarter and the business has reservations from large national waste haulers and municipalities well into 2024. Europe and Asia shipments were notably lower in vehicle aftermarket, but bookings improved during the quarter. Margin performance improved 270 basis points on positive mix benefits and volume conversion on recent productivity investments in the waste-hauling business, coupled with a solid performance in Aerospace and Defense. Clean Energy and fueling is our most distribution leverage segment, and as such, is where we intervened aggressively on production to facilitate general channel destocking in below-ground retail fueling, hanging hardware, LPG components and car wash in the quarter. Cryogenic components continued their robust growth and above-ground fueling equipment was up on continued recovery in U.S. dispensers. We believe that our proactive intervention on production in Q4 has allowed excess channel inventory to clear and we expect this business in this segment to return to normal booking and shipping posture in 2024 with normal seasonality levered to quarters 2 and 3. Imaging & ID posted another as projected stable quarter against a difficult comparable period with a high degree of reoccurring revenue, end market and geographic diversity and exposures to growing regulatory requirements for product ID and traceability. This segment remains a consistent performer with strong margins and cash flows. Margin performance in the quarter was exemplary. Pumps & Process Solutions was up organically in the quarter on strong shipments in polymer processing and precision components. The integration of FW Murphy is off to a strong start with a good reception from our customers and notable recent wins of substantial reoccurring revenue contracts in remote monitoring and smart compressor technology. Top line performance and climate and sustainability technologies was impacted by expected volume declines in beverage can making and as well as the recent and abrupt industry slowing in the broader HVAC complex in Europe and Asia, most notably in residential heat pumps, demand - the degree of which was not incorporated in our previous forecast. Margin performance was exceptional in the quarter, driven by improvement in food retail, which posted EBIT margins in excess of 15% in the fourth quarter, traditionally a seasonally slower quarter on positive CO2 product mix and productivity. The food retail team deserves accommodation for their operational achievements to drive significant margin accretion in these past 3 years, but we still have further runway to improve largely on improved product mix. I'll pass it on to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Okay. Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 7. The top bridge shows our organic revenue decline of 3%, with acquisitions and FX translation contributed positive 1% to the top line in the quarter. FX resulted in a $0.01 tailwind in the fourth quarter but remained a $0.06 headwind for the full year, primarily driven by inter-year movements in the euro-dollar exchange rate. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market, was up 2% in the quarter, while Europe was down 16% on lower shipments in retail fueling and HVAC components. All of Asia was up 5%. China, which represents about half of our revenue base in Asia, was up 14% organically in the quarter, driven by large order timing within polymer processing. On the bottom chart, bookings were up year-over-year due to normalization of lead times. Now on Slide 8. We are pleased with our full year free cash flow generation, which came in at $1.1 billion, nearly double the prior year's level on working capital management and lower CapEx. On the working capital front, as previously discussed, we actively work to liquidate our working capital balances in 2023 with a particular focus on inventory reduction in the back half of the year. We believe we have further room to go on working capital improvement in 2024. 2023 CapEx came in lower after reaching a record level of investment in 2022. The step down in CapEx in '23 was less pronounced due to a onetime $14 million opportunistic purchase of real estate within our Heat Exchanger business during 2023. We expect CapEx to further step down into '24. With that, I'm going to turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Okay. I'm on Slide 9. This highlights the results of some recent investments behind several fast-growing platforms and portfolio. A few years ago, these were nascent product lines with about $50 million in combined revenue. We saw a significant growth opportunity in these markets and proactively organically invested in CapEx and R&D to cultivate technological leadership and provide a sufficient foundation for these businesses to win and scale with customers. We are in the early innings of capitalizing on these investments and are excited about their long-term prospects. Across these markets, we enjoy leadership positions with recognized technology and strong relationships with marquee customers. With about $200 million in combined revenue planned for this year and a double-digit long-term growth trajectory, we expect these platforms to become meaningful contributors to Dover's overall growth profile. Slide 10 shows progress against our capital deployment priorities. After several years of elevated capital investments into capacity, productivity and automation projects, we expect capital expenditures to be lower in 2024. We continue seeking high confidence, high return on investment, organic investments, and we'll prioritize those in our capital allocation decisions. Acquisitions remain part and parcel to building a better and stronger Dover. We have been actively shaping our portfolio in line with these priorities and we indicated to investors pulled through at - through additions and subtractions as we work to reshape and enhance the portfolio towards higher growth, higher return and lower cyclicality. Our cash flow position and capital allocation optionality are far superior compared to term [ph] last year. We expect another year of solid free cash flow generation in '24, with the added benefit of sale proceeds from DESTACO should close at the end of February, the beginning of March. We have ample balance sheet capacity to continue improving our portfolio through accretive acquisitions. We're opportunistically return capital to our shareholders. Moving to Slide 11 shows the long-term financial performance of the portfolio. Despite the top line headwinds we experienced in '20 and '23 over the past 5 years, we have grown organic revenue at a 4% annualized rate ahead of GDP and industrial averages. Our margin performance over that period was solid, up 410 basis points in aggregate at a conversion margin in excess of our long-term targets we laid out and primarily driven by operational improvement and product mix. Finally, let's go to Slide 12. Our top line growth in 2024 will be driven by our secular growth exposed end markets, including CO2, data center cooling, heating, electrification and cryogenic components. The near-term outlook for precision components remain strong as demand for infrastructure investment tied to the energy transition is driving increased demand for our compressor components and engineered bearings. Our waste handling business is effectively booked for the year and to continue its double-digit growth trajectory as chassis shortage abates and haulers work to publish - replenish and upgrade their fleets. Based on recent history, we have incorporated appropriate caution in our forecast for biopharma during the year, but we are confident that we will post year-on-year growth in this end market, and we'll update our view as the year progresses. Full year consolidated operating margin is forecasted to improve on volume, product mix and productivity actions. We have done the hard work to get our channel inventories and balance and expect revenue to build off the fourth quarter exit rate with a return to pre-COVID seasonality in several businesses. Our portfolio consists of a collection of businesses that operate in attractive and unique - niche end markets. Our business model is flexible, and we can quickly respond in changes in market dynamics, be the beneficial or detrimental to the business. We have numerous cost control levels and capital allocation optionality at our disposal to deliver on our full year forecast. I'd like to thank our global teams for the efforts to deliver last year's results, and we look forward to serving our customers, partners and investors in the year and ahead. And Jack, let's go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question. Bookings have turned positive, I think, first time in eight quarters. How sustainable is this churn? And how much visibility do you have in bookings staying positive? Richard Tobin : I would expect the bookings stays positive throughout '24 based on our outlook right now. I think that the channel - we've done the hard work on the channel inventory, and that's where we're seeing the inflection in the bookings, whether it be biopharma and that we would expect to see the same in Fueling Solutions. So I don't expect this trend - I don't expect to go negative unless we're going to have an unforeseen recession in 2024. Andrew Obin : That sounds good. And then just a question on biopharma. Do you - just to clarify, do you have any biopharma recovery in the year? Because my understanding is that some of the inventory will become obsolete sometime in the first half of the year. So what is reflected in your guidance and what's not? And I know that it's been tough to call for the past 12 months. So clearly, some degree of caution is warranted. Richard Tobin : It's not a coincidence that we did this call behind some of our customers because we had been in front of them and been wrong. We have very little accretion in earnings on biopharma despite the fact that order rates are beginning to pick up, we'd rather position ourself cautiously. And if you go back and look at the transcript, it said we were just going to update you where we are quarter-by-quarter. So I think that we're going to wait and see what we can say as we do not expect it to be down year-over-year, but we have not incorporated anything - any meaningful amount of operating profit up year-over-year. We'll keep that to ourselves until we see the orders. Andrew Obin : And am I correct in thinking that some of the inventory does become obsolete because it's FDA regulated? Richard Tobin : Yeah. You are absolutely correct. Andrew Obin : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi Group. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Hi, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Richard, Brad, maybe you could give us some more color on how you're thinking about the 1% to 2% organic growth by segment? And then how are you thinking about the cadence of growth in EPS for the year? I know you said you would return to pre-COVID seasonality rich [ph] in a lot of your businesses. But is this year going to be more back-end loaded given the turn in short cycle is happening kind of now? Richard Tobin : I think that it will start slowly. So I think the Q1 will be kind of a roll forward of what we saw in Q4 to a certain extent. But again, you've got some difficult comps. I would expect by Q2 - the vast majority of accretion will occur in Q2s and Q3 as we ramp production into that. And then Q4 - Q4 was actually pretty strong for us. Usually, it's a run for working capital. But again, like every other year, it's going to be highly dependent on production rates that we adopt for Q4. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. That's helpful. And then that you mentioned the intervening in clean energy and that you feel good about where your inventory is now, would you say you generally feel that way across the Dover portfolio? Maybe Heat Pumps is an exception or Heat Exchanges for you guys? And then back to Clean Energy, do you see good demand in that business? Or is it more easier comparisons that should drive it in '24? Richard Tobin : Well, there's a lot of moving parts of what's in Clean Energy. I'd - to back up for a moment. I think that the operating posture that we adopted at-- as we move through Q3 into Q4, was predicated upon of dropping production to flush total channel inventory. And I think that we've accomplished that across the total portfolio. As you mentioned, I think what was not incorporated into our Q4 forecast was the sudden decline in demand on Heat Exchanges for Heat Pumps. Again, like biopharma, I think that we're going to be very cautious about that for '24 until we see the market return. So right now, I think that we're calling Heat Pumps down year-over-year, but I think that, that may prove to be conservative. I think that my own view is it's probably going to flush in Q1 and Q2, and then we'll return to growth on the other side. So overall, outside of Heat Exchangers for Heat Pumps, I think that we're in pretty good shape in terms of balance. And so what's incorporated into the 1 to 3 is basically that's the aggregate of demand that we see. So production demand should be pretty much in balance. So we will probably build some inventory in Q1 as we ramp back up for Q2 and Q3, but that's kind of the way we see it right now. Andrew Kaplowitz : Can you grow DCST with Heat Exchangers down, Rich in '24? Richard Tobin : No, right? Because you've got Belvac rolling down year-over-year, which we've expected for 3 years. If Heat Exchangers stays with our forecast, which is very conservative, the CO2 revenue growth will not offset that, but I think that we're being cautious until we see what happens and when we see what all our customers say about Heat Pump demand for 2024. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful. Thank you. Richard Tobin : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hey, guys. Good morning. Richard Tobin : Hey, Scott. Scott Davis : Hi. Thanks for being brief with your prepared remarks. I really wish everybody would get that memo. It's - it's helpful to get to the [indiscernible] point as I say and get to Q&A and let's all move on. But guys, a couple of things caught my eye. One, kind of the volatility geographically, China up 14%, Europe down 16%. And maybe if you could walk around the world a little bit for us for '24 and expecting a little bit more of a normalization there? Or maybe some puts and takes on some of the geographic moves. I'll just stop there and open it up... Richard Tobin : Sure. Yes. Look, look, I think that the China number is kind of - first of all, China as a percent of our revenue now is, I don't know, 7% or 8%, 6% now, okay, 6%. So that number on the law of small numbers, when we make a big shipment into China out of polymer processing, it swings the numbers. Now the base business that - the remaining base business that we have in China is a reflection of the Chinese economy. It's not great. But it flexed up because of that. Europe is really a couple of things. Well, first of all, the European economy is not great, but it's been exasperated in the quarter by the sudden shift down in demand in heat exchanges or heat pumps where we went from an operating posture of selling absolutely everything we could make to selling hardly anything in about mid-September. So I think there was a market-wide recognition that inventory got over their skis a little bit, so that needs to clear. So what was baked into our forecast next year is I don't think that we're overly optimistic on Chinese demand. I think the European demand in aggregate should improve year-over-year only because of the fact of that idiosyncratic headwind that we had. But the vast majority of the growth that we've got baked into our forecast is North America driven. Scott Davis : Okay. That makes a lot of sense. So Rich, I think you started off - the last couple of quarters, you've made increasingly more kind of tonality, positive remarks on M&A. What - this may be hard to answer, but what does good look like? If '24 is a good year for M&A? Is it to some sort of a range of dollars that you'd like to put to work or some sort of a - something where you guys just have a goal line in mind or that we can start to think about? And that's... Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, look, yes, sure. No, I understand the question. Look, at the end of the day, the reason that we put the one slide together in terms of firepower, it was an odd dynamic coming out of COVID where earnings accretion was great, but there wasn't a lot of cash flow because it was all getting hung up in supply chain and inventory and everything else. So what we expected going into this year was this is the year we've got to generate a bunch of cash. Now we've had ample balance sheet capacity during that time period. So it's not like we haven't been doing M&A because we were waiting to build this cash position. But on the other hand, I think our ability for M&A and capital return is significantly better just on pure cash than it was 12 months ago. So you would expect us to be more active in the deployment. Now we've closed three acquisitions in the last, what, 5 months. We've got a decent pipeline of acquisitions that kind of look like that. Would we like to do something bigger? Sure. But we've got some return hurdles that - if we can't find something with those return hurdles, then we'll return the cash to shareholders. So that's the posture we always adopt. So it's not like we got to go find X amount of M&A every year. We need to find things that are attractive from a return point of view. And if we can't, it's coming back to our shareholder base. Scott Davis : Fair enough. Best of luck this year, guys. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Brad Cerepak : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. Mike Halloran : Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Hey, Mike. Mike Halloran : Just tying everything up, when you think about the year and the idea that things get better through the year for you, how much of that is tied to comps in destocking being behind you versus a fundamental thought process that the underlying demand patterns improve across the numerous businesses you have? Richard Tobin : I don't think that we're getting over our skis in terms of demand. At the end of the day, we've got one to three in top line. Now taking to that one to three is we've got a small amount of dilution because we sold the DESTACO [ph] versus what we brought into the portfolio. I think from an earnings point of view, that neutralized itself, but not from a top line point of view, when I take a look at the math. We've got certain parts of the portfolio that have just done fantastically which would be can-making equipment and polymer processing equipment where are cycling down. So we've known about this coming [ph] and that's why we've been investing in a variety of other portions of the portfolio to cycle up and we're going to take a look that we had a couple of footfalls last year that we don't expect to repeat. So net-net, the underlying growth is higher than one, three because we're incorporating the headwind that we have on some of the cyclical portions of the portfolio, but it's not as if we're baking in this return on just overall GDP growth, I think that what's really baked into our growth is where we have invested. So like what we just try to highlight on that page. I mean, we've taken - we've got a significant amount of revenue growth on three platforms that really didn't exist in the group up until a year ago of any consequence. So the growth is a little bit better than the highlight figure just because of the headwinds we got on the cyclical ones. And it's largely driven on specific products and end market exposure rather than AG, the Fed's going to drop interest rates and GDP is going to expand. Brad Cerepak : Yes. I guess what I would add to that is, unlike like we've been pretty vocal about the fact that price was pretty significant to the top line over the last 2 years that I would say, while it's not a big set of numbers here because of the one to three guide, there is positive volume growth, except for the first quarter as we come down on this idiosyncratic issue that we're talking about. So I think it is a better setup for us this year than years past where you can actually now think about plant absorption, return to volume, not just price. Mike Halloran : Helpful. It makes a lot of sense. And then when you think about the pumps business, the industrial pumps piece, maybe just talk about what you're seeing underneath to put on that side, trajectory, order trends, et cetera, and how you're thinking about that for the year? Richard Tobin : It's decent. It really - the industrial pump side never really had the kind of headwind in terms of stocking and destocking. And that's really high-value equipment. So it's more or less fundamental demand. I think there was some caution in the back half of '23 just because of the carryover of interest rates and everything else. I think what's baked into our forecast this year is some growth, but not anything extraordinary on the industrial side. Brad Cerepak : Right. Mike Halloran : Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it Richard Tobin : Thanks. Yeah. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Richard Tobin : Hi. Brad Cerepak : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : Where are you in the like standoff on price and volume? And what do you assume for price for the year? Richard Tobin : Price is about a point to a point and a half. And on volume, I think... Brad Cerepak : Roughly the same thing. So on 50-50... Richard Tobin : Yes. So a point to a point and a half, and so it's 50-50 on price volume. And I think that we've done the hard work because of what the argument of against price is inventory balances. And I think that the one way you can protect price is not get over your skis in terms of inventory. And I think based on what you see in our cash flow that we've done the hard work for a good setup there. So right now, all we need to do is toggle production with orders at this point. Steve Tusa : How much do you think that production take down in the quarter? Did that impact margins to a degree? Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean you can see it in clean energy for sure. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then lastly, just any kind of more specific color on total margins for the year, whether it's basis point improvement or a hard number for margins? Richard Tobin : How's up for an answer. I know it's so dependent on mix. We'd like to see a quarter or two before we want to put a hard number on it. But I think that by and large, we should mix up this year. Steve Tusa : Sorry, one more for you. EPS seasonality too. How do you see that kind of feathering in over the course of the year? What do you expect in 1Q? And then how does that build? Richard Tobin : Right. I think that Q1 will be more of a reflection of Q4. So I don't get all worked up about the comp. And then we bought - we get the absorption because we ramp from there and then regular seasonality. The vast majority of the accretion in EPS should be Q2 and Q3. And by the time we get to the half year, we'll probably have a good idea of where we stand on Q4. But I think that we put it in all the caution that we can just in terms of the macro, right? This is - our fundamental forecast is basically what we think volume is going to be by vertical here that - so we think that we can hit these numbers. And if we get a better macro or we get biopharma or return on some amount of HVAC that we're ready to go, but we prefer - rather than trying to lead that like we have over the last couple of years and speaking to those end markets, it's more of a show me. It comes, we'll upgrade our forecasting. Brad Cerepak : Yes. And on those two businesses, specifically, we're talking about SWEP [ph] and CPC. When the volume does come, they do convert and the mix is up. So that's the good news. Steve Tusa : Thanks. Thanks a lot. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Hey, guys. Good morning. Richard Tobin : Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey. So Rich, a lot of discussion around your portfolio these days. Just curious what you'd like to share about the potential to unlock value by divesting some of the pieces of the portfolio? Any comments you'd like to share there would be great. Richard Tobin : I mean we're committed to managing the portfolio. I think we sold DESTACO, I think, at a pretty good price in 2023. We've just - we've closed three acquisitions over the last five months where I think are margin accretive and more growth-oriented assets. So I think we'll do the same thing. I think that bigger portfolio moves, you need balance sheet optionality. And I think that if you look at what the knock-on effect of the really good cash flow that we have this past year is our balance sheet optionality is in a really good place. So - which we can be more prosaic about what that means, but at least the building blocks that we need to continue to shape portfolio have improved year-over-year. Let me put it to you that way. Joe Ritchie : Okay. That's helpful. And I missed some of the initial commentary around the guide. I know that there - organically, I think you guys talked about maybe 5% to 7% EPS growth. But just maybe kind of help me understand the low end, the high end, what kind of shapes both of those? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, the headline figure at one to three, you need to take into account that we know where we have cyclical headwinds going forward, right? So we had banked significant profits out of polymer processing and can-making equipment that we knew this headwind was coming. So in that one to three, we're making all that up. We've got a bit of a headwind in terms of the disposal of DESTACO coming out, that the acquisitions, I think on a profit point of view, neutralizes it, but not from a top line point of view. And then I think that we've - unlike previous years where we've kind of led forecasting in terms of biopharma and HVAC components because those are battlegrounds. We've taken a very cautious stance on that, and we're going to wait to see how the market develops. Joe Ritchie : Okay, good enough. Thanks, guys. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, Rich, just back to capital deployment. If I think about what you've laid out in the guide here today, is there any prospective capital deployment on share repurchase or deleveraging or anything like that in the numbers? Richard Tobin : Some, right. Look, if you calculate the EPS accretion on a cautious top line that you'd come with an incremental margin that is pretty high, right? So at the end of the day, what's incorporated in there is a little bit of capital deployment, whether that be in M&A activity or share repurchase. The timing of which we'll let you know when it happens. Jeff Sprague : And then on your Slide 10, right? I mean, you do have two segments that are net negative M&A. I mean, does this kind of inform where we're headed over time? There's gems [ph] in DCST, obviously, like CO2. But should we take that chart at face value on what you're - how you're thinking about reshaping the portfolio? Richard Tobin : Well, that chart actually foots to the chart that we put out in 2020 in terms of the hierarchy of capital allocation to a certain - well, I think the DPPS and DCEF kind of flipped, but that - because you can't control in terms of closing acquisitions. Yes, I mean, overall, yes. I mean if you think that engineered products outside of defense has been an organic issue for us for some time. And DCST, Belvac and SWEP are organic and I think in refrigeration, I think that what we've done with the total investment, that would be an organic play also. So yes, I think that the hierarchy there, they may flip around a little bit, but it's largely correct. Jeff Sprague : Okay. And just on the - back on the orders, Rich, that strengthened process orders in the quarter. Was that all bio or did something else notably pick up in there? Richard Tobin : I think it's broad based, and I think it's more influenced by what do we call them, the thermal connectors. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Richard Tobin : You're welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Morning. Maybe I just wanted to start with the operating margins. So I realize you're not giving a sort of firm-wide number for this year or much segment color. So maybe trying to think about some of the firm-wide drivers of margin this year. So I think there's some positive volume leverage because those are up 1, 1.5 points. Price cost is broadly neutral. M&A and divestment seems maybe neutral, what you've announced so far. So I wondered if those three assumptions were right. And then mix, I guess, anything you'd characterize from all those moving parts sort of biopharma stable, heat pump down, polymer and can down, maybe fueling up, like in aggregate, is there much of a mix impact do you think on margins in your guide? Richard Tobin : Well, you touched on them all, Julian. Yes. I mean, look, we cut production in DCF to manage inventory. So that is not just the lost products that we sell. It's all - and we did it on the underground portion of the business, which is highly margin accretive. So we get that back and it's reflected in Q4, and it's reflected in the year-over-year. So we would expect as we balance production that returns. Engineered Products, really the bulk of the margin accretion in '23 was driven by ESG, but that was more or less back half and we expect a full year of that going into 2024. And if you recall, we had a little bit of a hiccup with an implementation of ERP and VSG last year, which we don't expect to reoccur again. So that's helpful. PII, what do we close at? 25% margins. That's great. So that's more a revenue issue for us. DPPS has had a biopharma headwind now for 2-plus years. What we're calling here it's no longer a headwind and whatever we get on the top side, which we're not baking in a lot right now or hardly anything is going to be accretive. And the DCST has got - right now in our forecast would be margin down on mix because Belvac, which we knew was going to come down and our cautious stance on heat pumps. If we're wrong about being cautious about heat pumps, then that will flex that will - the headwind will be less than we've got modeled into our forecast for the year. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you. And I just wanted to follow up when you were talking about sort of some of the quarterly earnings trends. So do we assume sort of Q1 earnings or EPS is flattish? And then as you said, you get into the meat of the earnings growth in Q2 and Q3? Richard Tobin : Yes, I'm not going to go - it's - Q1 will be more of a reflection of the carryforward of Q4. What we'll get is some amount of production ramp, but a lot of bad comps and then we accelerate right out of there. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Welcome. Operator : The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. We've covered a lot of ground. And Rich, you clearly don't want to give too much cover on margins, but I just wanted to have another crack here. Clearly, margin leverage is a big driver of earnings this year. So maybe just talk about what you baked in for structural cost savings? I know we've got some roll forward from some of the actions you took in '23, but maybe just itemize any other significant cost actions you've taken driving margins in '24? Richard Tobin : Yes. If we go back and look at the transcript, Nigel, we do have carryforward from actions that we took in the back half of the year. We've got some coming. I'm not ready to calendarize it yet because they're not fully baked, but we do have a list of - we do have a list of cost actions, which are more of a revenue hedge. So if we take those actions and we're right on the demand profile, those should actually be accretive to us. So they're not necessarily baked in at this point. And the reason they're not baked in is because we're working on the timing in terms of the execution. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then on pricing, we've been very successful in pushing price. I mean, I think we've all been a little bit nervous about some of the more raw material sensitive businesses, SWEP, Hillphoenix and maybe parts of ESG as well. But it sounds like your customers are forecasting inflation on their components, specifically with the HVAC end market. So just curious what you're seeing in terms of pricing power across the portfolio in '24, specifically within some of these more raw material sensitive end markets? Richard Tobin : Yes, it's interesting. I mean, if you go back and look at our realized pricing, and I'm talking about the portion of the pricing that's fallen all the way to the bottom line, it has not been dramatic for us. And it's a source of consternation around here of what is capable in pricing. And so if we look at some of our end market customers and what they've passed through on pricing, I guess that we've been jealous for lack of better words. So to us, it's been - we've - I don't want to be negative. I think we've taken some price I don't feel that we've got a couple of businesses that have escalation, de-escalation clauses in terms of inputs. I think we've been on the front foot in those businesses of being proactive about locking in our pricing, especially going into this year. So right now, we've actually got a little bit of room if we had to give back pricing, but that's not my expectation. Our issue has always been that the way to defend pricing is not to get over your skis and inventory, and that's why we took it into the neck to a certain extent to kind of manage that position at the end of last year going into kind of the demand environment, at least the setup as we see it today, I think that we feel good about our ability to protect price. Nigel Coe : Right, okay. Thanks. Operator : Our final question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Deane. Deane Dray : Hey. Was there any comments puts or takes on how January started? And just a couple of minutes ago, the ISM January new orders came out at above 50 for the first time, I think, in like 1.5 years, so at 52.5. But any puts and takes from your perspective there? Richard Tobin : You know what, I don't know. So I would expect if it's been terrible, I would have heard something. Usually, when it's positive, no one tells me anything. But - so we haven't even closed the month yet, Deane. So - but I'm unaware of it being worse than what we have baked in. Deane Dray : All right. Good to hear. And then just a quick question. Data center cooling came up a couple of different times. Your heat exchangers play a key role there. Do you have a sense of how that is geared towards air cooling versus liquid cooling because there's a big investment cycle starting, I mean, it's more than 30% growth in liquid cooling side. Will you participate in that? Richard Tobin : It's almost exclusively levered towards liquid cooling. Deane Dray : Yes. And are you not tied to a particular vendor, you'll be - you're a component supplier for that. Is that correct? Richard Tobin : That's correct. Brad Cerepak : Yes. When we say thermal, we need liquid cooling in data centers. Deane Dray : That's great. Richard Tobin : Yeah. But we supply everybody. Deane Dray : Thank you... Brad Cerepak : It's not just heat exchangers, it's connectors, too. Deane Dray : Understood. Brad Cerepak : Yes. Richard Tobin : Got it? Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Dover's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Speaking today are Richard J. Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director, Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Dickens : Thank you, Natalie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through May 16, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Jack. Let's go to Slide 3. First quarter results were in line with our expectations. Strong performance across several of our end markets together with improving order and shipment trends in biopharma components and growth platforms, we're able to offset the counter cyclicality some of our long-cycle portfolio in what was expected to be our toughest comparable quarter this year. It is clear that our operating posture that we took in the second half of 2023 to proactively curtail production has had its intended effect. Customer and channel inventories are now largely in balance with prevailing demand conditions and level set to normalize lead times. As a result, order momentum in the quarter was strong and broad-based, particularly in our shorter-cycle end markets, building off an exit rate from last year and bolstering our confidence full year outlook. We remain active on capital deployment. During the quarter, we closed 2 synergistic bolt-on acquisitions that add attractive digital and reoccurring revenue streams to our retail fueling and carwash platforms. The DE-STA-CO of divestiture closed at the end of March as part of our ongoing portfolio evolution. We also launched a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program at the end of February to return excess capital to our shareholders. Our strong cash flow generation along with the proceeds of the DE-STA-CO sale provide ample capacity for further capital deployment in 2024. We're off to a solid start to the year and the setup for the remainder of the year is encouraging. Our order rate momentum and healthy underlying demand conditions support the outlook for volume and margin improvement as we progress through the year. We are narrowing our full year adjusted EPS guidance towards the higher end of the range, and we'll continue to evaluate our full year targets as the year progresses especially if demand trends continue. Let's go to Slide 4. All-in revenue was up 1% in the quarter. Bookings were up 3% organically year-over-year and up 12% sequentially in the quarter, reflecting growing order rate momentum across much of the portfolio. Of note, after 7 quarters of bookings decline, as a result of the post-COVID backlogs, we have now seen positive bookings growth in 2 straight quarters and expect this positive trend to continue for the rest of the year. Segment margins were 19.7%, down 30 basis points. We expect to return to positive year-over-year accretion from here on mix and volume leverage. Adjusted EPS was up to $1.95 per share in the quarter, and we are guiding 1% to 3% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $9 to $9.15 for the year 2024. So let's move on to Slide 5. Engineered Products had a robust quarter, particularly strong volume growth and conversion waste handling, which set an all-time record for first quarter profits and should continue its positive trajectory on strong truck body order momentum and software adoption. Aerospace and defense also posted double-digit revenue growth. Volumes improved in vehicle aftermarket on better end market conditions and bookings growth, including in Europe. We expect volumes to remain strong for the segment throughout 2024. Margin performance was solid in the quarter on strong volume conversion, price/cost dynamics and productivity investments. Clean Energy and fueling returned to positive organic growth in the quarter after 9 consecutive quarters of flat to negative top line performance driven by the end of the EMV cycle in North America and channel destocking of what is most -- our most heavy distribution exposed segment. Margins were down in the quarter on negative comparable mix, but we expect to see sequential improvement from here and target full year margins up over [ '23 ] driven by attractive volume conversion and the benefits from previously enacted cost control measures. Imaging & Identification posted a steady quarter with lower printer shipments in Europe and the U.S., largely offset by strong volumes in consumables and aftermarket. We expect top line to return to growth next quarter and to be up for the year. Margin performance was exemplary on cost controls and higher mix of consumables and aftermarket shipments. Pumps & Process was up organically in the quarter on robust volumes in polymer processing and precision components. Order rates for thermal connectors were very encouraging. We are pleased to see biopharma shipments grow year-over-year with orders gained further momentum with a book-to-bill of 1.08 as customer inventories continue to normalize and commercial drug production and new therapy development remain robust. I would like to point out that our biopharma business is nearly all consumable and in the post pandemic destocking headwinds dissipate, this is mostly driven by biopharma production volumes, which are growing. Margins in the segment were down modestly due to strong volumes in polymer processing, which was slightly dilutive to the consolidated segment margin. If order trends hold, we expect margins maybe positive sequentially from here. Top line performance in Climate & Sustainability Technologies was down as expected, driven by the expected capital investment slowdown in beverage can making and the impact of destocking of stocking headwinds in the broader HVAC complex, most notably in European residential heat pumps on our brazed plate heat exchanger business. In contrast, our U.S. heat exchanger business continues to grow in double digits on technology share gains in an evolving end market applications, including data centers. We expect top line to improve as the year progresses with easier comparable performance in the second half of the year and supported by strong volume in CO2 refrigeration systems, which drove the bookings growth for the segment on several key customer build-out wins. I'll pass it on to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 7. Top bridge shows our organic revenue decline of 1%. Acquisitions contributed 2% to the top line, while FX was essentially flat. The DE-STA-CO sale, which closed on March 31, will be an offset to acquisition revenue growth beginning in Q2. Total deal costs in the quarter were $3 million or $0.02 of EPS relating to the sale of DE-STA-CO and ongoing deal activity. From a geo perspective, the U.S., our largest market was up 1% in the quarter, while Europe and all of Asia were down 1% and 5%, respectively. China, which represents about half our revenue base in Asia, was up 5% organically in the quarter, with improving conditions across several end markets. On the bottom chart, bookings were up year-over-year and sequentially on strong order momentum as a result of largely normalized channel inventories and lead times. Our cash flow statement is on Slide 8. Free cash flow for the quarter came in at $122 million or 6% of revenue. Q1 comparable performance was impacted by investments in working capital due to the timing of shipments, driving higher receivable balances as well investment in inventory ahead of seasonally stronger quarters in Q2 and Q3. The first quarter is traditionally our lowest cash flow quarter of the year. The change in accrued taxes was driven principally by the recording of future tax payments related to the DE-STA-CO divestiture. We plan to adjust these tax payments out of free cash flow reporting as they are nonoperating in nature in line with the exclusion of the gain on the sale of our adjusted P&L results. Our forecast for 2024 free cash flow remains on track between 13% and 15% of revenue. I'll turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Okay. Before we go to Q&A, I wanted to provide a little bit more color on some of the product lines that helped deliver our results in the last quarter and positioned us to continue growing in the high secular growth rate markets. Early on, we saw a significant growth opportunity in each of these markets and proactively invested in CapEx and R&D to cultivate technological leadership and provide a sufficient foundation to win and scale with our customers. Across these markets, we enjoy leadership positions with strong brand recognition and well-entrenched intellectual property protection. Each of these end markets have enjoyed double-digit growth trajectories over the past 5 years and the robust booking trends in the first quarter point to these markets remaining meaningful contributor to Dover's overall revenue growth profile. In total, these products deliver attractive margin conversion that is accretive to Dover's consolidated margin. In CO2 systems, we were the early mover in transplanting natural refrigerant technology from Europe to the U.S., where we currently enjoy a technological lead and have the largest installed base in food retail applications and the broadest product offering. We have proactively expanded our capacity and invested heavily behind a platform-based product strategy supported by a differentiated digital go-to-market architecture that facilitates the sale and design process, reduces complexity improves product quality and delivers best-in-class lead times and reduces the cost for ourselves and our customers. Our recently launched platforms are gaining traction in the marketplace with several exciting large-scale CO2 conversion programs underway at key retailers with a multiyear runway. We are also benefiting from our exposure to data centers and the secular growth in infrastructure investment with the significant power requirements of next-generation chips that support artificial intelligence. Adoption are now requiring liquid cooling methods. We are exposed to liquid cooling of data centers in both our heat exchanger business, which enables heat transfer within the cooling distribution units and in the connector business, which provides leak free liquid connection points at the server racks and manifolds and now directly to the individual chip cooling cold plates. I'll leave the data center infrastructure and market forecast to our end customers further down the chain. For us, it's clearly an area of robust growth in the foreseeable future as evidenced by our recent order trajectory and high-profile specification wins with the chip OEMs. Importantly, we have proactively installed production capacity and are well positioned to meet any meaningful inflections in demand with industry best lead times. The through-cycle performance of our biopharma components platform has been solid despite the well-chronicled post-COVID destocking headwinds over the past 2 years. With customer inventory levels now normalizing, the long-term tailwinds for single-use bioprocessing and cell and gene therapies are compelling and importantly, our products are specified for a regulated manufacturing environment. While our business is still below peak levels, we believe the recent booking trends and positive tone from our customers and industry partners set up for a potential upside this year. Finally, let's go to Slide 10 shows the long-term performance of our portfolio. Our playbook for earnings accretion remains unchanged to deliver growth through a combination of top line organic growth earnings accretion through operational execution and returns of productive capital deployment strategy. We are pleased with the start of the year with our flexible business model, we will continue to monitor any end market conditions and can quickly respond to changes in the marketplace. And Jack, let's go to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now hear from Mike Halloran with Baird. Michael Halloran : Okay. So a couple of questions here. First on orders. Obviously, comps are easy in the next couple of quarters, but maybe just talk a little bit about the underlying perspective from an end market that gets you comfortable with the order commentary for the year, just kind of the confidence in the composition of where that order growth is going to come from, from an underlying market perspective. And then related, do you see orders up sequentially going into the second quarter? Richard Tobin : Yes, I do. Look, we'd have to go segment by segment because they're different between the short cycle and the longer cycle portions of the portfolio, but orders are up broad-based with the exception of the 2 that we highlighted, both in can making and in heat exchangers in Europe. We would expect that trend to continue, which supports, basically, the seasonality where we expect some pretty big step-up in performance in Q2 and Q3, and we'll see about Q4, which will be a dynamic of how the order rates go between now and then. I think most importantly, our confidence is based on the fact that of all the hard work we did in terms of managing inventory through the channel last year, and that's allowed to us to have more confidence in terms of the order rates going forward. Michael Halloran : Can you just talk to the action-ability of the M&A pipeline from your perspective? Obviously, the commentary has been pretty positive about your flexibility in the short term here. How would you look at that channel as we're sitting here today in the priorities? Richard Tobin : It's loosened for sure. I think there's a recognition now that interest rates are here to stay, that's helpful. I think that the equity markets have rallied quite a bit. So I think that this fear of purchase compression on multiples has gone away. But it's not flood yet, but I think that the activity in terms of opportunities that we can look at is a lot better than it would have been a year ago today. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : So just on the orders comment, I guess, you said SWEP really isn't picking up. Is that a bit of a reflection of kind of the EU heat pump market that that's not really you would expect to see it by now, if you were -- if things were turning up there in the second half. I think you've said that before? Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean we're running out of time here. So our expectation that, that market will be clearly down year-over-year. I think that we've got -- we've brought down even our internal estimates for this year. So I think that's probably the one business that is not tracking to what we thought it would have been. Maybe we're a little optimistic, but we'll see. So we would have to see orders bounce back at the end of Q2 to support any kind of inflection in the marketplace in the second half. C. Stephen Tusa : Right. So like a solid double digit first half to second half, like the way you see orders today, that doesn't sound right. Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean, I have to go back and look at the comps. But if you remember last year... C. Stephen Tusa : I meant sequential, sequential, sequential. Richard Tobin : Yes. Yes, sequential, yes. C. Stephen Tusa : You don't see that as being -- that's not embedded in your current forecast now given you aren't seeing the orders, just making sure. Richard Tobin : That's correct. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then just could you help calibrate us just on an EPS basis for the second quarter? Or however you want to talk about it? I mean it looks like the orders are running right now ahead of the sales forecast that are out there, your orders are going to be up sequentially. So I mean like you look like you're covered from an orders perspective. Any further color on the seasonality of EPS for 2Q? Anything that influences margins in a major way or anything like that because the sales look like they're going to be okay relative to consensus? Richard Tobin : Yes, I don't think that there's any change. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. So what is it usually sequentially or percentage of the year, maybe Brad? Brad Cerepak : I think the normal season [indiscernible]. C. Stephen Tusa : I knew you wouldn't want to answer this. So I'll go to Brad. Richard Tobin : Brad left the room, Steve. Sorry I mean, look I think the seasonality that we would expect is where we're tracking right now. So Q2, Q3 up and then we leave some optionality in Q4, and that will, back to your question about order rates, Q4 will be depending on how we track. So there is potential upside in Q4 if order rates continue to build. Brad Cerepak : Yes. There's a nuance on order rates because DE-STA-CO now out of our order book and Jack can take you through that, but we still see sequential up even covering DE-STA-CO in the second quarter and through the year. C. Stephen Tusa : So like 225-ish for 2Q, does that sound about right? Brad Cerepak : You know we don't give quarterly guidance. Richard Tobin : All right. Any other questions? C. Stephen Tusa : No, no, that's it. I guess I'll ask Jack offline. Operator : And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe I just wanted to start off with the DCST segment. So I think price down a little bit year-on-year. Was that just kind of a mixed thing and then it comes back later in the year. And on the margin front for DCST, 14% first quarter, do we just assume a sort of steady sequential ramp from that point through the year? Richard Tobin : I think it's because of the effect -- the negative effect on the heat exchanger business, which is accretive to that segment. The ramp is going to be very much predicated upon how much CO2 system volume we can get out between now and the end of the year. So I guess, to answer your question, is it will ramp, but you need to take into account when you're looking at comps that until we get into the back half of next year, we're going to be pushing up against the reduced volume and heat exchangers. Julian Mitchell : Got it. And on the pricing, I think it was down just a little bit in Q1. And is there sort of anything to call out there? Does it flip back to positive later in the year? Richard Tobin : Yes, I think that's a nice, to be honest with you. I mean, the pricing that we have out there is relatively hold. It's got to be more mix related than anything else. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, sort of more broadly, when you're looking at your customers and then realize there's a breadth of end market exposures. But is it your perspective that for your product that channel partners and your customers, the sort of inventories are pretty lean now for where we are in the year, any concerns around further need for inventory reduction? Or do you think we start to move the other way when you're looking at how your channel partners are behaving based on orders and so forth? Richard Tobin : Yes. The portions of the business that are distribution, we don't see a build. We just see pass-through right now. So one would hope that we get a little bit of build, but that will be dependent on what we see on pull-through demand from here. So we've talked about this quite a bit, Julian. I mean we did a lot of work and took proactive work in the second half of the year. Our distribution channel checks don't show build, we just see pass-through right now. So it's not going to be a headwind. Hopefully, if demand continues to inflect positively, there will be a little bit of a tailwind. Operator : Our next question comes from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : I wanted to come back to biopharma. You noted some potential upside moving through the year. It does sound like customer tone has improved there. Maybe you could just talk about some of the warranty expirations and some of the obsolescence of some of that single-use channel inventory that could be a multiplier effect for that business. Richard Tobin : It's all done now, right? If you went back and look sequentially at the biopharma business where shipments are heavy, that where we've lapped kind of that 2.5-, 3-year time line now. So there's still pockets of inventory out there and the system builds are relatively a headwind right now, but on kind of the processing side of the business is what is inflecting forward. So we expect orders to be up from here just because of the fact that the inventory has been cleared one way or another over the last 36 months. Brett Linzey : And then maybe shifting over to thermal connectors, doubling of bookings. What do you think the revenue run rate is in that business by year-end? And I guess, is there any reason why this business and those applications should be growing in line with some of the liquid cooling adoption trends? Richard Tobin : That's what we hope. I think it's -- I'm not going to size it for you right now because of the competitive aspect of the end market. What I can tell you is we feel good about where we are positioned from a spec point of view. I think that we're going to be a little bit of a trailer because we're a subcomponent behind a lot of the build that's going out right now. But what I can also tell you is we have prebuilt the production capacity that if it was to inflect kind of like what we saw in biopharma, we're going to be able to be there with industry-leading lead times. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : And so maybe sticking on that Slide 9, I did actually get a chance to see some of your thermal connectors. Your customers were showing them off the data center world a couple of weeks ago. But my question is really on the CO2 systems. Like Rich, how far long do you think we are in terms of these regulatory tailwinds that's helping this business? And maybe just kind of maybe talk a little bit about what the path from here? Richard Tobin : Okay. We are shipping our first platform. We're going to be launching our second platform in the next couple of months. And then sequentially, after that, the third platform will be launched after that. What we have right now is early adopters. So there are certain retail clients that because of ESG reasons and a variety of other reasons, have chosen to be an early adopter in the space and not wait for the regulatory aspect of it. And then we've got a lot of customers that are buying individual units to test them out. So I think we're in the early innings here, but we like the trajectory. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. Cool. No, that's great to hear. And then -- and I know, look, you guys have referenced this biopharma, it seems like we're starting to see some green shoots here. I'm just curious, as you're kind of thinking through the margin trajectory for that business going forward? Maybe just kind of help us with the path from here? Richard Tobin : It's mix, Joe. So as the revenue climbs, the margin mix is important to the segment. And a way to look at it, frankly, is to go look back a couple of years at the margin that we were at and what we actually didn't decline that much in consolidation because the balance of the segment portfolio actually performed quite well. So I wouldn't think about it in terms of incremental leverage on a unit basis. I would look at it more as the revenue climbs, the segment mixes up from there. Joseph Ritchie : Yes. And maybe just a quick follow-up there. So are we at a bottom then in margins for that business you expect it to improve from here sequentially if any... Richard Tobin : We never really gave up any margin in the business. What we gave up was volume. So like I said, it's not a business that you would look at decremental and incremental margins. It's just mix up, mix down as a proportion of revenue. Operator : And our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Maybe just thinking about the segment level organic growth versus your own expectations. It seems relatively clear that DEP should continue to be Dover's best growth in '24 and DCST is the weakest. But if you look at the other segments, how are you thinking about growth versus that 1% to 3% guide for the company? And were there any surprises versus your own expectations in Q1? Richard Tobin : Okay. Let me think about it. I think that, as I mentioned earlier, the only business that is performing worse than what was baked into our original forecast is the heat exchanger business in Europe for heat pumps, which is about -- on a last year basis, it is about 30% of our revenue. So we're going to have to mop up some of that. Now what we have offsetting that is CO2, right? And so I just answered Joe's questions about the trajectory in the market and to the extent that the demand continues to be solid, we should be able to mop up some of that decline. And Belvac was always baked into our forecast. So we don't think that we will post top line growth in that particular segment until Belvac just basically bottoms from there. And then we'd expect to inflect positively, hopefully, in Q4, depending on CO2 demand. The balance of the businesses are tracking by and large, exactly where we had forecasted. So they're really going into the quarter because I think I mentioned that when we did the full year results, it was all about order momentum and so far, so good. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful. And then, Rich, maybe just on DCEF. Can you give us a little more color into the comment you made about margin up for the year after that Q1 start. I know you do have that cost out programs, so how does that flow in through the year and help you get to where you want to be? Richard Tobin : Look, I mean, I think from a margin heavy lifting point of view, I think that's where we've got to do the most work. I think the management team is on it. So you've seen us take some structural cost out of that business. What you need to understand is that business is from a proportion point of view, the one that's most exposed to distribution, right? So it's had a pretty good headwind during the, let's call it, the destocking phase of 2023. So it should run that was a business that we can look to that says, okay, incremental margin should be positive as volume flexes upward. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. David Ridley-Lane: This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. A little bit of a bigger picture question here. So you're seeing broad-based orders improvement, manufacturing PMI back above 50. If you had to take a cut at looking back, right, was there actual underlying demand weakness last year? Or was it all just destocking and a function of comps i.e., do you think the underlying trend is getting -- demand trend is getting better now? Richard Tobin : The demand trend is getting better now because of the headwind from destocking in the previous comps. And then after that, then you get to idiosyncratic product lines and business and geographies, but if you want a macro comment, right? And I think that we addressed it last year is even if you look back 2 years, unitary demand was relatively flat, right? There was a lot of pricing flowing through the marketplace, but the unitary demand was relatively flat. And then because of interest rates, you had a negative headwind last year in terms of destocking. So going into this year, you're thinking positively, let's say, that we'll see about unitary demand year-over-year, whether it inflects up, but what we know categorically is that you don't have the headwind from destocking them, right, because it's just pass-through. David Ridley-Lane: And then just a quick housekeeping question. What is the share count and effective tax rate assumption embedded in the 2024 EPS guide? Richard Tobin : You can call Jack about that. Let's not get into -- I'm not going to page through all these stock units. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Rich, you would -- you addressed kind of your view on what's going on in distribution. Do you have kind of a view on what's going on with the OEM customers? Like if we think about Europe heat pumps, do you know one way or the other, if they actually are sitting on inventory or your product or you're just really kind of waiting for the order for kind of a view of what the underlying demand might be. So heat pumps is the one that kind of stands out, but maybe there's some others where that's kind of a question also. Richard Tobin : They're clearly sitting on our product in inventory. So you've got kind of like you've got the market going down and then you've got inventory with -- because we're a subcomponent with our partners. So we're going to go down first, I guess, is what I'm saying. We went up first as when pull-through demand goes up and everybody kind of puts inventory to allow for their estimates on the builds and now you've got the market turning lower and so that inventory that's out there has got to get depleted. So our expectation is that our demand will inflect up before the end market demand kind of bottoms. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. That makes sense. And then on the liquid cooling stuff, there's a number of competitors and the like, and I don't expect you to name names, but do you have more than 1 or 2 cooling-related customers in this market? And you had also indicated you were specified by the chip OEMs, not to parse words, but I'm just wondering if that was kind of a misspeaking and you're actually specified by the cooling HVAC-related companies. Just curious on that detail. Richard Tobin : I'm not -- it wasn't a misspeaking, but it depends on the chip and it depends on the customer in terms of how without getting into the details about it, you do need to get specified by the chip maker who makes recommendations to the builder, right? So we did the hard work in getting specified at the up end. But clearly, we're going to have to sell into the build channel ultimately will be our customers as those units are built. Jeffrey Sprague : And it's more than more customers than I can count on one hand or now if you are talking... Richard Tobin : Apparently, everybody is in the space, including us. What I can tell you is it's a unique product, number one; and number two, that the production requirements look very much like pharma and that is good for us because we're basically building these products in not the same facility. We've got a dedicated facility for these products, but we're going to run it more or less the way we run our connector business for biopharma. So I think we're in good shape from an IP point of view, and we're in good shape in terms of production capacity. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Guys, you were probably a little bit more skeptical than some of the others in '24 on kind of price and ability to get more price, can we mark-to-market that a little bit here in April? Have you been able to be a little bit more successful with price than perhaps you may have thought? Richard Tobin : I think that we're not going to be negative on price, for sure. I would expect us to be positive to price by the end of the year. I just think that the during supply chain issues and everything else, there was a little bit of solid days in price passing going on. And we weren't the big winners there to be perfectly frank. If you go back and look at our price realization through that period, arguably, we should have taken more. But at the end of the day, to me, that's more of a non headwind going forward because all that capacity got built out if market demand is good, but it's not exactly robust. I don't think there were -- I think that we're positioned appropriately that we're not going to have to give back price because there's been a lot of price take over the last 36 months. Scott Davis : Makes sense. And Rich, totally switching gears, but are you happy with the portfolio you have? It's just -- it's very broad. So there's got to be good and bad. But the opposite of an expensive M&A market is the opportunity to sell things perhaps at above market value. So is there parts of the portfolio that you think makes sense to look at departing with. Richard Tobin : How do I want to answer that? I know that I'm on the clock, right? Could you give me 12 months. DE-STA-CO is a good example, right? That's a business that we looked at in terms of end market exposure and where we had taken it to from a margin point of view, we found a partner, we monetized it, I think, at a multiple that DE-STA-CO not trading within the Dover portfolio, so I think that, that optionality remains on other pieces of the portfolio, but you need to find ruling partners and the like, this is the first part of the question. The second part of the question, Scott, is if we go back to '18, '19 that we said that we were not just going to go around selling stuff around here to dress up margin expansion. That's easy to do at the end of the day, but I don't think it's creating shareholder value. It's just creating optics. We've moved up the margin here substantially right? So I think that unlike '18 and '19, if we were to monetize pieces of the portfolio, we're going to get a lot more than we would have getting back then to the extent that we can find a willing partner there. So I understand that the complexity of the portfolio is a difficult issue from a thematic point of view, but I'm not going to apologize for the value creation of -- that we've been able to extract from the portfolio. So we'll just retain that optionality going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joseph O'Dea: Rich, I wanted to ask about the climate orders in the quarter, pretty notable step up and well above each quarter of 2023, so just trying to understand a little bit more what happened in Q1 versus every quarter of 2023 that brought sort of customers forward. It sounds like what you saw in terms of order levels in Q1 is more of a sustainable level moving forward. So just kind of the catalyst behind that switch from a calendar flip and much stronger demand. Richard Tobin : Well, when you take into account that our orders are dropping in heat exchangers and down -- maybe not down in Belvac because Belvac built that backlog several years ago, but down in heat exchangers, the order rate is exclusively in the fact that we're launching a new product line in CO2 systems. So that's what's different. Joseph O'Dea: But you wouldn't call that lumpy. You're not saying Q1 is like lumpy. It's like there's sustainable demand at that level in Climate. Richard Tobin : Look, I mean they're going to continue well, CO2 is going to continue to offset the heat exchanger business. Now the heat exchanger business has easier comps once we get beyond August because I think that inflected down in September of last year. So it may be a little bit of put and take between now and then because in CO2 systems, we tend to get large orders every once in a while to flex it up and down. But over time, I think that order rates should look good from the half year going forward, for sure. Joseph O'Dea: Got it. And then just circling back to David's question, making sure I kind of understand the takeaway. I mean, it sounds like what you're seeing in order levels is really the reflection of what you see for sell-through demand so that this is sort of working through the end of destock and this is just reflective of sell-through demand. It's not saying that sequentially from, say, 3Q to 4Q to 1Q, the demand environment has really gotten better. It's really just -- this is the absence of the pressure that we saw on channel reductions. Richard Tobin : Right. That's it, right? Because if we go back last year and the decline in revenue that wasn't a reflection of pull-through demand because it had the headwind of destocking. Now what you have is just basically, let's just call it pass-through. So we don't see stocking. We just see it pass it. Operator : Our last question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Can we get on imaging, just the, say, the world in consumer packaged goods, it sounded like that business is beginning to also see some normal demand, but what have you guys has been seeing? Richard Tobin : It's stable, Deane. You have some inflection up and down between the equipment side that the consumable portion is generally a steady eddy. It doesn't flex up or down. You have a little bit of price that goes through every year. I wouldn't be too concerned on quarter-to-quarter movements because they don't tend to be very high at the end of the day, and there's a lot of FX rolling through there just because of the fact that it is truly I think the only real true global business that we have. So it's steady, right? We don't see an inflection up in terms of production rates and consumer products. China seems to be, which was a headwind next year, seems to sequentially be improving. So we'll see from there, but it does run up against a strengthening dollar. Deane Dray : Understood. And then just a couple of cleanup questions on the data center discussions on this call. The first is, I know you've got lots of headaches with SWEP heat exchangers, what about SWEP in data centers in Europe? I know you were highlighting in the U.S., but where's SWEP and data centers in Europe? And then on the connectors are you being asked to bid on these projects for the chip makers? Or are you being is a negotiated design in because that's a big differentiator. Richard Tobin : Let me take the last question first, it's design in. I'm sure that our commercial teams will say it's not that easy. But the fact of the matter is it's designed in predominantly. Now there will be a variety of different negotiations with the participants that are building out the infrastructure, but the most important part, it's kind of win the spec business early on and then we see where we go from there. Data centers in Europe, I'm going to have to get back to you. I don't think it's meaningful. I think that the data center activity that we see is more North American-based. Operator : And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jack Dickens, Senior Director, Investor Relations. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens, please go ahead, sir. Jack Dickens : Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of this call will be available on our website through August 15th, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks, Jack. I'm on Slide 3. Second quarter results were solid, driven by excellent production and shipment performance against our order book. Strong revenue performance was broad-based across our end market and geographic exposures with four out of five segments posting top line growth. Organic revenue was up 5% for the quarter. Bookings were up 16% organically year-over-year, continuing their upward trajectory over the last several quarters and bolstering our confidence in our second half outlook. Margin performance was excellent, up 200 basis points over the prior year to 22.1%, driven by volume leverage, organic and inorganic mix, proactive cost management and rigorous productivity actions. Our strong operational results were complemented by ongoing portfolio evolution actions. Over the last week, we have completed two strategic bolt-on acquisitions, enhancing our clean energy components platform, adding applications in highly attractive end markets, expanding our global reach and strategically expanding our manufacturing base into new regions. We also recently announced the sale of our Environmental Services Group business unit for $2 billion in cash. This transaction, together with the sale of De-Sta-Co in March of this year, reflects our intention to reduce our exposure to capital goods, we have monetized these businesses where we have materially improved operating performance at attractive exit multiples while methodically migrating our portfolio toward higher organic growth and margin opportunities. We are approaching the second half of the year constructively. The underlying end market demand is healthy and is supported by our sustained order rates. We are, therefore, raising our adjusted EPS guidance to $9.05 to $9.20. I'll skip to Slide 4. Engineered Products had another robust quarter, driven particularly strong volume growth and conversion of waste handling and aerospace and defense. Volumes of vehicle aftermarket grew in recovering European market conditions and improved production performance. We expect volumes to remain strong for the segment through 2024. Margin performance was solid in the quarter on strong volume conversion, favorable mix and productivity. Clean energy and fueling was up 2% organically in the quarter on solid volumes in clean energy components where we're starting to see robust quoting activity and order rate momentum from component parts tied to large projects in hydrogen and cryogenic applications. Volumes were also solid in software systems and above-ground retail fueling continued its positive recovery, particularly in the U.S. Margins were flat in the quarter as proactive cost curtailment offset volumes and mix. Imaging and ID posted an excellent quarter on growth in serialization software and strong shipments from marking and coding consumables and aftermarket parts. Printer shipments were still subdued, improved sequentially and should inflect positively in the second half. Margin performance was exemplary on SG&A leverage and a higher mix of consumables and aftermarket shipments. Pumps and Process Solutions was down organically as expected, principally due to lower shipments in our long-cycle polymer processing business partially offsetting these headwinds were significant growth in shipments and new bookings for thermal connectors tied to AI chip liquid cooling applications and data centers as well as a solid quarter in precision components. Both orders and shipments of single-use biopharma components grew sequentially and year-over-year continuing to post-COVID recovery. Margins in the segment were up on mix and operational execution. Top line performance and Climate & Sustainability Technologies outperformed our internal estimates due to an exceptional quarter in food retail which nearly offset the capital investment slowdown in beverage can making an impact of destocking headwinds in the broader HVAC complex, most notably in European residential heat pumps, on our European brazed plate heat exchanger business. We expect these headwinds to persist in the second half, with heat pump-related shipments troughing in the third quarter. Margin performance was exceptional driven particularly by food retail, which posted all-time record margin in the quarter on strong volume conversion and a greater mix of CO2 systems shipments. I'll pass it to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Okay. I'm on Slide 6. The top bridge shows our organic revenue growth of 5% and the De-Sta-Co sale, which was closed on March 31, more than offset acquisition-related revenue of \u2013 by $9 million, while FX was a headwind of approximately $13 million. From a geographic perspective, the U.S., our largest market, was up 11% in the quarter on solid broad-based activity with particular strength in waste handling and food retail. Europe and all of Asia was down 4% and 9%, respectively. China, which represents half our revenue base in Asia was down 8% organically in the quarter, primarily due to shipment timing within polymer processing. On the bottom of the chart, bookings were up year-over-year. Of note, orders were also marginally up sequentially on an organic basis quarter-to-quarter. Below-the-line items negatively impacted our earnings in the quarter, driven by a higher tax rate as well as higher corporate costs net of interest due in part to elevated deal expenses. Now on our cash flow statement, Slide 7. Adjusting for taxes paid on the gain De-Sta-Co, which are non-operational in nature, our free cash flow came in at 10% of revenue in the quarter, up $64 million year-over-year. Year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow is essentially flat versus the prior period despite investments in working capital due to shipment timing driving higher receivable balances as well as investments in inventory due to strong bookings rates. We expect to materially liquidate our working capital balances over the second half of the year and are on track to deliver our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of 13% to 15% of revenue. I'll turn it back to Rich. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks Brad. I am on Slide 8. Here, we provide some visibility into the contribution of the portfolio of both the ESG divestiture and the recently closed acquisitions in clean energy components providers, Marshall Excelsior and Demaco. These transactions continue our purposeful portfolio migration away from capital goods towards higher gross margin, less cyclical and higher growth component businesses, that serve secular, advantaged end markets. We have been methodical and disciplined in our approach to enhancing the portfolio through acquisitions and patient in our strategic divestitures. We are pleased with the valuations of our two recent divestitures within Engineered Products, ESG announced on Monday and De-Sta-Co, which closed in March that both achieved above 13 times trailing EBITDA multiples, significant premiums for capital goods assets. The transaction details are on the page. Due to the timing of the ESG signing and uncertainty of the closing date, we have left ESG in our full year guidance for now. We expect to move ESG discontinued ops in Q3 earnings report, and we'll recast our historical financials and guidance at that time. The ESG earnings profile is shown on the page. And importantly, we are not including any benefit of the transaction proceeds toward value-added capital deployment. We believe we are entering a 12- to 18-month period that represents a unique buying opportunity for attractive assets including many private equity-owned businesses that are overdue for exits in our highest priority areas of inorganic expansion. Our current balance sheet strength and cash flow forecast reinforced by the proceeds of the ESG divestiture positioned us well to remain on the front foot in pursuit of attractive capital deployment opportunities. Let's go to Slide 9. I wanted to provide a little more color on our collection of businesses that provide critical flow control and safety components for industrial gas, cryogenics, natural gas and clean energy applications. These businesses span across both our pumps and process solutions and clean energy and fueling segments, so there is significant commonality in industrial tailwinds and business models. These businesses provide highly engineered components that serve demanding applications in the broader clean energy and industrial gas complexes and there are growing requirements for sustainability, emissions reduction and safety that create favorable product loyalty dynamics and innovation opportunities for us. Our positions in these attractive markets are supported by strong and recognized technological and application expertise and intellectual property with large installed bases that drive reoccurring replacement demand as well as exposure to high growth uses like hydrogen and LNG. We have been active acquirers in the space investing roughly $2 billion over the last several years. We believe these investments should generate mid to high-digit growth at margins accretive to our consolidated portfolio over the long run. This remains a high priority area investment for us moving forward. In light of our recent divestitures, with the scale of this critical component platform now reaching $1 billion of revenue, we intend to readdress our current segment structure in the near future to add focus and disclosures around our growth platforms. Slide 10 provides a little bit more color on Marshall Excelsior, the larger of the two energy businesses that we've acquired in the last week. MEC\u2019s acquisition broadens our portfolio in cryogenic valves and other components and expands our participation in several applications, including the expansion into remote monitoring and digital controls in cryogenic transport and severe duty valves providing an excellent opportunity for cross-selling. Integrating MEC into our existing clean energy platforms and centralized support functions should provide significant cost savings. We expect to capture about $12 million in run rate synergies driving MEC to high 20s margin and high single-digit ROIC by year three. Taking a step back, shows the broad scope of our offering within clean energy applications. We're supplying a variety of safety-critical components like valves, regulators, nozzles, loading arms, dispensing and gas handling equipment for a variety of applications across the high, the whole cryogenic gas value chain from production to consumption. We serve both gas and liquefied gas applications with multiple molecules handled, including LNG, hydrogen propane, oxygen and nitrogen, among others, and we're benefiting from strong investment momentum by industrial gas majors and global government infrastructure spending. While a smaller deal for us, Demaco was also closed last week, providing us a very important European base of manufacturing to enhance our growth and global scale. Finally, on Slide 12 shows the long-term performance of the portfolio. We continued to deliver earnings growth through a combination of top line organic growth, margin improvement through operational execution and returns on productive capital deployment strategies to methodically improve our portfolio over time. Our strong balance sheet position will be further enhanced by the proceeds of the ESG divestiture in the second half of the year. We expect to end the year with approximately $3 billion in capital deployment firepower from cash and reasonable leverage levels. We have a number of levers available to deliver the second half of the flexible business model can quickly respond to changes in our dynamic markets. I'd like to end by thanking ESG President, Pat Carroll and his entire management team for the value they created for Dover shareholders under their tenure. With that, let's go to Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Can you hear me okay? Richard J. Tobin: Hi, good morning. Brad Cerepak : We can here you, Andy. Go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey Rich, maybe you could talk about bookings cadence during the quarter and how you\u2019re thinking about bookings growth going forward? Do you still see book-to-bill over 1 times for the rest of the year? And then as I\u2019m sure you know, short-cycle market seem all over the place at best. So what are you seeing macro-wise? And would you say that Dover\u2019s outperformance is really a result of Dover\u2019s unique exposures versus a lot of macro improvement? Richard J. Tobin: Yes, I would expect it to be over one. As you know, I think that our comps are either in the second half of the year from an order basis. It\u2019s been a little bit lumpy, I have to say, intra-quarter. So we\u2019ll see how it goes, but our expectation is to be over one for the balance of the year. And I think that\u2019s reflected if you take a look at our full year forecast in terms of revenue growth and everything else. The outperformance \u2013 look, I mean, I think at the end of the day, we led in, we led it out, and we\u2019re probably leading in again. So as we\u2019ve discussed previously, I think that our inventory positions are well placed and some of the markets that we have exposure to that have suffered over the previous 24 months or making a turn. We add on top of that some of the growth platforms like we have like thermal connectors and CO2 systems, which are performing very nicely. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I think it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll step away from the rest of our competitors in the macro. I just think it\u2019s unique to our portfolio. Andy Kaplowitz : Maybe just following-up on the last comment, Rich, can you give us a little more color what\u2019s going on in DCST? Obviously, you just mentioned CO2 systems, food retail in general is driving the outperformance. But how is it trending versus your original notifications for the year. Does the strength in food retail actually more than offset the continued weakness in heat exchangers to end up line upside in that segment? Richard J. Tobin: Yes. Look, I think that when Belvac was well known going into the year, and that was part of our plans. I think there was a lot of mixed signals around heat exchangers. I think we\u2019ve done a lot of work there. That\u2019s why I think that we\u2019re pretty confident to call the trough in Q3, and we would expect order rates actually to move up hopefully at the end of Q3, but clearly into Q4. I think on the food retail business, I think that CO2 is doing pretty much as planned, I think that what\u2019s doing better than planned as the margin performance of the business has just been exemplary through the quarter. So that\u2019s why when you look at the consolidated results, I don\u2019t think that we would expected food retail to offset the margin deletion from heat exchangers, but during the quarter, it did, which has been excellent. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go now to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Richard J. Tobin: Hi, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey Rich, just thinking about Slide 11 and everything you\u2019ve kind of here on gas and cryo and everything, you\u2019re characterizing it as kind of a component-driven strategy, and I get that margins are often very, very good in components. But it looks like you\u2019re also stitching it together with some automation and some other things. So maybe just kind of talk about what else, if anything, you need or want to do here as we think about another $3 billion in capital to deploy, is it sort of all in the same ZIP code? Or are there other kind of M&A vectors we\u2019ve got to be thinking about? Richard J. Tobin: Yes. I\u2019m hesitant to say \u2013 well, a couple of things, Jeff. What we\u2019re going to do, whether it\u2019s before the end of the year or very early next year, I think you heard from my comments that we\u2019re intending to re-segment and to give some more visibility here. When we do that, we\u2019re going to make an investor presentation. I\u2019m loath to say what we\u2019re interested in because this area has gotten some intention. So in an area that over the last previous couple of years where we\u2019ve been a buyer. Now we\u2019ve got some competition in this space. So I guess, I\u2019ll take a pass on saying what we\u2019d like to do in the future because I\u2019m not interested in attracting any more interest there. Jeff Sprague : And then one of the things we\u2019ve seen out of Dover though, Rich, also is when you put these stakes in the ground you turn it up organically. I mean with your kind of flow and other competencies here, is there sort of a lot you can do organically to kind of expand your scope here? Or it would be mostly an M&A-driven strategy? Richard J. Tobin: There's two strategies here. I think, as I mentioned in the comments, we believe within 24 months, we can get this entire cluster of businesses, some of which are already performing here, but the entire cluster up into mid-20s EBITDA margin. And that will be through, number one, we think it's a growing area. So we're going to get some volume leverage there. But I think once we put our Dover playbook on back-office integration and all the things that you know about. I think that within 18, 24 months, we can drive the entire segment up there. Jeff Sprague : Okay. And just a quick one on this whole heat pump question. You're talking about Europe, specifically the whole business broadly, the bottom in your business or it's the bottom then your customers' business, that whole kind of lead lag equation, everybody has been trying to sort out? Richard J. Tobin: Yes. Yes. Well, it's unfortunate that we were all never aligned between the components manufacturers of the end market. But the fact of the matter is we \u2013 like I said in the comments, we've spent a lot of time on trying to determine total inventory in the chain. We believe that the \u2013 and it's mostly European heat pumps because that's the vast majority of the volume in the first place. Heat pumps North America and then the balance of the world proportionately is relatively small. So we think that we trough in terms of volume in Q3 and our expectation based on discussions we have our customers, that inventory has been flushed and will go back to positive orders in Q4. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for the color. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks. Operator : We'll go now to Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Richard J. Tobin: Good morning, Steve. Steve Tusa : So as far as the orders are concerned, can you just give us some I missed the first call minutes of the call, so you may have said this, but just some color on how you expect them to trend sequentially? And then should we expect normal seasonality off of that in the fourth quarter? Richard J. Tobin: Look, I think that book-to-bill should remain one or higher for the balance of the year. I think that we have in Q2, I think we actually did a little bit better than I would have expected in terms of production performance and the shipment, and that's why it drove the 5% organic growth, and that's at \u2013 that changes the metric, but I think that order rates we've got a good handle on. I think we stay above one for the balance of the year. Q4 generally is going to be a proxy on everybody's macro outlook of 25. But as I said before, I think that we roll into some easier comps than and something like SWEP should turn positive finally in Q4, if not at the end of the Q3. And I think the momentum that we're going to have in thermal biopharma, the momentum we have in CO2 all will contribute to staying above one. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just in the quarter, I know you guys had said flat sequentially, you were down a little bit. I know that's kind of nitpicking, but what was slower for you guys in that orders, just the one or two things that held that back a bit? Richard J. Tobin: Steve and I have to go through it. I'm sure that somebody took some outsized big orders in Q2 of the previous comparable I'd have to go dig through it. I'll get Jack to follow-up. Jack Dickens : Yes. What we said organically, it was sequentially up marginally. So you got to take into effect the disposition of De-Sta-Co, the acquisition timing within the quarter and also FX, which was higher than we expected in the quarter, Steve. Steve Tusa : Yes, got it. Okay. Makes a lot of sense. Thank you. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks. Operator : We'll go now to Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. Richard J. Tobin: Hi. Andrew Obin : Again, just a question about sort of acquisitions. You're sort of increasing your exposure to green energy. But I think our sense is that at least for now, a lot of these orders are being not orders, just a lot of these projects have been pushed out over regulations. Sort of visibility on taxes, visibility on funding. I mean, clearly, it's an informed bet. And I think in May at our event in New York, we definitely talked about that quotation activity is very, very robust. Can you just sort of talk about what it is you're seeing over the next 12 to 24 months that makes you commit capital to the sector. And to make it clear, we\u2019re quite excited about it, but it does seem that near-term, there are some push outs? Just give us your view because you tend to think about these things? Thank you. Richard J. Tobin: Yes. I mean, Andrew, look, I mean, at the end of the day, you can\u2019t \u2013 when the market is there, it\u2019s too late to buy anything, right? So you need to basically take some bets on what you think has got secular growth behind it. So if we think about thematic at the end of the day, I mean, there\u2019s a whole stream of electrification. We\u2019re not chasing that meaningfully. We\u2019ve had a presence in the gas sector for decades. So we know the customers, we know the regulatory environment around it and everything else. So we\u2019re big believers in the \u2013 the electricity has got to come from somewhere, and we\u2019re big believers that the total gas complex is going to be an important contributor there. What we\u2019re buying are large installed base at the end of the day. So we\u2019re not paying on the comp to a certain extent. But cryogenic components and vacuum jacketed piping were kind of niche businesses in the past, but to the extent that cryogenic gas applications continues to expand, we would expand \u2013 we\u2019re mixed. We\u2019re buying these things and we\u2019re expanding capacity on top of them as we do it. So if we get the timing off a little bit, so be it at the end of the day, I think. But from a secular point of view, we\u2019re pretty confident of what we\u2019re doing. Andrew Obin : All right. Got you. And maybe a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing on DPPS, right? You\u2019re sort of highlighting year-over-year growth in biopharma. And then clearly, I think you\u2019re sort of talking about thermal connections. So what kind of growth can we think about \u2013 just two-part question. What kind of growth can we think about thermal connections? Can this business actually double over the next 12 months? And second on biopharma, when do we actually start growing year-over-year? Thank you. Richard J. Tobin: Well, we should grow year-over-year right this year, considering we probably bottomed in the mid to late of 2023, so that\u2019s good news. And on the thermal, look, it\u2019s a small base, but at the end of the day, our bookings are up significantly, and we would expect total revenue and earnings to be on target to what I think I gave you some numbers at the end of Q2 when we\u2019re tracking that way. I believe the thermal is going to be interesting, right? Because back to your question before between all the hype of everybody talking about it and then the lag period, I think that we\u2019re on the front foot for production capacity. I think that we\u2019ve got clean room production capacity, I think that we\u2019re going to be able to have 100% traceability by the end of the year, which should separate us for a lot of people that are going to try to get into this business. So if I step back at DPPS in total, we knew that Maag was cycled down after a three, four year run coming up. Industrial pumps is, I would call it, not robust right now, but that has been offset by precision components, which is really part of the exposure that we\u2019ve got into the gas complex and the mix effect of both biopharma and thermal connectors. Andrew Obin : Thank you very much. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Good morning, Rich and Brad. Richard J. Tobin: Hey, Scott. Scott Davis : I wanted to go back to, I think, the second relative to Jeff\u2019s question really on Slide 11. Are there channel synergies? Are there synergies that are kind of tangible when you just look at the assets on this page, what \u2013 is it just commonality of end markets? Or are there actually some tangible synergies and benefits of bringing them all together under one segment? Assuming you do get... Richard J. Tobin: Sure. Yes. I mean we bought RegO and Acme at the end of 2021. So Maag basically is an overlap adjacency to that \u2013 to those prior period acquisitions. So it\u2019s just \u2013 think about just adding a bunch of new products under a footprint that we already have. There is a manufacturing footprint opportunity there, clearly, both inbound and reverse synergy on the footprint. These are global businesses. So part of the reason that we did Demaco is you just can't say I'm a North American provider. You have to have \u2013 when you're dealing with companies like Linde, you need to have a European presence. So that's why we purchased Demaco to kind of make our presence in Europe larger at the end of the day. And so what we're kind of building A lot of the times, they're the same customer. A lot of the times, they're adjacencies, but the regulatory and safety requirements to build those kind of components are very common, and it's just an ability that we have. Scott Davis : Okay. And just following up, your bullish M&A comments, I think last quarter was trending in this direction, too. I mean is it a commentary more on asset availability or valuation or both? Richard J. Tobin: More asset availability. I mean, look, we've been hearing about it was supposed to be 2023 [ph] than it was supposed to be 2024 [ph]. And now it's \u2013 we're beginning to see assets coming out of PE, but our expectation is the process is going to accelerate I think everybody has been waiting for an interest rate cut to kind of flex it. I mean the equity markets have been doing relatively well, and that is helpful in terms of not to us in terms of buying, but it's helpful for exit. From a PE point of view. So we've been kind of waiting for this opportunity for a couple of years now, and I think that we're kind of bullish that we'll see if we get them done, right? We're going to not start drawing money around like drunk and sellers, but I think that we're on the front foot of \u2013 we think there's going to be a lot of opportunity going forward. And now with the monetization of ESG, we're a cash buyer. So that puts us in a good spot. Scott Davis : Yes, good luck. Thank you. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks. Operator : We'll hear next from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning all. Just, I just wanted to come back to the ESG divestiture. So you called out the dollar of dilution to adjusted EPS on Slide 8. You've announced a couple of deals here. How are you thinking about the backfill? Do you have line of sight to more than offset with M&A? Or should we think about a balance of repo in M&A? Richard J. Tobin: I think that our bias would be towards M&A. But I think we've got a history of \u2013 we don't sit on cash for a prolonged period of time. The good news now is unlike a couple of years ago, we actually get some yield off our cash. If we rewind the clock back cash three years ago, you've got nothing for it. So yields right now on cash balances, let's just call it, 5% or so. that's not bad. So we can be a little bit more patient, if you will. And if you heard me answer the last question, we think there's going to be a lot of M&A opportunity coming forward. So, I think our bias is probably a lot more towards M&A than share repurchase than it's been over the previous three years to four years. Brett Linzey : Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on free cash flow. So thinking about the composition of ESG out, some of these more recurring businesses into the mix. How should we think about free cash flow margin as you evolve the portfolio and you're buying more recurring cash flow? Richard J. Tobin: Well, I mean, like the ESG actually from a working capital point of view is a pretty good performer. But \u2013 so the benefit would be on the gross margin, right? So what we're bringing in gross margin up, so profitability up. So the like-for-like swap of dollar of revenue should be better from the cash\u2026 Brad Cerepak : Should be better, yes. Brett Linzey : Great. Good quarter. Thanks. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks. Operator : Next, we'll hear from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. One segment that doesn't get a little airtime is DII, but it had a very impressive bookings, organic sales growth, margin performance in Q2. And I suppose on the revenue front, a good turnaround year-on-year from what happened second half of last year and into Q1 of this year. So I'm just trying to understand that the growth drivers there. And again, comps are pretty easy in the second half and on sales and the bookings growth was good in Q2. So just trying to understand kind of how strong could that growth be in the back half? And I realize the incrementals are exceptional to a degree with mix, but should we see at least very strong incrementals again in the second half? Richard J. Tobin: Yes. That's hard to say, right? I think at the end of the day, you have a pretty strong mix effect in Q2, right, because of consumables being proportionately higher than kind of average, I mean printer shipments actually dilute margins at the end of the day. So the per dollar shipment value is higher. But the margin dollars per revenue comes down a little bit. Look, we're really happy with the margin performance. This business over the long run [ph] is a steady eddy. I think the management has done a great job of moving the margin up through more or less efficiency more than anything else. So we'd expect that to continue. But I wouldn't be surprised if you saw a little bit of margin dilution in the second half, especially if printer shipments move up proportionally to the consumables. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then just \u2013 I know you don't give much understandable, you don't give much color on the sort of quarterly cadence of earnings, but we're halfway through the year. And the seasonality has been confusing in recent years. So I just wondered sort of when we think about third and fourth quarter total Dover earnings sequentially, if you like, is it sort of Q3 up a bit sequentially on earnings and then down sequentially in Q4? Is that the way to think about it? Richard J. Tobin: Yes. Well, the way we think about it is Q1, Q2 and Q3 tend to be up and then Q4 usually is a flex quarter, and it depends on order rates and whether we drive for cash, we're really bullish on 2025 and whether we build inventory or not in Q4. I would I think that, that kind of sequential performance is going to hold for this year. And that's what we've built into our forecast. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks. Operator : We'll go now to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Hey guys. Good morning. Richard J. Tobin: Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Hi, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey, so I'm going to start on ESG because Rich, I guess I was \u2013 maybe I was the only one that was surprised that you guys ended up selling the business. I just thought of it as being a good margin, good return type business. I'm curious kind of what went into that decision as you thought about evaluating that asset over the long term? Richard J. Tobin: I don't know, Joe, I think that we've been fielding questions on the capital goods portion of our portfolio as long as I've been here. And we had said at least initially that we thought that we could improve the performance of the business. So that we were going to be patient and wait if someone was interested in it that we were going to wait to make sure that we are paid appropriately for it. I mean, I know that there's lots of different calculations about what we were paid, but the bottom line is on a, call it, a Q1 exit LTM basis, we got 13x EBITDA. And I come from capital goods. So the three premier companies and capital goods in the United States are PACCAR, Deere and Caterpillar and look where they trade on an EBITDA multiple basis. So at that point, that we think that we can monetize there. We should because at the end of the day, from a summer parts point of view, we get a capital goods multiple in that business. It's one of our \u2013 I don't want to talk to business down because the management team did a phenomenal job in terms of the performance of it, but the bottom line is it's one of our lowest gross margin businesses in the portfolio. So to the extent that we need to kind of mix up over time, and we're paid appropriately. I think that that's the way we look at it. Joe Ritchie : That's super helpful. And then I guess just my follow-up question and maybe just kind of talking about some of the other longer cycle pieces of your portfolio. So I'm thinking SWEP, Belvac and MAAG, what's kind of the expectation embedded into guidance for growth for those businesses this year? And is it too early to maybe start talking about 2025 and what those businesses could do? Richard J. Tobin: Look, I think that SWEP [indiscernible] heat exchange or heat pump debate, I think has been beaten to death at this point. Everybody got very excited. The problem with having exposure to subsidize products. It's great when they're subsidized. It's not so great when they're not subsidized. So we're just going to have to deal with that. So if I take that away and I looked at SWEP over time, we actually don't think that, that is a cyclical long-cycle business. We think that, that's just a component parts business that just went through a kind of an adoption rate on heat pumps through legislation in Europe that we're not going to apologize for when the market was there, you seize the market. So I think once we get through this whole period, which hopefully knock wood will be at the end of Q3 that, that would just go back to being a non-cyclical asset going forward from here. Maag is a little bit more CapEx driven. Belvac is a little bit more CapEx driven. I will say that Maag is likely to be less cyclical than it's been in the past because I think the management team. Has done a really good job opening up the vectors in terms of what we sell, and there's actually a pretty large installed spare parts business there. Belvac is always going to be cyclical, but that's not a tail that's going to wag the dog. It's just not that big in our portfolio. Joe Ritchie : Yes. It's super helpful. Thank you. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks. Operator : We'll hear now from Mike Halloran with Baird. Mike Halloran : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Richard J. Tobin: Hi Mike. Mike Halloran : Just one for me, [indiscernible] 2 part of this. So as you think about the short-cycle trends, you talked about some choppiness in the order patterns through the quarter. Maybe just talk about how you're thinking about the short-cycle trends? And then secondarily, if there are any leading indicators in those end markets or product categories where you're seeing signs of concern or inversely \u2013 conversely, excuse me, signs of acceleration? Thanks. Richard J. Tobin: That's \u2013 I don't want to march through the entire portfolio. It's just been choppy all year in short cycle. I think distribution is still digesting higher interest costs. The GDP print today was good, at least for North America, it's not been great out of Europe for a period of time. So there's a lot of uncertainty of kind of what the catalyst is for demand. So I think I mentioned in my earlier comments, like intra-quarter volatility of order rates we have like heart attacks around here week-over-week because it kind of flexes all over the place. But when you let the tide go out we're still growing the top line. I think that the areas that we know that are in cyclical down trends, we've got a handle on that. I'd like to see fueling do better. I think that, that's been a little bit slower than we would have expected through the first half. We're going to keep a close eye on order rates there going into the second half. And our expectation is because we've got easier comps in the second half that by and large, the hurdle rate for orders is in Herculean. Mike Halloran : Thanks Rich. Richard J. Tobin: Thanks. Operator : We'll go now to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Richard J. Tobin: Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Deane, how are you? Deane Dray : Rich, I really like seeing this pivot into a higher up the technology curve, these critical components that are typically a lower cost of the project. And I know you're not going to kind of reveal exactly the areas that you're moving into. But you did \u2013 you characterize ESG divestiture as pivoting away from capital goods. And then Joe, your answer to Joe's question, you gave some color there, but there are still lots of capital goods exposures in the portfolio. So where do you draw the line? What's the timing? You've made lots of margin improvements. You said that was kind of the gating factor. But where do you draw the line? And how much change can the organization take at just a given point in time? Richard J. Tobin: There's nothing that we have to sell, Deane, and we didn't have to sell ESG either, right? And if I go and look on return on invested capital in ESG it's been great, right? Because the earnings \u2013 the earnings improvement has been terrific. It's an older asset. So you got to always be careful with ROIC because its asset base has been depreciated over a long period of time. So it gets a little bit flatter there. But I don't want to repeat myself, but we spend an inordinate amount of time here doing our own sum of parts on every piece of this portfolio. So we've got a clear understanding at what hurdle rates are for monetization. But we're not going to win to address the portfolio and sell things at below intrinsic value, just to make the gross margin go up by 50 basis points. So, I can't tell you about the timing. We'll just going to have to be patient. And what we see when we go over there, I think that the important issue to understand is that we've got optionality in terms of firepower that a lot of people don't have, meaning that we can lever up on an M&A front and then delever by monetization. That's not what we did here. I think we were just more opportunistic, but that is something that's an arrow in our quiver going forward. Deane Dray : That's really helpful. Thank you for that context. And then just a question for Brad. There's an expectation of working capital improvements in the second half. Can you give us some color there or any specifics? And then what about \u2013 what should we be thinking about buybacks for the second half? Brad Cerepak : Well, I think, Rich, I take the second part of that question first. I think Rich already answered that in a sense that our priority is around capital deployment to M&A, especially as we move here into the second half with market conditions of available assets that we see. So I think that's a positive thing for us as we move through the year. In terms of the trajectory on working capital and cash flow, I mean really, it's no different than last year when you think about it. I mean we're on pace with the prior year. We have good line of sight in terms of what we need to do in the back half around inventory and receivables, and it's all highly achievable in the same pattern that we saw last year. So we have pretty good confidence. We have confidence in the 13% to 15% at this stage. Deane Dray : Thank you. Brad Cerepak : Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our final question today from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks for taking me in guys. Good morning. Look, I know there's been a lot of questions on the cryogenic kind of strategy. But the Marshall Excelsior deal looks really interesting. And the 10 points of synergies that you called out, kind of got my attention. So maybe just Rich remind us, what sort of growth do you expect the market to kind of compound out for the next three years to five years. With this cluster of businesses, do you think you can gain share and outgrow that market? And maybe just \u2013 I don't know if you can tell us this, but what is the entry margin for the Marshall deal? Richard J. Tobin: Okay. Well, I don't have to remind you about the growth rate, because I don't think we ever gave you one. Nigel Coe : Okay. Richard J. Tobin: Look, we're going to give you like \u2013 you may have missed it at the beginning, I think that because we built this platform, our intention is to resegment it into its own platform. And when we do that, we're going to give you a presentation of long-term growth outlook and everything else. I can tell you that the profile of what we've been buying has been around 20% margin \u2013 and I think then between synergy value and accelerated growth, we think within a 24-month period, we can get it to 25% EBITDA margin. So that's kind of the economics behind it. Nigel Coe : Yes. Sorry, I missed the first part of the call, so I missed that detail. Richard J. Tobin: No problem. Nigel Coe : And the 10 points, would that be primarily cost or is it exclusively cost? Or is there some ready synergy as well? Richard J. Tobin: No revenue synergy. It's all we know \u2013 you've seen us make the presentations before about back-office consolidation and all those things that we have. We've got a whole system that's in place in this particular case. We actually think we've got some backward integration footprint opportunity here from our legacy businesses. So those are really the two big pieces. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks, Rich. And then just for Brad, just some details on the ESG. So the discontinuation, is that on a go-forward basis, so that will be a second half impact? Or do you have to go back and discontinue for the first half as well? And then is it \u2013 do you have any sense yet on the tax leakage on the deal? Brad Cerepak : Yes. So as it relates to discontinued ops, it would be all prior periods presented. So we really restate everything. Once we get to a point in time here later in the third quarter, we'll be taking a hard look at that and they probably dropped at that point in time, and you'll see all the restatements filed in advance. So we have that data in advance. And on tax leakage, you should just assume a normalized U.S. type of tax rate, 21% or so in the leakage. Nigel Coe : Okay, thanks, Brad. Brad Cerepak : It's very possible that, that cash tax is unlike De-Sta-Co goes out this year. So we're looking at that timing as well. Nigel Coe : Okay. But that wouldn't be in your guide, right, for the free cash flow, that would be... Brad Cerepak : No, we'll handle the same way we handle the De-Sta-Co by adjusting free cash flow. Nigel Coe : Great. Okay. Thanks, Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thanks. Operator : Thank you, everyone. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call.

Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Jack Dickens, Senior Director, Investor Relations. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Dickens : Thank you, Connie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of the call will be available on our website through November 14th, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our presentation today is on a continuing operations basis to exclude the impact of our divested waste tolling equipment business from historical results. Please reference the 8-K filed on October 10th for further information. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. And with that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with the performance highlights on Page 3. Overall, the quarter was modestly better than our internal forecast, which I'll cover in the upcoming segment results slides. Top line performance was broad-based across the portfolio. We are especially pleased that the rotation from our longer cycle businesses to our growth platforms has continued to drive positive margin mix for the total portfolio. We expect that to be an underlying theme as we head into 2025. Segment margin performance for the quarter was solid at 22.6% and represents an all-time high for Dover's consolidated portfolio. Bookings were up 5% organically in the quarter with particular strength clean energy, thermal connectors, CO2 systems and biopharma components, further bolstering our positive mix outlook. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up 6% to $2.27. During the quarter, we completed the divestiture of our Environmental Solutions Group business, reducing our exposure to the capital goods sector. As you can see from the bottom right of the slide, the reconciliation of this impact to our full year adjusted EPS guidance from continuing operations. As a result of this transaction, we will exit 2024 with record capital deployment, firepower, providing us with a variety of value-creation opportunities going forward. Our outlook remains constructive for the balance of the year. Our third quarter performance has given us room to manage demand seasonality to drive cash flow optimization through year-end by thoughtfully managing capacity utilization. Our setup for 2025 is compelling with positive portfolio rotation into higher margin businesses as we lap easy and long cycle comps through the year. This is further augmented by our exceptional balance sheet, optionality to pursue value-creating capital deployment strategies. Let's skip to Slide 5 on segment performance. Engineered Products posted strong top line performance on volume growth in vehicle services and industrial winches. Aerospace and defense was lower in the period due to shipment timing and a difficult comparable quarter. Margin was down modestly, because of margin mix on reduced aerospace and defense volumes. Clean Energy & Fueling was down 1% organic as positive performance in clean energy components and North American retail fueling was offset by lower volumes in vehicle wash and retail fueling equipment in Europe and Asia. Bookings were positive in the quarter, as below-ground retail fueling volumes are inflecting positively along with cryogenic components. Margin was flat as favorable product mix was offset by near-term integration costs of our most recent acquisitions. We expect this dynamic to have a material positive margin swing, as we complete our integration activities through 2025. Imaging & Identification posted an excellent quarter on solid marketing and coating performance in the U.S. and Europe. New printer shipments inflected positively during the quarter, which is a good signal for customer capital spending. Margin performance was robust as management actions on cost to serve and footprint optimization continued to drive incremental margins. Pumps & Process Solutions was up 2% organically on robust shipments in thermal connectors precision components biopharma connectors and pumps, biopharma revenue is up mid-teens, year-to-date and over 30% versus the comparable quarter of the prior year. As forecasted, polymer processing equipment was down in the period. All in, Pumps & Process Solutions segment bookings were up 15% organically in the quarter as biopharma and growth platform cycles inflected positively. Segment revenue mix drove 200 basis points of margin improvement on excellent performance, production performance on volume growth in Biopharma and thermal margin mix from FW -- the FW Murphy acquisition and tight cost controls in -- in the Polymers business. Revenue was down in the quarter in Climate & Sustainability Technologies as solid demand in food retail systems was offset by tough comps, in beverage can making equipment and weak demand in the broader HVAC complex, particularly in European residential heat pumps, on our brazed plate heat exchanger business. We had hoped to see positive bookings inflection in heat exchangers in the quarter, but that was not the case. So we have taken down our forecast in the back half of the year in that business to preserve production performance for 2025. The frustrating results as we were able to hold segment margins flat despite the lower volumes due to excellent performance in our retail refrigeration business that was augmented by exceptionally good shipment rates in CO2 systems. Despite the short-term challenges, we like the setup going into 2025 based on increasing CO2 demand, where we expect bookings to inflect materially higher together with market recovery and heat exchanges, both of which are margin accretive. I'll pass it to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 6, just a reminder that our presentation today is on a continuing operations basis excluding our divested Environmental Solutions Group business from the historical results. Let's go to the charts. The top bridge shows our revenue growth. The impact of acquired businesses this year more than offset the disposition of DESTACO which closed on March 31 by $21 million, while FX was basically flat. From a geographic perspective, the US, our largest market, was up 8% in the quarter on healthy broad-based demand. Europe and Asia were down 5% and 10%, respectively. China, which represents about half our revenue base in Asia was down 17% organically in the quarter, primarily due to shipment timing within polymer processing. On the bottom chart, bookings were up $90 million organically year-over-year on solid broad-based demand across most end markets. Below-the-line items were slightly unfavorable on a year-over-year basis in the quarter on higher corporate costs, mostly related to acquisition deal costs. Our cash flow statement is on Slide 7. Adjusting for taxes paid on the gain of DESTACO, which are non-operational in nature, our free cash flow was 17% of revenue in the quarter, up $48 million year-over-year. Year-to-date cash flow on this chart is 11% of revenue. The fourth quarter is historically our highest cash flow quarter as we expect more favorable working capital balances over the rest of the year. We are on track to deliver our full year adjusted free cash flow guidance of 13% to 15% of revenue, unchanged from prior guidance. With that, let me turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Brad. I'm on Slide 8. It was a busy quarter with the portfolio moves, discontinued ops and some counter cyclicality within the portfolio. As a result of that, we thought it prudent to lay the groundwork for 2025 earlier to provide some hopefully helpful views. Let's start with the portfolio. We articulated throughout the year that underlying demand across many of our end marks -- end markets is solid, and that remains the case as we look forward into 2025. With a diverse portfolio such as ours, we enter each planning cycle, constructing a view of the overall macro, the individual business cycles and our competitive position. In 2024, we had a familiar challenge much like we did in the post-COVID period navigating the biopharma demand cycle. In 2024, we managed a down cycle on the portion of our high long-cycle portfolio as well as the regulatory and stocking idiosyncrasies, cheeses and heat exchangers as shown on the right side of the page. As you can see on the slide, we managed to offset significant cycle headwind with mixing up our consolidated margin on broader short-cycle improvement augmented by our growth platforms, which we invested in both organically and inorganically. As we complete 2024 and begin forming our view for 2025, we do not receive the same counter cyclicality in the portfolio. Bookings and customer forecasts indicate that our growth platforms are in a multi-period demand cycle. We are particularly pleased with the growth rate and biopharma components, thermal connectors, precision components and CO2 systems, all with margin accretion attributes to the portfolio. We expect heat exchanges to return to growth in 2025 on the recovery heat pumps and large-format demand district heating and data center applications for which we are expanding production capacity today. Let's move to Slide 9. Organic investment, inorganic growth and shareholder-friendly capital return remain front and center to our strategy, and we have done all three so far in 2024. We have been more active on portfolio pruning this year at attractive valuations as we methodically reshaped the portfolio to higher secular growth and less cyclical end market exposures. As mentioned earlier, we will exit 2024 with significant optionality for capital deployment and/or capital return, which is reflected on the balance sheet capacity bar on the right. Let's finish up with Slide 10. I've already covered the adjusted EPS guidance to accommodate the discontinued operations earlier in the deck, which is summarized on the left. At the time of the ESG announcement, we are often asked about the assumptions needed to offset the lost earnings from divestitures in 2025. We prepared the bridge on the slide to provide some direction on the moving pieces on a pro forma basis. Let's not get too excited. We will, as always, provide formal 2025 guidance after the close of the year, but I thought it would -- I thought, but I hope that you find it to be a reasonable pro forma view that provides clarity on the moving parts. Left to right, we start with predisposal EPS from our previous guide. We treat retrospectively the disposals on a full year basis. We treat the cash balance prospectively as it ever held for the full year in the short-term in highly liquid positions where it is presently, which includes the retirement of commercial paper costs in 2024 and we roll forward the 2024 acquisitions earnings benefit. We get to a rebased 2025 EPS of $8.60 to $8.75 on a base model that assumes zero organic growth in 2025. If we model a 3% to 5% organic growth at a 40% conversion rate next year, which includes $25 million in restructuring roll forward that is already completed or underway this year. We get an additional $0.55 to $0.90 of EPS. As I mentioned earlier, we are accelerating our synergy capture from recent acquisitions, including footprint consolidation, so what I would expect the restructuring contribution to be higher in 2025. Considering what was covered in the growth platform's growth trajectory, margin mix and long cycle comparable performance that we discussed on Slide 8, the top line and incremental margin assumptions seem reasonable. Now, I certainly doubt that we'll sit on that amount of liquidity unless there is a drastic negative change in the macro. And then in that case, it is nice to have an insurance policy. Clearly, this model can be flexed for share repurchases and M&A, but the model timing is problematic. So this is a simple value view. Our preference is to be active on the M&A front. And at present, that environment is getting better. We have an interesting opportunity pipeline, but rest assured, we will proceed with the capital discipline that we have demonstrated in the past. With that, let's go to Q&A. And I won't say any of opacities or whatever. Okay. Let's go. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. We're all [indiscernible] this morning. Richard Tobin : Good morning, Jeff. Brad Cerepak : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Good morning. Yes. It's early. It's early, but it feels late. Just on the comment on climate sustainability, Rich, that you made as you were going through kind of the opening comments. The comment about materially higher in 2025, was that a total segment comment, a heat pump comment? Can you just maybe elaborate on the moving pieces within that segment in particular? Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean I think there was a bookings comment more than anything else. If you recall back last quarter, we had said that we would hope to have seen bookings increase in brazed plate heat exchanges for European heat pumps. That was not the case. So we have taken down our full year estimates in that particular product line. So that's negative to bookings now. We're going to take down production just to let whatever the remaining clearing event needs to take place between now and the end of the year. So we'll cut production in Q4 also in terms of the estimates. At that point, I think it's fair to say that bookings based on what we see in our forecast for 2025 demand and heat pumps should inflect positively going forward there, and in CO2 systems based on feedback that we're getting from the market in terms of spend, we would expect a material amount of bookings inflection there, whether we get it all in Q4, whether it splits between Q4 and Q1, we'll see. But based on our market read there, we think that we're going to be materially up on CO2 systems in 2025. Jeff Sprague : And then I appreciate the bridge here, it's definitely helpful. Just thinking about that $0.50, right, that's tied to cash on hand. Obviously, the deal impact can vary depending on what you pay for stuff and the right multiples. Do you foresee a scenario where it's less than $0.50, because you're more active on the M&A front. How should we think about that? Richard Tobin : Yes. I mean, and that's -- I tried to cover that in the commentary, Jeff. Look, at the end of the day, someone described that the in the bag, it would be just to sit on the liquidity and that liquidity, you can just basically say that deposit rates even with factoring in rate cuts would drive that kind of result. In my comments, I said, I don't foresee that actually happening. Now whether it's M&A or share repurchases, that math gets funky, right? Because you got to start, but we've done the models here and said, if it's margin accretive, and we paid 15 times, what does that look what does that look like? And if you close it into Q1, what does that look like? Or if we did a share repurchase of $1 billion, like? You can do those scenarios. But we just thought that optically to give you a view of it's not only the -- not 2021 anymore, where holding on to liquidity was a zero-sum game because your cost of carry was neutral, if not negative. Now, it's meaningful. And if you go back and look at our interest cost on commercial paper in 2024 and you add that back again, the gap that we have in the lost earnings is really what we're trying to show here is significantly reduced because of that carry. So, I hope and I would expect that the interest income line is going to be overstated because I would expect us to deploy M&A capital. But just as a note, that cash balance is just the proceeds and the after-tax proceeds of the disposals and it doesn't really factor in our Q4 cash flow. So that number is a little bit understated anyway. Jeff Sprague : Very clear. Right. And also you got additional leverage to deploy if you want to. Great. Appreciate it. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Richard Tobin : Yes. Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe a lot of good color on the slides. Maybe one thing I wanted to touch on was just -- the overall organic growth backdrop. Your tone sounds pretty confident. I think bookings up mid-single-digit organic is sort of broadly what you expected. Just wondered sort of what your impression was of the broader environment in terms of customer activity, anything notable moving around? And tied to that, when we look at your segments, say in Q3, very, very wide spread of organic growth outcomes. One division up low double digit, one down high single-digits, when we're thinking about the 3% to 5% framework you have on Slide 10 for 2025, is the core assumption that the sort of variability across the five segments is much narrower and kind of all are contributing to growth. Richard Tobin : Yes, Julian, I think that's what we were trying to do with the Slide 8. I mean, I think -- the $300 million headwind was like a 4% or 5% growth headwind that we carried into this year that we were able to offset by the kind of the investments in our growth exposures. So what we're saying is, here we don't see any indication on the growth platforms for that growth rate, the law small numbers, of course, is that will continue at the same pace, I guess, in terms of growth going forward. And then we'll begin to lap the headwind that we have, basically, which is a long cycle part, is beverage can making, which is completely bottomed at this point and polymer processing, which we believe has bottomed at Q4 what we're going to see in heat exchanges next year. I'd like another quarter to figure it out and see what everybody is going to say about heat exchanges. But what we can from our channel checks, we would expect that by cutting production in Q4 will probably undercut into the market and just push demand into next year. So, if I look at the core portfolio, I don't see anything else that is in cycle down in 2025. We're just getting that behind us. And that was a 3% to -- 3% to -- 4% to 5% or 4% to 5% headwind this year. So that's why I think it's reasonable to expect I think when we modeled the year was 3% to 5% and the incremental margin, if you take out the restructuring benefit is basically where we've always been at 25 to 35. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just maybe one quick follow-up on one of the segments. DII doesn't often get much attention, but superlative margin performance again in that business in Q3. You've seen that in the first half also. So, maybe sort of clarify. I know there's a mix commentary as a tailwind for DII. But is that something -- I don't know, structural changing in the mix in terms of kind how you've repositioned that business or it's simply just the consumables versus equipment dynamic and that may flip around next year? Richard Tobin : The consumables equipment will fluctuate quarter-by-quarter. But if you look at it over longer periods, it's not overly meaningful. So it does -- you hear comments quarter-to-quarter about it, but over a 12-month cycle, it always ends up in the same spot. Really, the margin performance here is that that the management team of particular business has done an excellent job on cost to serve. This is a global business. There -- it's synergy extraction from the cost to serve on a global basis. So, I mean that's the majority of -- if you go back and look over the last three years to four years, not generally been volume, it's been a business model change. So I don't think that these margins that we're posting now because I know what the pipeline is for 2025 and 2026. I think that this is a reasonable approximation where this business is capable of delivering. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Richard Tobin : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Hey, Scott. Scott Davis : Hey, I wanted to follow-up a little bit on the M&A question. I think it was Jeff. It seems -- the deals we've seen in the last couple of years is that in the multiple ranges. The only deals that are kind of working are the ones where there's a fair amount of synergies. Is that -- is this something -- when you guys look at your existing portfolio, is there a wide enough net there to be able to buy things that bolt-on to make you kind of the, what I'll say, the best owner of that asset? Or do you think or multiples come down to the level where that's no longer the case? Richard Tobin : I think that if you go back and look at multiples paid here over the last four to five years, I think they've been reasonable. And at the time of the announcement on the kind of more material deals, there was always a good portion of the return that was based on synergy extraction. The smaller deals, there's really not a lot to do. But the bigger deals, we've built basically an engine on our existing -- if you think about when we went through from 2018 to about 2022, we had built this engine to extract synergies out of our own core portfolio, which drove a lot of margin expansion, while the benefit of building those engines, if you will, is when we do an M&A, we just do the same playbook just because we practice on ourselves for five years. So, they need to be a decent of enough size, but I think everything that we did of the bigger ones recently in Clean Energy had a good amount of synergy extraction. And if you go back and look at the transcript and you look on the clean energy side, I think that we posted a 20% margin this year. It's going to take us probably three quarters of 2025 to finish up on the footprint and everything else, but we fully expect to drive those businesses up to 2025 on synergy extraction alone. Scott Davis : Okay. That's good color. Guys, maybe a dumb question. But when you're selling these thermal connectors, who's specking in the product? Is it the cloud guys? Or is it the cooling guys? And I still get -- want back in your good go on that design. Richard Tobin : Yes. Look, I'll answer it this way. We've been in this business for quite a while. So it's not a product that we're ramping up because of AI build-out. This product was actually built for supercomputing applications, which are the only ones that were using water cooling is relatively low volume in the past. So, it is set out and there are recommended specs, but you still need to sell to the user and/or builder. So, it's complicated, but we would -- we're the ones, I think, that we can claim to have the most product that's actually in use in the ecosystem today. Scott Davis : Right. But the point is once it's spec-ed in, if it needs to be replaced to preventive maintenance or whatever, it's like-for-like, right? Richard Tobin : I think that would be the assumption, yes. Scott Davis : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you guys. Good luck. Richard Tobin : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Deane Dray, RBC. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Deane Dray : On the biopharma, the recovery underway in the single-use is what are the green shoots you're looking for? We saw results that would suggest from Danaher in particular, so is there anything broader going on in terms of how you think, because it's been the most extended destocking period for everyone, but just any color there would be helpful? Richard Tobin : Sure. Look, we led down because of the amount of inventory post-COVID that had put into the channel, and we're leading out, because these are consumable products, so these don't require new builds of new systems. They just need the systems that have been sold in previous periods to continue to operate. So, for a while, there was a little bit of de-linkage because we were going down early and from what our customers are saying, I think that we've been reading the reports from the market participants, and we're mostly in line now. I think we're all saying that basically the same thing in terms of the trajectory and the recovery. And I think that, that is reflected in our growth rates in terms of the consumables portion of it. Deane Dray : Good. And now you'll have doubled the amount of imaging questions that you typically get. Your primary competitor made a lot of noise about broadening our platform, what they call from source to shelf they're more vertically integrated than you guys, but is that a broader platform that you all would be interested in participating in. Do you have aspirations there, they paid up pretty sizably for a SaaS business? Richard Tobin : Deane, are we talking about the acquisition that they just made? Deane Dray : Yes. But then the-- Richard Tobin : Yes, I mean, we've got a good sized track and trace platform within that business today. So I think it's nuanced in terms of where you are in the chain, we're more pharma oriented. And I haven't studied it, that looks like it's more food-oriented. So we've got a pretty big business right now that's actually been doing quite well over the last couple of years in that space. So we're already there. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. Richard Tobin : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Nigel Coe, Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. And thanks for the 2025 kind of help out there. So it sounds, Rich, like you're pretty -- sort of like the base case would be organic range you laid out there. So, you'd encourage us to kind of use that range. But what I'm kind of curious of is when we look at the -- look at the 2024 performance, what impact did you have from the capital businesses, MAAG, Belvac and the SWEP European businesses? If we assume that those are bottoming out this year, maybe stabilize next year, what is the mechanical impact of those businesses? Richard Tobin : Nigel, if you go to Slide 8, on the presentation. We give you the absolute number. And it's -- I'm going to get it wrong, 3% to 5% -- 4% to 5% headwind that we're taking and that is on a rolling 12-month basis, correct? Q4 of last year through Q3 this year. It's cost us $300 million of headwinds and that's about 4% or 5% growth. Nigel Coe : Okay. I completely missed that. So again, so if that then flattens out, your 3% to 5% seems -- I don't know, no improvement in the rest of the businesses. Is that the right way to react? Richard Tobin : Like you may have missed the beginning here. I mean we're not giving out 2025 guidance, we just thought that it was important because of all the noise with discontinued ops and everything else to kind of let you rebase your look on 2025. I didn't want to come out to this thing and say, well, here's discontinued ops, and we'll tell you in January, what that all means. So, it's a reasonable approximation, but give us another quarter to get an understanding of the macro and everything else. And I'm not saying that those are exactly going to be the numbers that we give out for 2025 guidance, but they look reasonable based on using the growth rates that we have on our secular growth exposures and then a lapping of the headwinds that we have seems reasonable. But rest assured, we'll update them in January. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's a good boiled plate response, Rich. And then just on -- just a quick clarification on the 4Q guide and then I'll pass it on. The 4Q -- sorry, the full year EPS the so I'm guessing there's about $0.10 of interest income coming through in the fourth quarter from the ESG divestment proceeds. So is that wrapped into the 102 -- or is that sort of within the $0.05 kind of bump up to the low end? Just any help there. Richard Tobin : I don't know whether it's $0.10. I'd have to go back and look at deconstruct it. There is an amount of interest income that's in the bump. That helps to offset what I mentioned earlier about we're taking heat exchanger volumes down, and we're making some production cuts there. So, yes, it's all in right now. And at the end of the day, we're driving towards the top of the range as usual. Nigel Coe : Yes, okay. Thanks, Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Joe O'Dea, Wells Fargo. Joe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Joe O'Dea: Just wanted to touch on fueling and the comments around below-ground fueling inflecting positively. And any sort of context or perspective in terms of the cycle trends there and what you're seeing now in terms of how early on we are in seeing some growth? Richard Tobin : Yes, I mean that's been a headwind for us for three years, I think, right, because it suffered with inflationary inputs and the lack of ability of labor and a variety of things that if you had gone and looked at the CapEx projections, for retail operators, they never hit their numbers just because of the inflation that was going through the system. So, with labor costs and labor just availability getting better, we've seen that begin to inflect positively, which is great because it's margin accretive to that particular business. So -- and we would expect that to cycle forward from here. On the demand side of it, it's been relatively muted, so you can't see it, but that is us. We are managing this business for margin, and I think we've made some tougher decisions about business that we would take, particularly in Europe and Asia. So that has muted the top line growth because we -- because in combination with the cryogenic components, if we get this right, we can get the entire segment up to 25% EBITDA margin at kind of an exit rate 25 or at least that's the goal. Joe O'Dea: I appreciate that. And then I just wanted to circle back on the restructuring. I think you talked about as we head into next year, $25 million of carryover, but also made some comments that there could be more. And so I just wanted to make sure I heard that correctly in terms of are there additional sort of planning efforts underway and where we could see more of that happening across the business? Richard Tobin : Yes, I think that the $25 million is either completed or to be completed in fiscal year 2024. So that's the roll forward of what we get done this year. But we've got a lot to go. Like I mentioned previously, I think that the synergy target that we had put in the cryogenic acquisitions was about $20-ish, some of that requires footprint consolidation over time, which takes longer. So, back to my comment about driving that segment to 25%, we will be incurring costs clearly through the first two to three quarters of next year, which will require some more restructuring costs, which will pick up in kind of the further roll forward. So that number that you see in the chart, again, is incurred or to be completed in fiscal year 2024. Joe O'Dea: Understood. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. Richard Tobin : Hi, Steve. Steve Tusa : I'm going to ask an even dumber question than Scott. What is the actual revenue kind of guidance for this year, like the absolute kind of rough number you're guiding to for this year? Richard Tobin : I don't know. I think we gave you a range in the top line, right, of one to three. So-- Steve Tusa : Right. But off of like -- is it like a $7.6 billion number, something like that comes out to? Richard Tobin : I don't know off the top of my head. Got me. Steve Tusa : I'm kind of -- I guess it's not a dumb question. Richard Tobin : I'm sure we can get it, and you can follow up with Jack to give it to you, but I don't know what the exact baseline number that it comes off. Steve Tusa : I think it's 77, by my math, just wanted to double check that. So how big are the headwinds... Richard Tobin : This is like questions about net interest income and your boss address that. Anyway, keep going. Steve Tusa : Sorry, like total top line absolute sales Richard Tobin : Yes. Steve Tusa : Kind of important, I think. Don't you think? Richard Tobin : Well, I think that you'd be able to model that. But go ahead. Steve Tusa : Like don't people ask you like cocktail parties, like how big the company is you run and you kind of throw out $8 billion and stuff like you should know that, right? Richard Tobin : I'm not a curtail party guy, but anyway, keep going. Steve Tusa : The headwind businesses, as we'll call them, how big are those this year? Are those about like $3 billion in total? Richard Tobin : No, no, no. Steve Tusa : $1 billion. Something like that? Richard Tobin : I'd have to do the math in my head. I mean, what are we talking on a 2024 full year basis? Steve Tusa : Yes. I mean just like what were -- like the $300 million was off of like what base, like-- Richard Tobin : Yes like $1 billion -- I'm doing it in the back of my head, it's like $1 billion. Steve Tusa : Yes. Okay, got it. And as far as like your outlook next year for pricing, is it a little more normal? Is it anywhere that you're seeing any kind of price pressure? Or is it kind of modestly positive or maybe even like a point or something like that for next year? Richard Tobin : Modestly -- modest -- more mix than anything else, but modestly positive on pricing. And to that end, we've been taking advantage of going long into 2025 because input pricing on commodity metals is pretty favorable. So we've been going actually going -- actually gone out of the 2025 to help that out. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then just one last one for you. For the other businesses, kind of the mixed bag businesses outside of DII, of course, any of those in there that are kind of like on watch for like declines next year? And any that worry you out of the other -- not the secular growth, not DII and not the headwind businesses like the other business? Richard Tobin : Try to cover in the commentary. We knew about Belvac. We knew about MAAG. We kind of knew but got it wrong on heat exchangers. There's not another business in the portfolio with that kind of quantum headwind as we look into 2025. So the only kind of worry that we would have would be about the macro, and then we'll see. Steve Tusa : Right. Okay. That\u2019s all I got. Thanks a lot. Richard Tobin : Great. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Hi, good morning, guys. Richard Tobin : Hi, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Tough act to follow there. The -- so I'm going to ask Steve's question may be slightly more positively or class have full. If I -- we're getting to, hopefully, election certainty sometime in the next month or so. Project financing arguably hopefully getting better because of interest rates. You've had one of your competitors call out the fact that, that's really impacted their carwash business as you kind of think through like that macro element, which is both election and interest rates, like where could you potentially see a benefit to your business? And how do you see that kind of playing out in 2025? And know that you don't have a crystal ball, so your best guess at this point. Richard Tobin : Yes, I mean I think we would have hoped that interest rates would have had a bigger impact in the second half of 2024 on volume. But I think because of election uncertainty and a variety of other things, you can feel a little bit of caution out there. It's not bad, but it's not the amount -- if we take a look at the amount of quoting that we do for project-based business versus the time that it takes for those quotes to turn into actual orders, you can -- and this notion of things being pushed that you'll hear a lot about, that's not a fail, right? So, -- to the extent that cost of capital stays down and that we get some kind of certainty going into 2025, I would expect -- if we take a look at some of our businesses that you could call kind of like more project related that we would expect that to inflect positively. Joe Ritchie : Okay, fair enough. And then we talked a little bit about the recovery in biopharma, which is awesome to see. The next kind of logical question is like when can we get the margins back up to that 30-plus range. And I know that you're feeling good about the recovery of that business into 2025, and so just kind of any thoughts around getting back to 30% next year? Richard Tobin : Well, it was 29% in the quarter. And that's taking into account still -- still taking into account that MAAG is probably is bottoming now. And by the way, to MAAG's credit despite the top line headwinds, their ability to preserve margins during that period was excellent. So, to me, it's more of what is going to be the growth rate in biopharma and thermal and single-use pumps, everything that we've got in that particular segment to the extent that it stays on the track that it is, it's all incremental margin positive to the 29% we just posted. Joe Ritchie : Good to hear. Great. Thanks guys. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Brad Cerepak : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Rich, with the understanding that you aren't giving out 2025 guidance, as you just said, you did say that do 40% incrementals with some restructuring tailwind and mix benefits. And as you know, you've talked about 25% to 35% long-term incremental. So, should we get more excited at this point that with accelerated portfolio transformation, Dover is really making that transition to a higher incremental margin capable company? Or is that a bit premature? Richard Tobin : No, I don't think it's premature at all at the end of the day. I mean, we love ESG, but the fact of the matter is, it was a high-growth business that had decremental margins to the greater portfolio. And that's -- other than end market cyclicality and blah, blah, blah part of the reason that we took the action that we took. So -- and I don't want to keep repeating myself, but if you go back to Slide 8, Slide 8 is what we talked about back at the last Investor Day, this is where we're investing in organically and inorganically. And hopefully, we should be doing that in businesses that have higher growth rates and higher margin profiles to them. I mean you saw it -- you saw it yourself an action when you went down to DFR and Conyers, I mean that CO2 systems business is a high-growth, high incremental margin to the segment business. So it's -- we've got all the irons in the fire, whether it's portfolio construction or organic investment or inorganic investment, it's all part and parcel to driving the consolidated segment margin to 2025, right? And we're going to get there by hook or by crook. Andy Kaplowitz : Love it. Okay. And then just another question you love around bookings. Just one clarification, like was DCST really the heat exchanger stuff, the big difference in what you thought versus that book-to-bill of one. I know you mentioned macro is maybe still holding some projects back. As you look at Q4, do you see book-to-bill getting closer to one if CST does begin to show some life on the heat exchanger side? Richard Tobin : It depends on what the order intake is going to be in CO2 systems because we're basically taking bookings assumptions down for heat pumps. So what we had originally forecast for heat pumps is worse going into Q4 which is accommodated into our forecast. Whether we can -- we know -- maybe I should be that definitive. We expect that we will inflect materially higher in bookings on CO2 systems. It's just a question of whether we can get them from forecasting to orders in Q4 or not. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. But it's coming in the next couple of quarters, just a question of when. Richard Tobin : Yes. Andy Kaplowitz : Helpful. Thanks, Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : And our final question comes from Mike Halloran from Baird. Mike Halloran : Good morning, everyone. Richard Tobin : Good morning. Mike Halloran : So, of couple quick -- couple of quick ones. Just on the comment of managing capacity utilization, I don't think this is of the scale that you would have talked about fourth quarter last year. Is this just tied to the heat exchanger piece? Or is there anything broader? and any comments on inventory levels in the channel? Richard Tobin : Yes. Overall, we'd like to maximize cash flow in Q4. And then depending on how we are in terms of backlog and the delivery assumptions that backlog, if we believe can push production performance in January out of Q4, it's prudent to do so at the end of the day, right, because it flexes up cash flow and it preserves fixed cost absorption into next year. So, we'll do that in select businesses in Q4, and that's why we're kind of happy about the results in Q3 because it buys us the room to do that because we don't want to be like trying to protect margin in Q4 by building inventory, right? So it's not nearly what it was back in the beginning of the destocking days where we consciously made a decision to do that across the wider portfolio. This is a more selective comment. Mike Halloran : Makes sense. And not beating a dead horse here. I just want to make sure I understand. The 25% margin comments for DCF, that was applicable to the whole segment, not just the gas piece or something more insular exiting 2025? Richard Tobin : The whole segment. Mike Halloran : Quite a gem. Thank you. Appreciate it. Richard Tobin : Great. Thanks. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer period and Dover's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",

Speaking today are Richard Tobin, President and Chief Executive Officer; Brad Cerepak, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Jack Dickens, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Also present today is Chris Woenker, Dover\u2019s Segment and Chief Financial Officer who will succeed Mr. Cerepak upon his retirement at the end of the month. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jack Dickens. Please go ahead, sir. Jack Dickens : Thank you, Margo. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. An audio version of the call will be available on our website through February 20th, and a replay link of the webcast will be archived for 90 days. Our comments today will include forward-looking statements based on current expectations. Actual results and events could differ from those statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, which are discussed in our SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements. With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks, Jack. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Page 3. Overall, we are encouraged by the fourth quarter. Top line performance was broad-based with four out of five segments posting positive organic growth unsold underlying demand across the portfolio. Bookings were up 7% organically in the quarter driven by robust order rates and our secular growth exposed markets as well as positive inflection and several end markets that have tough comps during the year. Our bookings strength validates our previous demand outlook for 2025. Segment margin performance for the quarter was solid at 22.2%, up 60 basis points over the prior year. We are quite encouraged by the product mix impact and prior period fixed cost restructuring on segment margins during the quarter. We expect this to be a precursor of the strong incremental margin performance that we expect in 2025. Excluding the $0.25 of tax reorganization benefit to our effective tax rate in fourth quarter of the prior year Q4 adjusted EPS grew 14% in the quarter and was up 8% for the full year. Our operational results were complemented by our ongoing portfolio actions. We recently closed two bolt on acquisitions within our high priority pumps and process solutions segment and our acquisition pipeline remains robust. We ended the year with a significant cash position that provides us flexibility as we pursue value creating capital deployment to further expand our businesses in high growth, high margin priority platforms through organic investment and acquisitions. We are optimistic about 2025. Underlying demand strength has continued across the portfolio into January. We have significant runway for margin improvement through organic growth, positive mix benefits and numerous cost and performance levers. We have high confidence in Dover's attractive end market exposures, flexible business model and proven execution playbook. With this backdrop, we are poised to deliver double digit EPS growth in 2025 through a combination of accretive top line growth, margin improvement and value creating capital allocation. Let's skip to slide 5. Engineered Products was up 2% organically in the quarter on volume growth in vehicle service and fluid dispensing. Aerospace and defense was lower in the period due to shipment timing but still posted a record year on growing global demand for signal intelligence and electronic warfare solutions. Clean Energy & Fueling was up 8% organically in the quarter led by robust order rates and shipments within cryogenic and clean energy components as well as solid volume growth in retail fueling equipment. Our North American above ground fueling business is methodically building back the volumes from peak EMV cycle from several years ago. Importantly, there was notable growth inflection in mix, accretive vehicle wash and below ground retail fueling in the quarter which had faced tough market conditions over the last two years. Margin was up 200 basis points in the quarter on positive volume leverage, attractive mix and operational execution. We expect these trends to continue to drive margins higher in 2025. Imaging & Identification posted another solid quarter with growth in core marketing, coating, printers, consumable services and aftermarket parts. Margin performance was robust as management actions on cost to serve and structural cost controls continued to drive incremental margins higher. Pumps & Process Solutions was up 3% organically on robust shipments in single use biopharma components and thermal connectors, both of which posted year-over-year bookings growth in excess of 100% in the quarter. Precision components and industrial pumps had solid results as well as forecasted. The long cycle polymer processing equipment was down year-over-year in the period but was flat sequentially. Segment revenue mix drove 230 basis points of margin improvement on excellent production performance on volume growth in biopharma and thermal and margin mix benefits from the FW Murphy acquisition. Revenue was down in the quarter in climate sustainability technologies and expected declines in European heat exchanges and beverage making can making equipment which more than offset the record quarterly volume in U.S. CO2 refrigeration systems and growth in heat exchangers in the U.S. and Asia. Our shipments of heat exchangers for heat pumps in Europe did improve sequentially in the quarter, a trend we expect to accelerate in the back half of 2025 as the end market recovers. Organic bookings were up 16% in the quarter with positive booking momentum across each operating business with particular strength in CO2 systems. I'll pass it to Brad here. Brad Cerepak : Thanks Rich. Good morning everyone. Let's go to our cash flow statement on slide 6. Adjusting for taxes paid on the gains on dispositions which are non-operational in nature, our free cash flow was $429 million in the quarter or 22% of revenue. Our fourth quarter was our highest cash flow quarter of the year in line with historical trends. We are pleased with our full year adjusted free cash flow generation which came in at 13.5% of revenue within our guidance range despite carrying large accounts receivable balances at the year end. That will be a credit to early 2025 cash generation. Our guidance for 2025 free cash flow is 14% to 16% of revenue on strong conversion of operating cash flow. We are forecasting slightly higher CapEx in 2025 on several growth investments. With that, I'll turn it back to Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks. I'm on slide 7. Here we provide a little more detail on the bookings momentum in the fourth quarter. Q4 marked our fifth consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year bookings growth posting a book-to-bill above one. As shown in the segment detail on the right, the bookings rates were broad based with particular strength in our secular growth exposed markets, providing a strong foundation as we move into 2025. Slide 8 highlights several end markets that were driving our consolidated organic growth forecast. Between end market data, our customer forecasts and our own booking rates, we are encouraged with the outlook in the broader industrial gas complex within Clean Energy & Precision Components, single use biopharma components, CO2 refrigeration systems and inputs into liquid cooling applications of data centers which include our connectors as well as heat exchangers. We have made significant organic and inorganic investment behind these end markets which will continue to prioritize into 2025. In aggregate, these markets now account for 20% of our portfolio and drive attractive margin accretion on expected double digit growth rates. Moving to Slide 9, we expect Engineered Products to grow low single digits organically on sustained strong orders and shipments within aerospace and defense which should be levered to the second half of the year due to the timing of government programs. With the divestitures of De-Sta-Co and Environmental Service Solutions Group in 2024, our Engineered Products segment now accounts for roughly 15% of our total portfolio down from 25% in the prior year. We are optimistic about the growth outlook in Clean Energy & Fueling which should return to positive volume growth due to strength in Clean Energy components, fluid transport and above ground fueling. We expect this segment to be among the leaders in margin accretion in 2025 on volume leverage positive mix from below ground fueling. Additionally, we can expect additional carryover of multiyear restructuring actions and acquisition integration benefits which will primarily accrue in the second half of the year. We expect Imaging ID to continue its long-term steady growth trajectory given its significant reoccurring revenue base and solid demand profile across all geographies. Management has done yeoman's work to improve the margin here through productivity and structural cost controls and we believe there are multiple years ahead of continued margin accretion. Underlying demand trends across Pumps & Process Solutions remain solid. Shipments of single use biopharma components should continue their double digit growth rate driven by production growth in blockbuster drugs and the emergence of novel technologies such as cell and gene therapies and the continued secular shift towards single use manufacturing. The outlook for thermal connectors for liquid cooling data centers is robust. Our preemptive capacity expansion has allowed us to maintain industry best lead times in what has turned out to be a short cycle business. Our precision components business is directly levered to energy complex investments, so we are quite interested to see how that plays out in 2025. Finally, climate and sustainability technology should recover well as difficult comps roll off in heat exchangers and beverage can making with the recent launch of our high capacity platform and CO2 refrigeration systems, we have the broadest product offering in the industry. We are currently taking orders well into the second half of 2025 and should continue to grow at double digit rate due to the broad based adoption of among national retailers. Heat Exchanger expected to grow as European heat foam channel inventories have been largely depleted, we are forecasting sustained growth in North American heat exchanger. We have completed a capacity expansion for large format production driven in part by liquid cooling applications in data centers. Our guidance, [ph] let me finish up on slide 10. Our guidance this year is a bit unique since we provided preliminary outlook for 2025 during last quarter's earnings release which we felt was necessary given the significant portfolio moves completed in Q4. Our 2025 guidance is in line that preliminary outlook from a quarter ago in terms of organic revenue and EPS growth with the underlying building blocks intact. There has only been one noteworthy change from last quarter which is heightened foreign exchange translation headwind from the strengthening U.S. dollar. While this incremental headwind which is by no means unique to Dover, we are confident in holding our full year guide due to the positive and broad based bookings momentum we had during the year. So pretty much we're going to eat everything that we saw when we ran from October to January in terms of FX which is not a little bit. We entered 2025 in advantaged cash position. Our preference is to deploy capital towards organic growth investments and our inorganic growth pipeline which has improved in both quantity and quality of opportunities over the last several months. Rest assured we will proceed with the capital discipline that we have demonstrated in the past. Finally, before we move to Q&A, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and congratulate Brad on his retirement. Since joining Dover over 15 years ago, he has been instrumental strategic and financial leader who has helped transform Dover to our current operating structure today. I'm sure Brad couldn't think of a better send off than to spend his last days preparing for this earnings call. On behalf of all of us, thank you and we wish you all the best. Brad Cerepak : Thank you for that Rich. Much appreciated. It's been absolutely a pleasure to work with you, the entire Dover team, our board and of course the finance organization for so many years. Chris Winkler will take it from here and I wish him the very best. Okay, I think we can go to Q&A here, Jack. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll now take our first question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning. Brad, congrats and thanks for all the help over the years. You've definitely seen a lot there, a lot of change. So congrats on the run. The slide last quarter talked about 40% conversion and $25 million of restructuring benefits. This slide says 40% plus. Are you still assuming the $25 million of restructuring benefits? I don't know. There's a lot of up arrows on that margin slide. So just maybe help calibrate us a bit on the margin drivers and price cost. Brad Cerepak : Sure. Like the restructuring benefit hasn't changed. As I mentioned last quarter we've got some more in the pipe and when we do it, we'll give you the roll forward benefit of it which is not embedded into our forecast presently. The balance of it is mix. So if you look at the margin accretion that we saw in Q4, I think it's a pretty good precursor of what we can expect and then we'll see from there. Then it's just a question of kind of the volume that we see. So right now we're going to stick to the 40 I think. I don't see that going up in a percentage basis. It will be more tied to are we underestimating the revenue growth potential in the 2025? Bookings look great, but let's see, let's get through a quarter or two. Steve Tusa : Got it. And price cost, what do you guys assume for price on the year and will that spread be positive? Brad Cerepak : It will be positive. Not a lot either way in terms of benefit, point, point and a half. We'll see. It depends on the mix that we get, but it will be positive. Steve Tusa : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Thanks again, Brad. Congrats. Operator : Thank you. And next we'll take a question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, Brad. I'm sure you're going to get a lot of congratulations and all that, but you've been at Dover for a long time. You've been the one sort of constant for the last 15 years. So it's quite a moment here. So congratulations. Brad Cerepak : Thank you. Thank you so much. Nigel Coe : No, no, Rich, you mentioned January and whenever you mention sort of current within the current period, it always sparks a bit of attention. I'm just curious if you think that tariffs or the potential for tariffs is causing any sort of unusual behavior around the supply chain that you touch? Richard Tobin : No, we don't see it. I mean we're generally speaking a proximity manufacturer. So our backlogs are more influenced on the lead times of the individual products which are kind of all over the place between the short cycle and the long cycle. No, we don't see any. Let's get in front of this because we think that there's going to be tariffs. We have a few businesses that are global in nature, but the vast majority of it is proximity. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then just a quick question on the margin outlook. You mentioned CEF is going to be the margin leader. I'm just curious if we could just maybe just. If I could just ask if the 20% plus handle would be reasonable there, just based on what we saw this quarter. And then similar vein with DPPS, just given the exit rate, would a 30 handle be reasonable for this year? Richard Tobin : Look, I think that the absolute change in margin we would expect in DCEF, we are driving at the segment level in excess of 20. All right. You may not get it every quarter depending on the cyclicality of it, but clearly at an exit rate in excess of 20 on DPPS, it's all about the mix. So if we're under calling Biopharma and we get better results there, that clearly that will mix up. But, if Precision Components does better, it's a little bit dilutive, but it's still at 25% margin so we'll take it all day long. So it's more a question of what we get in terms of mix going from here. Nigel Coe : Okay, fair enough. Thanks, Rich. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. We'll next go to Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning everyone. Brad Cerepak : Hi Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Brad, thanks for all your help. Congrats. Brad Cerepak : Thank you. Andy Kaplowitz : Rich. Thank you. Book-to-bill over one again in Q4. Are you thinking 2025 is another year where all or most of your quarters could achieve book-to-bill out or over one? And I know you're expecting an inflection in CO2 orders. It looks like you got that. And you mentioned the double digit expected growth in that business is expected to continue. But given recovery in other DCST businesses, at least in terms of orders, it seems like you expect DCST bookings momentum to continue. Maybe you can comment on that specifically. Richard Tobin : Yes, I mean I would expect based on our growth rate, we'll hover around one. I mean, I don't think we get all excited if it's 0.981 quarter but we should hover around 1 for the year and then we'll make a call on Q4 as we exit. Yes, I mean, we did get some bookings in Q4 in CO2 systems. We've got a lot coming our way, so I would expect bookings to look good there. Coupled with the fact maybe not in Q1, but as we go into Q2, we'll inflect positive bookings in Heat Exchanger. So that will help in terms of effect. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. And then can you give us a little more color into how you think about earnings cadence through the year? It seems like we start out pretty slowly in terms of organic growth in Q1 given DCST and DP could start slowly in terms of growth, but more color on Q1 and the trajectory for the rest of the year would be helpful. Richard Tobin : Yes, I mean, it'll go back to, now that we're beyond kind of all the COVID stuff and we'll go back to, we'll start off a little slowly. We'll probably build a bunch of inventory in Q1 that will recognize those revenues in Q2 and Q3. And then Q4, like every other year, we'll decide on the outlook of 2025, how we run production, but we'll make those decisions in the August, September timeframe. So, yes, I mean, I think that. I think quarter to quarter will look okay, but I mean, it will be a ramp into Q2 and Q3. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And we're next going to take our next question from Joe Richie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Hey, guys, good morning. And Brad, thanks so much. Wishing you nothing but the best. Brad Cerepak : Thank you. Joe Ritchie : Maybe let's just. I'll just hone my questions in on DCST. Rich, maybe talk a little bit about like what you're seeing in that European heat pump market now expecting, growth in 2025. I think you maybe mentioned inventories have also stabilized there. Just give us some color on what you're seeing there. Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, the margin performance that you see for us in Q4 is us basically under producing severely. So it was a willful attempt to force inventory clearing out of the channel. But having said that, orders inflected positively, let's not get excited off of some pretty low levels. So I would say that we did our part to allow inventory to clear and just sequentially orders are coming up. It's probably still got a bad comp in Q1, but then from there we would expect to ramp over the balance of the year. What that ramp looks like we're taking our best estimates right now. As you know, getting good data out of out of our own customers has been quite difficult. But we would expect, I think that we've got a prudent outlook for it and hopefully it gets sequentially better over the year. But what we're confident about is we took some direct action to allow inventory to clear in the back half of the year. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That makes a lot of sense. So as you think about then kind of like the rates starting point for margins for that segment, given that you took that big hit in the fourth quarter, how do you think about then the margin trajectory in 2025? It would seem like you should get some pretty good margin expansion in that business. Richard Tobin : Yes, I mean once we lap Q1, Q1 is always a little bit messy because in traditional refrigeration equipment it's not a heavy shipment. We tend to build inventory there as opposed to shipping it. And as I said, SWEP on heat exchangers has probably got a tough comp there. Having said all that that we were very pleased with the margin that we got, the exit margin that we got of refrigeration. So that's what we're booking in for the balance of the year. And to the extent we under produce so severely in heat exchangers, we have like negative fixed cost absorption there in Q4. We'd expect that to get better over time. So net, net if you just look through the downturn in heat exchangers, with all the progress that we made on refrigeration, we would expect that we would be maybe not at record margins because I'd have to kind of triangulate for Belvac a little bit. But some very good margins in that segment if we were to benchmark it historically. Joe Ritchie : Great to hear. Thanks guys. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Brett Linzey : Thanks, good morning and best of luck to Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thank you. Brett Linzey : Hey I wanted to come back to the bio orders really strong. I guess any detail in the nature of the applications you're winning? And any concentration, is there 1 to 2 customers? Is it fairly broad-based? And then how should we think about that delivery schedule? Richard Tobin : It is broad-based. I mean, we cleared inventory in the back half -- or the front half of this year and then you started orders inflected and I think it more or less at the end of second quarter. We don't know a lot in terms of where it ends up because there's a big portion that's sell-through from our clients at the end of the day. But I think I would categorize it as -- we are a supplier to end-use production and that the inventory is cleared out of the system and that those units are operating now, and it's just pull through. Brett Linzey : It makes sense. And then just a follow-up on the liquid cooling, very strong demand, again, obviously, with everything that's going on. But maybe talk about that specification process with those partners. And how large has the total addressable market for Dover grown over the last couple of years? And where do you think your share of that can run? Richard Tobin : Well, it's grown significantly because it was a traditional product of ours that have been supplied into supercomputing applications. What the TAM is, is anybody's guess right now. If you go back and look at the transcript, I think that we made the right decision in terms of having the product available, and we made the right decision to build out the capacity in advance of the demand because it has turned out what I would have thought to be a business that would have because of the build-out time for these data centers that you would know when the orders are coming. It's turned out to be a very short cycle business for us. So the data that we get on where the product is going, is almost at the last minute. Now we've been a market share winner here because we've got the capacity installed to the detriment of some of the working capital, I would say, in the fourth quarter of this year, but I can't even give you TAM numbers, quite frankly. I don't think anybody knows. We'll see how it plays out. But right now, super proud of the management team in terms of how they've managed an incredibly complex situation. Brett Linzey : Appreciate the detail. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Halloran with Baird. Please go ahead. Michael Halloran : Hey good morning everyone. And congrats, Brad. Brad Cerepak : Thank you. Michael Halloran : So just another high-level question here. Just to make sure I understand the cadence through the year. And in answer to the earlier question, the thought process then if I think about typical earnings by quarter, relatively normal or a little subdued in the first and then build it up in the back. But then related, are you basically assuming the underlying demand dynamics are relatively stable with current levels, not improving, not getting worse, but relatively stable in normal sequentials? Is that the thought process? Richard Tobin : Yes. I think the sequential should be relatively stable and typically from a calendarization point of view. So there's nothing -- and the mix benefit should be relatively stable. But when we're talking about the incremental growth on the roll forward, then you're going to get the most of the growth in Q2 and Q3. So it doesn't leg down and then leg up. It kind of just sequentially rolls forward, the mix impact on the business should be relatively stable right? Because that's -- if you look at the order rates, that's what we're going to be shipping out of. And then the growth that we're getting, which we'll be producing in Q1 will be shipped out in Q2 and Q3. That's our estimates right now. Michael Halloran : Yes. That makes sense. And then just an update on the M&A side. Any change to what you're seeing from a backdrop, actionability and the amount of content that might be in the market at some point? Richard Tobin : Yes, lots of stuff coming. We're really interested to see what the spirits are out there and what -- we'd like to see a couple of transactions to get done. There's quite a few in the pipe to see at what -- how aggressive everybody is going to be at valuation. But those are the ones everybody knows about. We've also got a handful of very interesting proprietary deals that we're working on. So we'll see. I mean we're very popular in multi-industrial world because of all the cash that we're sitting on. So we're seeing a lot time will tell about what multiples look like when we see a couple of transactions. Brad Cerepak : Yes. And keep in mind that that cash on the balance sheet right now is not deployed in our forecast. It's generating nice interest income, so it doesn't earn a hole in our pocket, so to speak. And when you think about your models, just keep in mind that we're sticking to our year-over-year concept around interest income until we deploy that capital. And then you'll see a shift between the interest line and the segment performance line as we do deal flow. Michael Halloran : Thanks guys. Brad Cerepak : Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Thanks, good morning and Brad, thanks for all the help. If we think about just the segment level, I wanted to start with clean energy and fueling -- it seemed like you did see some very encouraging signs exiting the year in below ground and vehicle wash. And as we're thinking about the 2025 guidance, maybe help us understand kind of how much of the business now are you going to sort of come together fairly regrowth there differ this year versus the more traditional parts of DCEF. Richard Tobin : Okay. I'm going to have to go back and look, but I would think in terms of absolute profit, it is the largest contributor year-over-year, that segment. And that's a combination of restructuring benefits, growth mix on growth and acquisitions that we had done in the prior period that actually calendarized at 12 months. Breaking it into pieces, I think that we'll let Jack take you through it, but we had -- in terms of the cryogenic component exposure, we are significantly larger than our nearest competitor. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful, thank you. And then secondly, on engineered products, there's been a lot of change in the business mix there. Aerospace and Defense, a big old -- waiting now within DEP. And maybe remind us of kind of the main exposures there because it looks like the volumes there were down in the fourth quarter but should grow this year as a whole in DEP. Maybe kind of remind us sort of what's moving around in that? And what's the visibility on that second half improvement in the A&D shipments? Richard Tobin : The comp was bad in Q4, and that drove the commentary, which is timing of shipments, which I think that we had some pretty big shipments in Q4 of 2023. Having said that, the business is -- it's big as it's ever been in terms of its absolute size because we've actually been an acquirer in there. In terms of the calendarization, I'd have to go and work with Jack to see what 2025 looks like, but it is posted to grow year-over-year and having a positive margin mix benefit on that growth. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Sprague : Hey thanks, good morning everyone. Congrats, Brad admit, but we go back American Standard, Honeywell Allied. Brad Cerepak : I know, a lot of years, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Most the high school. Maybe a CFO question to start. Just on kind of interest income for that color. I assume rates are a little bit more favorable on sitting on cash than maybe you thought if you were thinking about the Fed maybe address it if that is, in fact, helpful. And then also, I just wanted to clarify, that guide that you're talking about is really only accounting for cash on hand. It doesn't look like you're giving yourself any credit for just a very solid free cash flow generation you're expecting in 2025? Brad Cerepak : No, I think it's inclusive. But we have uses of that cash flow like we normally do, right? So we'll have to see, it is volatile in the sense of how many rate cuts will there be next year? We model it out. And when I say we're sticking with our year-over-year that we guided back or gave insight into in the third quarter. It is all inclusive for sure. But capital deployment will impact it, Jeff, and there's a lot of variables. So I think at this stage, give us a quarter to sort it out and see how deals actually flow through, and then we'll be able to give you more insight into it. Jeffrey Sprague : And then Rich, on DII, just maybe a little bit more color there, right? Demand trends are giving us a solid green pie, but we're growing low single digit. I'm guessing it's just sort of the fashion fabric or whatever you call that piece of the business is really still lagging and holding back the base. Is that what's going on? Maybe a little more color there. Richard Tobin : It's just de minimis in terms of the revenue and earnings at this point. So we're not modeling in any kind of snapback in terms of performance. Credit to the management team, the margin accretion and has even lapped that business declining over the last 3 years through improving the profitability of the core Marketing and Coating business. As I mentioned in my comments, we've got some other efficiency programs, if you will, laid in for 2025 that should help the accretion there. So let's just call it on the textile stuff, the bottoming has taken place, but it's de minimis now in terms of the earnings of the group. Jeffrey Sprague : So the low single-digit growth just reflects then what's the normalization on the equipment side, after a little bit of a bumpy [indiscernible]. A - Richard Tobin : But this 1 has got a ton of FX in it, and it flops around between equipment and consumables. So we don't get all bent out of shape quarter-to-quarter. We look at this -- this business really on a full year basis. It grows 2% to 4% at the end of the day. So I wouldn't intra-quarter volatility is almost meaningless. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. I was talking about the outlook, but -- good to go. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Hi guys, good morning. Yes. We'll try and congrats Brad on his retirement. It was a pleasure. Thank you. Richard Tobin : Still saying we when he answers the question. Andrew Obin : I know. Richard Tobin : It's encouraging because... Andrew Obin : That's good. Richard Tobin : We're going to be here through capital deployment. Andrew Obin : I'm binge watching, severance, these days. So just 2025 outlook for growth in vehicle wash is much better than the commentary from peers, and I would also say above ground is turning. Do you think you're gaining share? Or is it a real turn in the market right? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, I got to be careful with the peer commentary in vehicle wash because a lot of them own distribution and operate sites. We don't. We're purely equipment manufacturer. I think the commentary around that it\u2019s gotten better, but it's not inflected super better, but even a little bit better on a margin point of view, it's positive. I think the real material inflection that we're seeing there if we take the cryogenic side and put it aside, is the mix impact -- a couple of things. The mix impact below ground, which has been pretty depressed for 2 years or 3 years now, which is highly margin accretive. That's good. A lot of the restructuring we did last year is in this particular segment. So that's where the flow-through comes in, which is good. And then the cryogenic piece, I talked about at length into Q3. That we -- we're going to go through a big integration year here and expect to get the integration benefits of those prior period acquisitions, probably levered towards the second half of this year. So it's got a lot of kind of non-revenue benefit under number one and number two, mix is improving. Andrew Obin : Excellent, thank you for an extensive answer. And just a simple question for Colder [ph]. Do you think that business can double this year given sort of the underlying growth in liquid cooling? Richard Tobin : Well, I mean, double relative to what, right? Biopharma. Andrew Obin : Relative to 2024. No, just sorry, just the liquid cooling part, sorry. Just the data center. Yes, the data center part, sorry. Richard Tobin : Could it? Yes. We'll see. As I mentioned before, it's just turned out to be such a short-cycle business that we've got -- we get a view of maybe 45 days in terms of the demand cycle. So we'll see. But could it yes. Andrew Obin : Thank you. It\u2019s good to have happy optimistic reach back. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hey good morning guys. And congrats. I'm sure you're going to miss that flight out on Monday morning or Sunday night or whatever in Chicago, but you spent some frequent or miles our way, I guess, probably have plenty. But anyways, I think you guys have covered most of the turn here. It's been a lot of minutia too. But if we back up a little bit is the refrigeration story just about CO2 in 2025? Or is it really also just about pent-up demand that there was a it's been a pretty long period, I think, of underinvestment from your customers. Is that a correct assessment? Richard Tobin : I think that's a correct assessment. But recall, we have capped our capacity in that particular segment. So it's more for us margin performance through productivity plus CO2. Okay, so we're not going to chase dilutive growth on the retail refrigeration side. So between CO2 product offering and specialty product offering will take as much as we can get there. On the case business, we'll see. We're in early innings now about the CO2 transformation of whether you can bundle the CO2 system with the case and what does that mean for margins? I think that is something that will unfold during 2025. Scott Davis : Fair enough. And then just a small question. I guess I've never asked this before, but if you had to split up your CapEx between kind of maintenance and growth, how would you think about what kind of that base level of maintenance CapEx is in the numbers? Richard Tobin : That\u2019s a good question. We used to give a little pie chart on that. I'm guessing that it's $40 million maintenance, but that does not include IT, and 60% growth. And if I had to carve out IT, I'd have to get back to you, Scott. Scott Davis : Okay thank you guys. That\u2019s a lot to share. Richard Tobin : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our last question will come from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you, good morning everyone. I get to do the last. Congrats to Brad and wish you and family all the best. And I also go way back. Brad Cerepak : I know we do. Deane Dray : Maybe we just start, Rich, on the 2 bolt-on deals, how do those come about where do they fit? What's kind of the attraction there? And how much of that pipeline that you're looking at fits that category? Richard Tobin : They're both proprietary. One is going in pumps and process solutions, and -- both of them are going to yes, all right. And they're both proprietary. One is cryogenics, but it actually ends up in our pumps business. The other business is a product line expansion for plastics and polymers for MAG. And that one, I think we've been working on for 3 years or so. Deane Dray : All right. Good to hear on that. And then data center came up a whole lot in the Q&A prepared remarks in your slides, my guess is those were already written prior to the Monday sell-off. And Rich, you've already said your short-cycle business, it's 45 days, so you're probably not looking any for out than that. But just in terms of managing this business, do you feel like there's any sea change in terms of data center CapEx. And I know you can't size the TAM, but is the TAM potentially getting smaller and more competition? Just kind of how might the competitive dynamics have changed since Monday? Richard Tobin : Deane, I don't know. I mean the fact of the matter is in terms of the total TAM, we're rounding error. We think that we've got a very good product that we have IP protected. I think that we were first in line in terms of building out the capacity, and that's pretty much what's driven the volume growth that we've seen. I think we've been pretty prudent in terms of sizing the business. So we're not looking at the billions and billions of dollars, and trying to do the mathematics of gigawatts to connectors. I mean, many have tried, all have failed. So I'm not overly worried about it at the end of the day. I think there's enough kind of shovels in the ground that makes us feel comfortable with our 2025 forecast. Deane Dray : Thanks a lot. Appreciate that color. Thanks. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer period of Dover's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.",
