And welcome to the Ford first quarter earnings conference call. My name is Towanda, and I will be your coordinator for today. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. George Sharp, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. George Sharp : Thank you, Towanda, and good morning. Welcome to everyone joining us today either by phone or by webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning, so we can provide you with additional details of our first quarter 2014 financial results. Presenting today are Alan Mulally, President and CEO of Ford; and Bob Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Mark Fields, Chief Operating Officer; Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO. Copies of this morning's press release and presentation slides are available on Ford's Investor and Media website. Please note that the financial results discussed today are preliminary and include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q and any non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck. Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation and detailed in our SEC filings. With that, I'd now like to turn the presentation over to Alan. Alan Mulally : Thank you, George, and good morning to everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity today to review our first quarter 2014 business performance, as we continue to move forward with the implementation of our One Ford plan. Let's get started and turn to the first slide, please. Our One Ford plan shown here continues to guide everything that we do. We continue to aggressively restructure the business to operate profitably at the current demand and the changing model mix. Accelerate development of the new products our customers want and value. Finance our plan and improve our balance sheet. And work together effectively, as one team, leveraging our global assets. Our commitment remains to serve customers in all markets with a full family of best-in-class vehicles, small, medium and large; cars, utilities and trucks, delivering profitable growth for all. Now, let's turn to Slide 2 to review a summary of our first quarter accomplishments. The company achieved its 19th consecutive profitable quarter in the first quarter with a positive operating-related cash flow and continued strong liquidity. Once again, the topline grew with wholesale volume of 6% from year ago and company revenue improving about 1%. We saw a higher market share in Asia-Pacific, where we achieved a record share in China. Among our business units, Asia-Pacific reported a record quarterly profit. North America, Middle East and Africa we're profitable and Ford Credit once again delivered solid results. Europe reduced its loss substantially compared with last year, but South America incurred a larger loss. This year we'll feature the most product launches in our history and we remain on track with the 23 global product launches we announced late last year. Overall, the company's results were solid, but the quarter was impacted adversely by several significant factors that are not representative of the underlying run rate of our business. Based on our solid start, we continue to expect the company's full year pre-tax profit to range from $7 billion to $8 billion. Our outlook for automotive revenue, operating margin and operating-related cash flow also remains unchanged. Before turning to the financial details, let's recap some of our other achievements from the first quarter. As shown on Slide 3, we revealed several concepts and products in the first quarter, including the all new 2015 F-150, Figo and Ka four-door concepts. The new 2015 Focus five-door and Wagon, and the new 2015 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator. We accelerate the momentum of our global transit line with the launch of the two-ton transit in Europe, the Transit Connect in U.S. and Canada and the Transit Custom in Australia. In Asia-Pacific, we expanded production of EcoSport to Thailand, making it the fourth plant globally to build the all new Urban SUV. We announced an investment of $168 million at our Ohio Assembly plant for production of the all new 2016 F-650 and F-750 medium-duty trucks, beginning in spring of 2015. Also in the U.S., we announced an investment of $580 million in additional 650 jobs to build a new 2.7-liter EcoBoost engine Lima Engine Plant in Ohio to increase production of Super Duty and Kentucky Truck. We also announced new automated driving research projects with MIT and Stanford University, as well as expansion of our Research and Engineering Center in Nanjing, China. And finally, in January, we increased our quarterly dividend by 25%, the second increase since restoring the dividend in January of 2012. Now, Bob Shanks will now take you through the details of our first quarter financial results. Robert Shanks : Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Starting at the top on Slide 4, first quarter wholesale volume was 1.6 million units, up 92,000 units from a year ago. And revenue was $35.9 billion, up $300 million. Pre-tax profit was $1.4 billion, excluding special items $765 million lower than a year ago. After-tax earnings per share at $0.25 were $0.16 lower. Net income attributable to Ford, including pre-tax special item charges of $122 million was $989 million, which was $622 million lower than a year ago. Earnings were $0.24 a share, down $0.16. The pre-tax special item charges of a $122 million are for separation-related actions, primarily in Europe to support our transformation plan. You can find additional detail on Appendix 3. Automotive operating-related cash flow was $1.2 billion, our 16th consecutive quarter of positive performance. And automotive gross cash was $25.2 billion, exceeding debt by $9.5 billion. Our first quarter operating effective tax rate, which isn't shown was 38%. Consistent with prior guidance, we expect our full year operating effective tax rate to be about 35%. As shown on Slide 5, both of our sectors, automotive and financial services, contributed to the company's first quarter pre-tax profit. As shown in the memo, the year-over-year decline in company first quarter pre-tax profit is explained primarily by the automotive sector. Within automotive, lower results in North and South America were offset partially by an improvement of nearly $600 million from the other automotive regions. Compared with the fourth quarter 2013, company pre-tax profit was $63 million higher, more than explained by financial services. The key market factors and financial metrics for our automotive business in the first quarter are shown on Slide 6. Continuing this quarter, we will report global and total regional industry SAAR and market share data to improve transparency and reflect the markets covered by each of our automotive business units. As you can see on the far left and as already mentioned, wholesale volume increased by 6% compared with a year ago. Automotive revenue on the other hand was unchanged. The higher volume is more than explained by higher industry-volumes in all regions except South America, improved market share in Asia Pacific and a favorable change in dealer stocks. Global industry SAAR is estimated at 86.5 million units, up over 3% from a year ago. Ford global market share is estimated at 6.9% unchanged from a year ago. Operating margin was 3.4%, down 1.8 percentage points from a year ago, and automotive pre-tax profit was $919 million, down $724 million. Lower results in North and South America more than explained the change in both metrics. As mentioned the first quarter results include several significant adverse factors that we do not consider to be representative of the underlying run rate of our business that is shown here on Slide 7. In North America, these factors total about $500 million. They include a $400 million increase in warranty reserves for field service actions, which include safety recalls and other product campaign related to 2008 through 2013 models as well as expense for 2001 through 2005 model vehicles. We also experienced premium freight and labor cost of about $100 million during the quarter related to harsh winter weather in the U.S., which disrupted our operations as well as those of many of our suppliers. In South America, we saw significant currency devaluations across our major markets during the quarter. These are shown in Appendix 12. In addition to the operating effect of these exchange rate movements, we recorded charges of about $400 million related to the one-time balance sheet impact of these changes. Included is $310 million related to the Venezuelan Bolivar. In total, these factors reduced pre-tax profit by about $900 million for the equivalent of $0.17 per share. They also account for a year-over-year decline in company pre-tax profit of $700 million as shown in the memo. While similar factors could occur in the future, it's unusual for items like these to occur in this magnitude in the same quarter. Isolating these factors, provides a better understanding of what we believe to be the underlying run rate of the company and our North and South America business units. Slide 8 shows the factors that contributed to the $724 million decline in automotive first quarter pre-tax profit, including the items just reviewed on the prior slide. The year-over-year decline in automotive pre-tax profit can be explained fully by the warranty and premium weather-related cost in the North America and the balance sheet exchange effects in South America. All other factors effectively offset one another. Slide 9 shows the first quarter pre-tax results for each of our automotive operations as well as other automotive. Effective with this quarter, we're reporting results for Middle East and Africa, our new business unit that was formed to facilitate an increased focus on this important growth region. To allow comparison, we've revised prior year financials and physicals for each of our other business units to align with this new reporting structure. Total automotive sector bottomline reporting, of course, is not impacted by this change. You can find detail on the revisions and appendices '14 through '16. As you can see, North America reported a solid first quarter result, notwithstanding the factors discussed earlier, while Asia-Pacific's profit was a record for any quarter. Europe cut its loss by more than half from a year ago and by nearly two-thirds from fourth quarter 2013. The automotive operations outside North America improved $265 million from a year ago, notwithstanding the larger loss in South America, mainly due to the factors discussed earlier. The change in other automotive from a year is more than explained by unfavorable fair value adjustment of our investment in Mazda. For the full year, we now expect net interest expense to be about $700 million, a $100 million improvement from our prior guidance, reflecting higher interest income. Now we'll look at each of the regions within the automotive sector, staring on Slide 10 with North America. North America's first quarter pre-tax profit continue to be driven by robust industry sales, our strong product line up, continued discipline in matching production to demand and a lean cost structure, even as we continue to invest for future growth. North America wholesale volume and revenue declined 2% and 5% respectively in the first quarter. The volume decrease is more than explained by lower market share. This was offset in part by higher industry sales, including the U.S. SAAR of 16 million units that was 400,000 units higher than a year ago and a favorable change in dealer stocks. The decline in revenue mainly reflects the lower wholesale volume as well as unfavorable mix, lower net pricing and the adverse effect of a weaker Canadian dollar. North America operating margin was 7.3%, down 3.8 percentage points from last year and pre-tax profit was $1.5 billion, about $900 million lower than last year's record profit. The adverse impact of $500 million associated with the warranty of reserve and weather-related premium cost, as noted earlier, is worth 2.5 percentage points of operating margin. On Slide 11, we show the factors that contributed to North America's first quarter decline and pre-tax profit from last year. The deterioration is more than explained by unfavorable market factors and higher cost. The unfavorable volume in mix is explained primarily by planned reductions in daily rental sales and lower small car share, as well as unfavorable series mix and option take rates ahead of the launch of our new products. Net pricing is lower, mainly due to Fusion and Escape, which had very low levels of incentives a year ago due to the launch of these models. The higher costs are more than explained by the unfavorable $500 million related to the factors previously discussed. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was lower than in first quarter 2013 more than explained by unfavorable market factors, including higher incentive spending, unfavorable product mix and lower industry volume. Ford's U.S. market share trends are shown on Slide 12. Starting with the left chart, our total U.S. market share was 15.3% in the first quarter, down six-tenths-of-a-percentage point from a year ago, reflecting planned reductions in daily rental sales and lower small car retail share. Total F-Series share was unchanged from a year ago. Compared with the fourth quarter, our market share was down one-tenth of a percentage point. As shown in the right chart, our retail market share of the retail industry was 13.5% in the first quarter, down five-tenths-of-a-percentage point from last year, explained primarily by lower small car segmentation and share performance as well as F-Series. F-Series results reflect our disciplined approach to incentive spending, as we manage inventory ahead of the launch of the new F-150. Compared with the fourth quarter, our retail market share was down two-tenths-of-a-percentage point with losses on F-Series offset partially by Fusion and Escape. F-Series results reflect our disciplined incentive strategy as well as seasonal full-sized pickup segmentation trends. Turning to our full year guidance for North America, we continue to expect pre-tax profit to be lower than last year and operating margin to range from 8% to 9%. Now, let's turn to Slide 13, and we review South America, where we're continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product line up and progressively replacing legacy products with global One Ford offerings. Now, however, we're also dealing with slower GDP growth in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation along with political and social turmoil in some countries. In the first quarter, wholesale volume and revenue decreased from a year ago by 8% and 18%, respectively. The lower volume is more than explained by a 200,000 unit decline from last year's SAAR of 5.9 million units. This includes the impact of import restrictions in Argentina and lower production in Venezuela, resulting from limited availability of U.S. dollars. The revenue decline is explained primarily by unfavorable exchange and unfavorable volume and mix, offset partially by higher net pricing. Operating margin was negative 27%, down significantly and pre-tax loss was $510 million, a deterioration of $292 million. The balance sheet exchange effects discussed earlier account for about 75% of a quarterly loss. On Slide 14, we show the factors causing a decline in South America's first quarter pre-tax result from a year ago. The decline is explain by unfavorable exchange, higher cost, mainly associated with economics-related effects caused by high local inflation and lower volume, mainly due to the weaker industry. Although net pricing was substantial, including some pricing associated with new products, it was not enough to offset the currency and inflation-related effects. As shown in the memo, pre-tax results deteriorated compared with first quarter 2013, more than explained by unfavorable exchange. For the full year, we now expect South America to incur a larger loss than in 2013. Based on our present assumptions, we expect rest of the year to be about breakeven to a small loss. Let's turn now to Europe, beginning on Slide 15, where we continue to implement our transformation plan and remain on track to achieve profitability in 2015. Europe's wholesale volume and revenue improved from a year ago, up 11% and 18%, respectively. The volume increase is more than explained by higher industry volumes, reflecting a SAAR of 14.5 million units for the Europe 20 markets, up over 1 million units as well as favorable changes in dealer stocks and higher market share for Europe 20. The increase in revenue mainly reflects the higher volume and favorable exchange. Europe's operating margin was a negative 2.5%, an improvement of 4 percentage points from a year ago and the pre-tax loss was $194 million, a $231 million improvement. The first quarter loss includes $76 million of restructuring cost. Slide 16 shows the factors that contributed to the improvement in Europe's first quarter pre-tax results from a year ago. The improvement reflects lower cost, favorable market factors and favorable exchange. This was offset partially by lower joint venture results and royalties in Russia and Turkey, included in other. As shown in the memo below the chart, pre-tax results improved compared with first quarter 2013 with most factors favorable. Our European market share trends are shown on Slide 17. Starting with the left chart, our total first quarter market share for Europe 20 was 8%, up three-tenths-of-a-percentage point from a year ago, reflecting improved share from Mondeo and Kuga. Although, not shown on the chart, the commercial vehicle share also improved in the first quarter driven by the new Transit Connect, as we continue to rollout our all new commercial vehicle range. As shown in the right chart, our passenger car share of the retail segment of the five major European markets was 8.3% in the first quarter, down one-tenth-of-a-percentage point from the same period last year. Lower share reflects adverse segmentation changes, offset partially by improved performance for Fiesta and Kuga. We continue to focus on the quality of our market share and improving our sales channel mix, achieving a higher share of the fleet segment in the first quarter. We're very pleased with the start to the year by our operations in Europe and the progress the team continues to make in implementing our transformation plan, notwithstanding external headwinds in Russia and Turkey. As a result, our full year guidance for Europe is unchanged. We expect results to improve compared with 2013. Let's now turn to Middle East and Africa on Slide 18. In the first quarter, we wholesaled 51,000 vehicles in the region, 3,000 pure units a year ago. Revenue was $1.2 billion, a $100 million lower. The lower volume reflects lower dealer stock increases. The lower revenue was more than explained by the lower volume and unfavorable exchange, primarily due to a weaker South African rand. Operating margin was 4.7%, up 1 percentage point from a year ago and pre-tax profit was $54 million, up $7 million. Our full year guidance for Middle-East and Africa remains unchanged. We expect resulted to be about breakeven. Let's now review Asia-Pacific on Slide 19. Our strategy in Asia-Pacific continues to be to grow aggressively with an expanding portfolio of One Ford products with manufacturing hubs in China, India and ASEAN. As shown on the left, first quarter wholesale volume was up 32% and net revenue, which excludes our China joint ventures, grew 19%. Our China wholesale volume not shown was up 45% in the quarter. The higher volume in the region reflects mainly improved market share. The higher industry volume also contributed. We estimate the first quarter SAAR for the region at 38.9 million units, up 1.9 million units from a year ago, wholly explained by China. Our first quarter market share was 3.4%, seven-tenth-of-a-percentage point higher than a year ago. This was driven by China, where our market share improved nine-tenths-of-a-percentage point to a record 4.5%, reflecting continued strong sales at EcoSport, Kuga and Mondeo. Asia Pacific's higher revenue is more than explained by favorable mix and the higher volume. Operating margin was 11.1%, up 12.4 percentage points from a year ago, and pre-tax profit was $291 million, up $319 million. Strong results in China drove the region's record profit. The improvement in Asia Pacific's first quarter pre-tax profit from a year ago was explained on Slide 20. For the region, the improvement in profitability is more than explained by favorable volume and mix and the higher royalties from our joint ventures included in other. Higher costs including investment for future growth were a partial offset. As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific pre-tax results improved from fourth quarter 2013, explained primarily by lower cost. For the full year, we now expect Asia Pacific to earn a higher pre-tax profit than the year ago, improved from our prior guidance of about even. Let's turn now to Ford Credit, which remains, key to our global growth strategy providing world-class dealer in customer financial services, maintaining a strong balance sheet and producing solid profits and distributions. Slide 21 shows the factors that contributed to the largely unchanged result from a year ago. Higher volume, reflecting increases in nearly all products globally was largely offset by unfavorable residual performance in North America. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was higher than in fourth quarter 2013, explained primarily by favorable lease residual performance as well as lower operating cost included in other. These changes are consistent with normal seasonality. For the full year, we now expect Ford Credit pre-tax profit to be about equal to higher than 2013. This reflects improved financing margin performance. Our guidance for Ford Credit managed receivables and managed leverage and distributions to its parent is unchanged. Next on Slide 22 is our automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $25.2 billion, $400 million higher than yearend 2013. Automotive operating related cash flow was $1.2 billion with favorable changes in working capital and automotive profit offset partially by unfavorable timing and other differences as well as net spending. During the quarter, we contributed $500 million to our global funded pension plans, down substantially from the last two years due to the recent improvements in the funded status of plans. Dividends paid in the quarter totaled about $500 million. Slide 23 shows that automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.7 billion, unchanged from yearend 2013. We ended the quarter with net cash of $9.5 and automotive liquidity of $36.6 billion, both $4 million higher than yearend 2013. Although, not yet included in our total liquidity, we are in process of amending and extending our corporate revolving credit facility. The facility which is presently $10.7 billion is expected to grow to about $12 billion. This will provide the company with additional liquidity as we expand our business globally and continues to show the great support we have from our global and growing bank group for the One Ford plan. Consistent with our capital and funding strategy, we've planned to allocate $2 billion to Ford Credit to support this liquidity. We expect to close this transaction later this month and will provide details in our first quarter 10-Q filing. This concludes our review of the financial details on our first quarter earnings. So with that I'd now like to turn it back to Alan who'll take us through our 2014 outlook for the business environment as well as our 2014 planning assumptions and key metrics. Alan? Alan Mulally : Thank you, Bob. Slide 24 summarizes our view of the business environment for 2014. We project global economic growth to be in the 2.5% to 3% range and global industry sales to be about 85 million to 90 million units. U.S. economic growth is projected to be in the 2.5% to 3% range, with industry sales still supported by replacement demand as a result of the older age of vehicles on the road. Near-term conditions have shown signs of improvement after some weakness in January and February data. In South America, Brazil's economy is slowing due to high interest rates put in place to contain inflation. While the situation in Argentina and Venezuela remains volatile, with both economies facing unclear economic policy direction. In Europe, an economic recovery is underway. For 2014, we expect GDP growth of about 1% in the euro area and 2% to 2.5% in the U.K. The European Central Bank left its policy interest rate unchanged at 0.75% in April and indicated that it will keep rates low for an extended period. The Bank of England also indicated that it will keep rates low until economic growth reduces excess capacity in U.K. economy. And in Asia-Pacific, China's economic growth is expected to be slightly below 7.5% with several challenges, including excess capacity and excess debt. The government intends to be more focused on structural reforms and is willing to accept lower growth within a reasonable range of 7.5%. Growth in India is expected to improve modestly to about 5% from last year, as high inflation and high interest rates remain impediments to stronger growth. Overall, despite challenges in emerging markets, we expect global economic growth to continue in 2014. Slide 25, recaps the guidance disclosed earlier for all of our business units as well as for net interest expense. Other than South America, the guidance has improved or unchanged. Our company guidance for 2014 is detailed on Slide 26. We continue to expect full year industry volume to range from 16 million to 17 million units in the U.S. and China to range from 22.5 million to 24.5 million units. We now expect Europe 20 markets to be in the 14 million to 15 million unit range, reflecting improved economic growth prospects and replacement demand. In terms of our finance performance, we continue to expect automotive revenue to be about equal to 2013, automotive operating margin to be lower than 2013 and automotive operating-related cash flow to be substantially lower than 2013. This includes capital spending of about $7.5 billion to support new or significantly refreshed products and capacity actions. We now expect Ford Credit pre-tax profit to be about equal to or higher than 2013. And we continue to expect company pre-tax profit to be in the $7 billion to $8 billion range, as we continue to create innovative products such as the all new F-150. Overall, we expect 2014 to be a solid year for the Ford Motor Company in a critical next step forward and implementing our One Ford plan to continue delivering profitable growth for all. In closing, our One Ford plan is built on a compelling vision, comprehensive strategy and relentless implementation. Our One Ford plan continues to deliver profitable growth around the world and we are absolutely focused on building great products, creating a stronger business and contributing to a better world. We delivered solid results in the first quarter, despite several significant adverse factors that are not representative of the underlying run rate of our business and challenges in several important emerging markets. We remain on track in implementing our plan for full year 2014 including, continued strength from North America, although down from recent years, as we launched three times the numbers of products as in 2013; a loss in South America as we adjust to the changing environment and continued risk in Argentina and Venezuela; successful execution of our transformational plan for Europe, as we progress towards profitability in 2015, notwithstanding new challenges in Russia and Turkey; launch of our Middle East and Africa business unit; continue strong growth and profitability in Asia-Pacific; consistent solid performance from our Ford Credit operation; and positive automotive operating-related cash flow. Now, we will be pleased to take your questions. George Sharp : Thanks, Alan. Now, we'll open up the lines for about a 45 minute Q&A session. We'll begin with questions from the investment community and then take questions from the media. Now, in order to allow for as many participants as possible within this timeframe, please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two. Towanda, can we have the first question? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley : Two brief questions. First, on the Asia-Pacific margin 11.1%, pretty astonishing result. I think that's about at least 3x maybe the margin that the market expected. Can I give you a chance right now to kind of, say, hold your horses folks, please don't extrapolate this, consider the following headwinds that should keep us lower than that? That's my first question. Robert Shanks : So I'll say hold some of your horses. We have improved our guidance, so we do expect the reason to contribute more positively than we did three months ago, because the performance is strong, and it's being driven by China and the great response that consumers are giving our products and our brands. So it is going to do better. I would not multiply times-four, which I think is just the question, Adam. And that's largely around the fact that we still have the six plants under construction. Some of them will be coming on stream later this year. I think two other ones come on stream in 2015. So as we get closer to launch of those facilities, the cost will increase, we bring people onboard, we start to train them before we start producing and that type of thing. The other factor is we've got Lincoln launching later this year. Of course, we're already incurring expense related to that. But as we get closer to the launch in latter part of the year, there will be more expense associated with that. So I think those are the caveats I would put on, but clearly the region is doing fabulously, and we think it's going to have a great, great year. And finally, we've been talking about and that's been kind of eking through a bit more quarter-by-quarter, we're starting to see the pay off of the big investments in the region. Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley : Second quarter on the F-Series changeover. Another chance for you to take this opportunity to tell us anything in the remaining quarters of the year outlook, particularly in the second half you're like from the 13 weeks downtime and the cadence that you've already talked about that you might say, please guys, this is complicated, a big, big change for us. Can you add a little more -- any chance you'd add any more caution in that second half outlook in North America for us or not? Robert Shanks : Let me give a couple of comments first broadly and then Mark can comment further on F-Series. So one thing I would say, first at the company level, we had a solid start for the year and I'm sure we're going to get questions throughout the call on the Slide 7 and the factors that we showed as being sort of standouts, if you will, in terms of the size and factor all sort of occurring in the quarter. But we see the run rate of the business has been very healthy and very strong, both in case of total company, North America, I'd even say in South America, and you heard my comments about the balance of the year. Clearly, the first quarter is not indicative of what we expect in the balance of the year there. So the run rate of business is much healthier than what the initial view of the bottomline would see impacted. In fact, if anything, when you think about the emerging market issues, which are more intense than what we expected three months ago, we're observing that, and still think that business is going to deliver what we expected. And in fact, we're now trying to see elements of the business where we're changing the guidance upward. So I just want to give you that sense of how we're kind of seeing the overall business. In terms of calendarization of profits for the balance of the year, what I'll say is that we expect the rest of the year, the quarters to be substantially stronger than what we're seeing in the first quarter. And of course, things will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but they should all be better than what we're seeing in the first quarter. And so Mark, you want to comment on F-Series? Mark Fields : Overall, Adam, the preparations for the launch are going well and the team is very energized. We're going through, obviously the number of the production builds, but its going on plan. As we mentioned last quarter, we have three weeks of downtime of the '13 in the first quarter. And remember, we've mentioned that inclusive of that '13 was the summer shutdown week, so you can deduce what quarter that will be in. But clearly as we said, we got a manufacturing launch in the fourth quarter. So you can pretty much surmise where a lot of the downtime is going to be as we get the plan ready-to-go. But overall, when you stand back and look at our F-Series business, even with the existing model, our share is about the same as the full year for last year. We continue to run the plans, I think very efficiently. Our transaction prices are actually holding up very well, when you look at our transaction prices for '14 model a year, they're probably at the top of the segment of the under 8,500. So that business is going well. We're also looking at potential production opportunities for the existing F-Series in the remainder of this year. We have more work to do that could help us potentially get to the upper half of the margin range that we have for North America, but we have some work to do on that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson - Barclays: Just want to focus on the China results and kind of two related questions. One, kind of, can you give us the outlook for Asia Pacific x China and just directionally is that getting better, about the same or worse? And then secondly, within China how much of your success is from CUVs versus the car line up? How do you feel about your CUV position competitively? And as you kind of bring this plans on board, how they're going to be split between producing CUVs and cars? Robert Shanks : Brian, I'll handle the first one and then Mark will address the second one. So as I mentioned in the remarks earlier, the quarter's results were driven by China and I think that's both in terms of the year-over-year results and in an absolute. The rest of Asia Pacific is not as strong. It's not necessarily a drag on the business. But just sort of in a different place I think in terms of where we are in putting in place the big global production hubs that we're working on in India, and also in Thailand, so I think we'll see them start to contribute in a more positive way, a little bit after if you will the results that we're seeing now with China. Mark? Mark Fields : On the second question, when you look at our share performance in China, as Bob mentioned upfront, it was actually -- it was a record for the quarter at 4.5%, which was up 1 point versus a year ago. When you look at some of the elements driving that to your point, when you look at the segment, the SUV, CUV segment in China, as an industry, it was up about 28%. Our sales were up almost 300%. And the reason for that was, all the products that we introduced last year, the EcoSport, we have the EcoSport, Explorer, the Kuga, so we have a full line up there, and that's been a really important part of our growth in addition to the car side of the business, which we've done very well with. And then when you look at the texture of that, a lot of our growth has been in the Tier-3 through six cities and that's been supported by our network expansion. And when you think of maybe some of the infrastructure around, it lends itself well to SUVs and CUVs. And actually the type of demographics of the customer that we're getting is very encouraging, in addition to the profile of the segmentation. We're getting younger customers than the industry average. And interestingly, depending upon the model lines, 70% to 90% of customers they're buying our vehicles. It's either a first-time purchase or an addition to the car in the household. So I think that bodes well for us going forward. Brian Johnson - Barclays: So the CUV almost becomes the plus one car for the mass affluent in China? Alan Mulally : Well, we're also doing well and we continue to do well with our Focus. As we said our overall sales in the first quarter were up 45%, so we're doing well of Focus. Fusion is doing very well there and the Mondeo is actually doing very well, Mondeo is the Fusion, so both of them. It's a combination of both, but clearly our full family of SUVs and CUVs has really helped turbo charge that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan - UBS: One, any color on, why the recall cost was so large within the quarter? I mean is it the nature of the repair. Just any color on why such a large recall cost is my first question? Robert Shanks : This is a really important thing that we explain, so let me put in a little bit of a detail here. So first of all this is a warranty-reserve adjustment and I need to explain to how we at Ford account for field service actions. We use something that's called a pattern estimation model, so what that means is that every time that we sell a vehicle, we actually accrue a bit of reserve, if you will for field service actions that could happen in the future. So nothing specific in terms of a particular issue or problem, but based on history we expect that something could happen. So we reserve for that. And then what we do as we go forward in time, we then sort of top that reserve up or we might take it down, based on what we're seeing to changes in more recent history, if you will. I think we go back to about 2008s right now, so we don't go all the way back that, but kind of drop a year-over-year. And so it's just all based on history and what's actually happened. So what we've seen, we have seen more recalls at Ford and across the whole industry in the last couple of years or so. And so as that has occurred, what we've had to do is we've had to continue to look at the reserves and adjust them and that's what's happening in this quarter. It's based on a process that is disciplined, written in concrete. There is nothing behind this beyond just the update of the data and letting the date tell us that we need to increase reserves based on what's happened. Now, a couple of other things to let you know, is if we then have vehicles that are older, for example than 2008, and something happens, what we do is we actually have the impact to the flow right through to the bottomline, because we don't have any reserves in place. We can only hold them for as I said, maybe six, seven, eight years. If there is also an another little tweak on this, if there is an action that exceeds in the case of North America, $250 million of cost, we'll let that go right to the bottomline. So we wouldn't adjust our reserves if you will on a go-forward basis for that action, we just let it flow-through to bottomline. And actually we had in essence of that, 1 point last year. So this is simply a reserve adjustment as accounting, it's not cash, it's not related to any particular problem that we know of that we're concerned about. It's just an anticipation that something could happen based on what we've seen in terms of patterns of data over the model years that we're talking about. So based on that and letting our process work, we've increased the reserves in the quarter by about $400 million in total and most of that is related to what I've talked about in terms just of just topping up the reserve. So hopefully everybody understands that and recognizes this and it is what it is, but it's not a problem per se. Colin Langan - UBS: And how often is that calculation done? Is it a quarterly analysis that you do or is that an annual? Robert Shanks : This particular adjustment is we conducted, what are called sort of deep dives twice a year in the first quarter and the third quarter. So that's why it's happening in this quarter. And if I go back, because I did go back to and I expected that you guys might ask about what happened in the past and looking at 2013, and we actually didn't have much that was taking place for '13. We have one quarter where we have some reserve adjustment going up coincidently in that quarter. We also had a supplier recovery on a particular action, which sort of offset that. So that's why we didn't call, either the recovery or the reserve adjustment up, because they were sort of offsetting each other. Colin Langan - UBS: One last question. I believe in your comments you said that North America margins should be in the 8% to 9% range. You're starting up with 7.3% and there is a lot of launch cost in the second half of the year. Is that a still the valid range to think about for the full year or did I mishear that? Robert Shanks : No, absolutely, because when you think about the first quarter, we were at 7.3% including in all the things that we've just been talking, the weather issues, the reserve adjustments. So if you think about the run rate of the business in the quarter, we were nearly at 10% in North America. As the year progresses we have a lot of new products that will be coming in addition to the For-Series. Some of that will give us some favorable product mix. This quarter we had favorable, unfavorable series mix and options, but that will start to be offset by favorable product mix as the year progresses. The other thing I think that is different than where we were three months ago, we guided to the fact that we thought North America would have negative pricing for the year. And certainly we see that in the quarter, but as we look ahead, I think we're starting to see the possibility of that being maybe more flat, maybe potentially somewhat positive, because the overall environment has been a bit more positive, more disciplined across the industry in general than what we maybe thought would be the case three months ago. Mark, anything to add? Mark Fields : No, as just mentioned earlier as we look at that 8% to 9%, we're looking at additional production opportunities on the current F-Series, which all things being equal, could actually pushes up in the upper range of that, but we have some work to do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan: There have been a couple already on China and Asia Pacific, but I'd like to approach it from a little bit different of an angle. Obviously, the results there are quite strong despite the impact of some pretty aggressive, growth-related investments. So I am curious what comments that you could make regarding the potential earnings power of this region a few years out, after which presumably, we could see some tapering of the growth investments? Robert Shanks : Well, we've said I think, Ryan, for quite a long time that we thought towards the mid-decade or so that the region would contribute very meaningfully significantly to the bottomline of the company. And I think that's still our point of view. We expect this to be one of the larger regions of the business going forward. It is largest region of the world in terms of industry and we're making great progress and taking and participating in that. We also have capacity increases that are still ahead of us. We have more expansion of our product portfolio ahead of this. As I mentioned earlier, we see India and Southeast Asia, maybe lagging a bit behind where we are in China in terms of the maturity of our investments there. So I think that's an opportunity down the road. So I think we feel like this will be a region that will definitely be a meaningful significant contributor to Ford's bottomline. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan: And then for my second and final question. I guess, maybe just one on South America. You continue to take really a lot of price down there and at the same time some of the vehicle production forecasters, IHS, et cetera, they've recently slashed their expectations for sales and production in the back half of the year a lot, including for you guys. So I wonder if you think that it might be a concern as we transition to a potentially, I guess softer demand environment that it might become more difficult to continue to offset with price, the inflationary currency pressures as well as you have been in recent years. Robert Shanks : Yes, I think it's different by market. We're actually, at least up till now, we've been able to more or less -- maybe it depends on timing of a quarter, because we've seen such significant deprecation that some times you can't fully recapture that all in a quarter. But I think in the case of Venezuela and in the case of Argentina, we've seen better ability to over a relatively reasonable period of time as to offset the effect of operating exchange weakness and/or low inflation. I think it's different in Brazil. It's a much more competitive environment. All that capacity, as you mentioned that's coming in, it's making that I think a tougher place in order to capture, to offset, if you will the effects that I talked about. I think the thing that is a positive for us though is the complete transformation of the portfolio. All the new products that are coming in, some are still ahead of us, because we're seeing an extremely favorable response from consumers, both in terms of what it's done for us in share, but also our ability to get a really healthy transaction price for those products. But nonetheless, Brazil is, as we've been talking about that for some time have been a concern around the competitive environment and all the capacity coming in. Mark Fields : The only other thing I'd add to Bob's point about the product lineup and working on the revenue side, as you can imagine, following our process of looking at the business environment, the team there is very focused on looking at optimizing our footprint that we have down there. We are working on our logistical cost, which is very important, material cost reductions, seeing where we can accelerate localization actions and just overall structural cost improvement. So we are working both sides of the profit equation for that part of the world. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : I was hoping, just not to harp on this too much, but is the field service charge is a pretty big number. Can you just elaborate on how much of it is related to adjusting the pattern estimation model? How much of it is discrete and how much is older vehicles? You did mention that there were some '01 to '05 vehicles in there, which obviously is going to raise some questions, in light of what some others are dealing with. So what is the issue there? And maybe if you could just say specifically, what is the issue with the '01 to '05 models? Robert Shanks : Yes, and they are all public. We have about $400 million associated with the field service actions, of that about $350 million relates to the '09 through '13 model years -- is it '08, '09? '08 through '13 model years. We then have two issues that were for the older model years. We have a Crown Vic Rim -- I think it's a Crown Vic Grand Marquis lighting control module that was a recall that was for the '03, '05 model years that was about $30 million to $40 million. And then we had and Escape subframe issue that was roughly $30 million and that was '01 through '04. And there was maybe about $10 million of just general offsets to all of that. Most of it is the reserve adjustments. The other two were relatively small. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : So there is not like a review of historical vehicles or something like that that's unusual? Robert Shanks : No, those are simply -- we're always looking at data to understand where we have issues. Those were things that clearly popped up and indicated that we had an issue for our normal process, addressing ASAP. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : And just two more things. Just on your material costs have been in North America really big offset to the price and mix recently through the past three quarters in a row. Obviously, it's depended on timing of new launches. Could you just give us some thoughts on how we should be thinking about price mix versus materials looking forward? And then on China, you mentioned again that you have a lot of plans to expand that are in launching. And you previously said that higher launch costs are going to be a factor this year, but this quarter it seems like your cost structure was actually improved. So can you quantify the magnitude of the launch costs that you'd anticipate for this year? Robert Shanks : In the case of North America for the full year, we still would expect to see I think positive material cost overall. We're seeing very good material cost reductions. We will have as the new products are introduced increases related to them. But because they're launching more second half, if you will, at least lot of the volume on a year-over-year basis, the affect will be probably more in '15 than in this year. In the case of Asia Pacific, what we're seeing there is, as you said the quarter doesn't indicate what we expect to see for the full year. But for the full year, we'll see more cost come in and that will largely be around spending-related manufacturing, more in terms of engineering and also advertising sales promotions as we launch and support the products. And then a general, admin and expense selling will go up. Some of that related to Lincoln and some of it just related to the overall growth of the business that we need to put resources in place to support it. So it's really across, I guess I'm saying all parts of the business, but it's going to be sort of a growth quarter-by-quarter as the business expands. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Pat Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Actually just sort of building on that last question on Europe, the losses were pared back more than I think a number of us had thought. Can you just give us a sense of sequentially how some of the cost cadence plays out because I guess you still have the big Mondeo launch right at Valencia, which I imagine is going to be sort of a headwind? And any other factors obviously, we're not thinking about as we sort of try and model that out? Robert Shanks : I guess, I'd say, first of all, you know that there is a sort of a pattern to profits in general in Europe, usually the first half is better than the second half, third quarter, I don't that was the case last year, but third quarter is usually a weaker quarter, because of the extensive plant shutdowns that take place for holidays and so forth. Of course, all of that as you said, Pat, is dependent upon particular cadence of product launches that we have over the course of the year. But again, there, we've had some more launches and we're launching actually some things right now in Europe. So I don't know that I'd call out any particular thing in terms of the cadence of our structural cost going forward. I think probably the fluctuations up and down will be more around volume levels, and I don't think I would call anything else out. Pat Archambault - Goldman Sachs : And one other one on South America. You might have said it, but can you kind of parse out what was sort of balance sheet remeasurement in Venezuela versus what was just kind of operating headwinds just from the lack of volume? And maybe can you give us a sense of just what you are seeing on the ground there? I mean it sounds like production is at a standstill. I understand visibility is poor, but what are the prospects for that to improve in coming quarters? Robert Shanks : You're talking about Venezuela specifically? Pat Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Yes. Robert Shanks : So maybe Mark can comment. And I'll just in terms of the balance sheet effects of the amount that we talked about on Slide 7, $310 million of that is Venezuela specifically, about $70 million is related Argentina. And then on a year-over-year basis, you can see on Slide 14, the year-over-year basis, the balance sheet effect was roughly half of what we're seeing in total. And of that, a good portion of that -- well, actually most of the overall effect is actually Argentina and Venezuela, and a bit of Brazil. Mark Fields : From a volume standpoint and industry standpoint in Venezuela, as we said last quarter, what we did in the fourth quarter of last year was literally cut our production by three quarters versus the running rate, in the first three quarters of 2013. And what we mentioned is that's our assumption going forward, the remainder of 2014. And when you look at the industry development to put it in perspective, the first quarter of last year, the Venezuela industry was about 113,000 units on a SAAR basis. This year it's 12,000 units. So I think we've baked those assumptions into our plan and we'll continue to watch the environment there and also continue to support Venezuelan customers at the same time minimize their exposures. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citi: Just going back to the warranty item in the quarter, Bob, just why wouldn't that also potentially impact other regions if you are assessing sort of the overall experience just given the company's global platforms and commonality? Robert Shanks : Well, because in part some of the products may not be in some of the regions. I mean we do the same reserve analysis everywhere. You also have different suppliers, in some cases the products are tailored to different design, different powertrains. So they are global, but there are differences region-by-region. We also as we launched, we don't launch everything all of one time, so as we launch in one region, then the next, then the next, then the next, we kind of learned from the first region, and we kind of build those learnings into a launch at the next region including design changes and so forth. So it's not all apples-and-apples, if you will. Itay Michaeli - Citi: Then just second question, hoping to gauge your temperature on the mid-decade 8% to 9% margin outlook. I know in December you labeled it at risk citing Europe. It seems like Europe is probably going better, Asia is certainly going better, but South America going worse. So maybe just give us an update of what you are thinking. Is that more at risk, less at risk or roughly the same today than it was in December Mark Fields : I don't think at the moment I'd say anything different. Operator : Ladies and gentleman, we will now take questions from the media. Your next question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin with Associated Press. Dee-Ann Durbin - Associated Press : Alan, it's time for my quarterly question about your future. There is some speculation out there, obviously that the leadership change is going to happen earlier than the end of this year. Can you comment on whether the plans have changed? Alan Mulally : Well, clearly, we don't comment on speculation and we have no change to the plan. And I just want to point out is, is I think you well know is that Bill and I have put a great high priority seven years ago, that we would further develop our team worldwide and have a very robust leadership development and succession plan. And we're very, very pleased with the progress on that to date. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David Whiston - Morningstar: A question on the credit line extension. Is that primarily being done to increase the capital liquidity or are you also expecting some higher CapEx than planned or even returning more cash to shareholders down the road? Robert Shanks : No, it's just basically is, as we get bigger and as we continue to expand and grow, we thought it was prudent for us to take advantage of actually very strong from our global banking group and also very healthy capital markets for us to increase and extend the credit facility. The other thing that's kind of great about it is we're actually returning out sort of a normal credit facility, five year terms that I think it's first time we have been there for quite a number of years with this change. So we feel very positive about that too. So that's what behind it. David Whiston - Morningstar: And the incentive spending in North America, I know you have got some pretty tough comps in the U.S. given how well you guys have been doing there, but this quarter unfavorable headwinds from volume and mix combined with the incentive spending. Are you guys more just playing defense now for now until the next generation F-Series is out? Mark Fields : Well, I think overall when you look at our incentive spend, we look at our incentive spend in conjunction with our overall margins and transaction prices. And when you look at our transaction prices, they're at the top end of the industry and it kind of reinforces the margin that we have in North America. Clearly, in a number of our products, they're kind of late in their lifecycle, so we're accounting for that and also at the same time as those new products come on that will offer us opportunities once those products are launched. So that's kind of the way we're looking at balanced and making sure we profitability grow and take care to that. Robert Shanks : And David, I would just add that in the quarter comparison, which just what you've seen in the data today, a bit of that is if you will a difficult comp because last year we had just launched the Kuga and we had just launched the Fusion. And they were in very, very high demand. We had very tight supplies. And so incentive levels for those products were very, very low and those are high volume products for us. Now, more normal if you will. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Flock with Fox Business Networks. Jeff Flock - Fox Business Networks : Mr. Mulally just to confirm and to clarify what you said earlier, I'm sorry that I have ask about this, but there you go. Earlier, I believe you said you were going to skip to the plan in terms of succession, and I think if I recall correctly, you said that you plan to serve through the end of 2014. Does that then indicate that the plan, that that you will serve through the end of 2014, can you clarify that? Alan Mulally : Jeff, no change to the plan. Jeff Flock - Fox Business Networks : Well, I appreciate that clarification. And the rumors that you're going to coach the Detroit Lions, is that still a non-starter? Mark Fields : Yes. That's very interesting, but Bill has a great plan for the Lions. Jeff Flock - Fox Business Networks : So just to confirm, no change to the plan that was announced earlier in the plan, which was, you plan to serve through the end of 2014? Mark Fields : No change to the plans, yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Karl Henkel with Detroit News. Karl Henkel - Detroit News : One quick question back to the warranty reserve, is there any way that you kind of put that in context, how big is that reserve? And I guess being up $400 million versus Q1 of 2013 in that department, I guess what is it a typical year-over-year increase when you look at the reserve directionally heading upward? Robert Shanks : Two responses there, one at the end of last year, our total warranty reserve, which would include for field service actions was $3.9 million for the company. And in terms of the second question, I mean this is an unusually large increase. And as I mentioned earlier, if I go back and look at the four quarters of last year, we did not have something of this magnitude occur. So this is unusual. That's exactly why we're calling it out, so that everybody understands the run rate of the business, because you wouldn't expect something like this to happen quarter-in and quarter-out. Karl Henkel - Detroit News : I guess is there any significant impact, as a follow-up, on just the global sales growth for Ford over the last few years and looking into the future having a significant impact on that number increasing further or am I kind of looking into that too much? Robert Shanks : You mean related to the warranty reserve increase? Karl Henkel - Detroit News : Yes. Robert Shanks : I don't think so. Because, again, I think what you're seeing across the whole industry is all OEMs are responding very, very quickly in general to the issues that they see. Vehicles have a lot more technology and that they're far more complex. So I just think that this just seem to be more of a general industry phenomenon. And unfortunately, because we don't like product recalls on field service actions, unfortunately that's been our history as well over the last couple of years. But it's really an industry phenomenon. Alan Mulally : And also, Karl, if you look from our perspective, we're really pleased with the value level we're seeing, really all-time record highs in some parts of the world. And even here in the U.S. we're starting to see some encouraging quality data, which hopefully will then lead through to a better performance, based on the reserves we set up. But as we said, we're very committed to delivering best-in-class quality to our customers and everybody is focused on that encouraging signs. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey with Wall Street Journal. Mike Ramsey - Wall Street Journal : So if I say that the warranty reserve is reflective of a larger number of recalls over the last several years, not just for Ford, but also for the industry. Is that an accurate statement? Robert Shanks : The warranty reserves are going up because of our experience. What I am trying to say is that our experience though is not necessarily unique, if you will, to the automotive industry, you are seeing more and more companies, higher number of recalls, higher number of units being affected, and that's an industry phenomenon. But what drives our warranty reserves is our experience. Mike Ramsey - Wall Street Journal : And just as a follow-up, I think it was 2007, wasn't there inverse of this that was beneficial? There was a big readjustment of warranty reserves some time I think it was 2007, am I crazy or does anyone remember those? Robert Shanks : It could have been because one of the things that as I mentioned, we only hold these reserves for about six or seven years. So when that oldest year, if you will, is ready to run off as we move into the next calendar year. If there is anything left in that reserve that hasn't been used, we release it. So it's possible that could have happened back in 2007, somewhere in that timeframe. I actually kind of remember something like that as well, Mike, but I know we've had situations like that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alisa Priddle with Detroit Free Press. Alisa Priddle - Detroit Free Press : Just first question for Mark, if you could just clarify, when you say you want to get more production of current F-150, so are you talking about running more over time in plants or changeover schedule or what kinds of things that you're looking at? Mark Fields : We're working very closely with our supply base. In terms of seeing if they can support some additional production opportunities and that may mean running more over time at some of our -- whether it is Dearborn Truck as we run out the existing model and get ready for the new one or in Kansas City where, as you know, we're not launching that plant till next year. So, yes, it's so far encouraging, more work to do, but it involves the whole team. And the good news, Alisa, is it's really based on market demand. And as we said, if you look at the month of March and another month where we sold over a 70,000 F-Series, so the demand is out there, customers really like the product, the existing product. And we're going to trying to get as many as we can to them. Alisa Priddle - Detroit Free Press : So you're not talking about changing any of the dates of changeover? Mark Fields : No. Alisa Priddle - Detroit Free Press : Those are locked in. Mark Fields : Those are locked in, making more out of the time, we do have. Alisa Priddle - Detroit Free Press : And then, Alan, so it sounds like you'll still be with us on the next earnings call. Alan Mulally : No, change with that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America John Murphy - Bank of America : Two quick questions for you. First, when you guys were on Slide 12 and talking about the drivers of a slight market share deterioration, you mentioned daily rent and small cars declining. It seems like that is kind of a trend that has been happening, but also something you might be doing more actively as your larger vehicles are getting more fuel-efficient and particularly as we think forward to the launch of the F-150 where you guys have alluded to the fact that it will be net accretive to your CAFE measurements and standalone on its own. Are we sort of seeing the precursor in the potential for you to deemphasize the not so profitable small car business as we go forward? Mark Fields : Absolutely, not. We're focused on delivering what customers want and it's not really driven -- those are kind of not the way we're thinking about it. We're thinking very much from a customer and a market-end standpoint. As you know, we're doing well with our car lineup. We're doing well with our truck lineup. And we're going to go wherever the customer demands with that full family of vehicles. John Murphy - Bank of America : But if they demand larger more fuel-efficient vehicles and not so many small cars, you will go that direction. You will go where the market goes? Mark Fields : Well, we're always going to match capacity to demand, and in the context of running a good business and a profitably growing business. John Murphy - Bank of America : And then a second question. You guys mentioned $2 billion of the new credit facility would be allocated to Ford Motor Credit. Just curious what that is relative to history and are we seeing more capital being allocated to Ford Motor Credit, so you can grow that business significantly sort of similar to where it was historically? Robert Shanks : No, we haven't done that before and we're doing that so that we can allow them to diversify their overall funding structure. So it's just a better balance sheet for Ford Credit to support their, own overall funding structure. John Murphy - Bank of America : So it's less of a reliance on the securitization market and more of a reliance on your sort of on-balance sheet financing now? Robert Shanks : No, it's also to support, we had something called FCAR in the past, which we're actually moving away from it. And we're going to replace that with more unsecured debt and this is just part of supporting that. Operator : Ladies and gentleman, that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. George Sharp for closing remarks. George Sharp : Well, thank you everyone. That wraps up today's presentation. We're really glad that you were able to join us. Operator : Thank you for joining today's conference. That concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. And have a great day.",

My name is Kanti and I'm your operator for today.  At this time all participants are on listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. George Sharp, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed sir. George Sharp : Thank you Kanti and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to welcome you and thank you for joining us today either by phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning, so we can provide you with additional details of our second quarter 2014 financial results.  Now, presenting today are Mark Fields, who became President and CEO of Ford earlier this month, and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO.  Now, copies of this morning's press release and presentation slides are available on Ford's Investor and Media websites. The financial results discussed today are preliminary and include references to non-GAAP financial measures.  Now any non-GAAP financial measure are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck, and final data will be included in our Form 10-Q. Now finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance. Of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation and detailed in our SEC filings.  With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the presentation over to Mark. Mark Fields : Thanks George. I\u2019m really pleased to join you this morning and today we\u2019ll review our second quarter financial results, the details behind them and our outlook ahead. So let's get right into the first slide. Our strong results this quarter are due once again to the success of our ONE Ford plan, which remains unchanged. We are continuing to focus on all four elements of the plan. They have served us very well and will continue to be our focus going forward.  We also plan to build on our success by accelerating the pace of progress throughout our business. In many ways we are just starting to see the full benefits and strength of ONE Ford and we intend to maximize these opportunities going forward. At the same time, we are passionate about product excellence and leading in innovation. We are committed to building on the product strength today, with even more new products and innovations that will deliver growth for our stakeholders and define our company going forward.  Now let's turn to slide two for a look at the second quarter. Overall, we delivered a strong quarter. We achieved our 20th consecutive profitable quarter and our best quarterly pretax profit since the second quarter of 2011. We also delivered positive automotive operating related cash flow and ended the quarter once again with strong liquidity. Although second quarter wholesale volume and revenue declined 1% year-over-year, we achieved higher market share in Asia Pacific, driven by record share in China.  All automotive business units contributed to the company's pretax profit, and all improved from a year ago, with the exception of South America. North America achieved record quarterly performance for pretax profit; Asia Pacific achieved a second quarter record; and Europe earned its first quarterly profit since the market dramatically declined three years ago. Ford Credit once again delivered solid results. As we\u2019ve said, this year is the most aggressive in our history for new product launches. We remain on track with our 23 global product launches. Our full-year outlook for the company pretax profit is unchanged, ranging from $7 billion to $8 billion. Our outlook for automotive revenue and operating margin also remains unchanged.  Today, we are improving our outlook for automotive operating related cash flow to lower than a year ago, from substantially lower, due to the strong cash flow generated in the first half. As we look forward, we expect the payoff of our investments this year will be a strong product line up, with higher volumes, revenues and margins in 2015 and beyond.  Let's turn to slide three to recap some of the quarter's other achievements. Both our Ford and Lincoln brands made strong improvements in the latest J.D. Power 2014 U.S. Initial Quality Study, with the F-150, Edge and Lincoln MKX ranking highest in their segments. To support growth, we revealed several new products, including the all-new 2015 Edge, Focus ST and Escort in China. We also revealed a number of concepts, including the Ford Everest in China, the S-MAX Vignale in Europe, and the Ford Lightweight Concept, which showcases our commitment to light-weighting and advanced material innovation.  In China we launched our Lincoln brand, including the reveal of the MKX concept. We also began North American production of Transit from our Kansas City plant, and the Lincoln MKC from Louisville. In Europe we increased production of Fiesta in Cologne to meet growing European demand. Ford Otosan, our joint venture in Turkey, began vehicle production from a new plant in Turkey. In China, we opened a new transmission plant with our joint venture partner, Changan Ford Automobile, and in Brazil, we launched a new engine plant. We reached agreement with the German Works Council to improve flexibility and efficiency at our Cologne plant, with the production of the next-generation Fiesta.  Currently, we are implementing a previously announced share repurchase program for up to 116 million shares to offset an up to 3% dilutive effect of potential convertible debt conversions and stock-based compensation.  Now, Bob Shanks will take us through the details of our second quarter results. Bob, you want to take it away? Bob Shanks : Yes, thanks Mark and good morning everyone. Starting at the top on slide four, second quarter wholesale volume was 1.7 million units, down 17,000 units from a year ago; and revenue was $37.4 billion, down $500 million. Pretax profit was $2.6 billion, excluding special items, $44 million higher than a year ago.  After-tax earnings per share at $0.40 were $0.05 lower. Net income attributable to Ford, including pretax special item charges was $1.3 billion, $78 million higher than a year ago. Earnings were $0.32 a share, up $0.02.  Pretax special item charges were $481 million in the quarter. These include the impairment of our equity investment in the Ford Sollers joint venture in Russia, reflecting the present outlook for the business, including a weaker ruble, lower industry volume, and adverse industry segmentation changes that negatively impact sales of Focus. Also included in special item charges are separation related actions, primarily in Europe, to support our transformation plan. You can find details on these charges in appendix three. Automotive operating-related cash flow was $2.6 billion, our 17th consecutive quarter of positive performance, and automotive gross cash was $25.8 billion, exceeding debt by $10.4 billion. Consistent with our most recent guidance, our second quarter operating effective tax rate, which isn't shown was 44%, reflecting calendarization effects, including the impact of regional profits.  We continue to expect our full-year operating effective tax rate to be about 35%, assuming retroactive extension of U.S. Research Credit Legislation in the fourth quarter. Our third quarter rate is expected to be about equal to our second quarter rate. In the first half, vehicle wholesales increased by 2% from a year ago, while company revenue was about flat. First-half pretax operating profit excluding special items was $4 billion, a decline of $721 million and net income was $2.3 billion, $544 million lower than a year ago.  As shown on slide five, both our Automotive and Financial Services sectors contributed to the company's second quarter pretax profit. As shown in the memo, the year-over-year improvement in company second quarter pretax profit is more than explained by the automotive sector. As mentioned, all regions improved except South America. Compared with first quarter, company pretax profit was $1.2 billion higher, more than explained by automotive. The improvement over first quarter largely reflects non-recurrence of several significant adverse factors that we highlighted last quarter.  The key market factors and financial metrics for our automotive business in the second quarter are shown on slide six. As you can see on the far left and as already mentioned, wholesale volume decreased by 1% compared with a year ago, and automotive revenue decreased by 2%. The lower volume is more than explained by lower market share in all regions, except Asia Pacific. Global industry SAAR is estimated at 87.3 million units, up 3% from a year ago. Ford global market share is estimated at 7.5%, down two-tenths of a percentage point. Operating margin was 6.6%, up two-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago and automotive pretax profit was $2.2 billion, up $66 million.  As shown in the memo below the chart, first half volume was up 2% from a year ago, while automotive revenue was down 1%. Operating margin at 5% was down eight-tenths of a percentage point and total automotive pretax profit at $3.1 billion was down $658 million. Slide seven shows the factors that contributed to the $66 million improvement in second quarter automotive pretax profit. As you can see, lower cost and favorable market factors more than explain the improvement. Adverse exchange driven by South America was a partial offset. As shown in the memo, pretax profit was $1.3 billion higher than first quarter, more than explained by favorable volume and mix and non-repeat of the significant adverse factors referenced earlier.  Slide eight shows second quarter pretax results for each of our automotive operations, as well as Other Automotive. North America and Asia Pacific were strongly profitable, with the former reporting a record quarterly profit and the latter a second quarter record.  Middle East and Africa and Europe also were profitable, while South America reported at a loss. Other Automotive primarily reflects net interest expense. For the full year, we continue to expect net interest expense to be about $700 million.  Now we\u2019ll look at each of the regions within the automotive sector, starting on slide nine with North America. North America's second quarter pretax profit continued to be driven by robust industry sales, our strong product line-up, continued discipline in matching production to demand and a lean cost structure, even as we continue to invest for future growth.  North America's second quarter wholesale volume and revenue declined 5% and 3%, respectively from a year ago. The volume decrease is explained by lower market share and an unfavorable change in dealer stocks, offset partially by higher industry sales.  The U.S. industry SAAR of 16.9 million units in the second quarter was 1.2 million units higher than a year ago. Our U.S. market share deteriorated 1.2 percentage points to 15.3%, reflecting primarily a planned reduction in daily rental sales, lower F-Series share as we continue to balance share, transaction prices and stocks as we prepare for the new F-150; and lower Edge and Focus share.  As shown in appendix seven, U.S. retail market share of the retail industry was 12.9% in the second quarter, down eight-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago, explained primarily by lower F-Series, Edge and Focus.  The decline in revenue is more than explained by the lower wholesale volume and a weaker Canadian dollar, offset partially by favorable mix. North America operating margin was 11.6%, up one percentage point from a year ago and pretax profit was a record $2.4 billion, up $119 million.  As shown in the memo below the chart, all first-half metrics declined from the year ago. The adverse first quarter impact of $500 million associated with changes in warranty reserves and weather related premium costs explains the majority of the lower profit and operating margin.  On slide 10, we show the factors that contributed to North America's second quarter increase in pretax profit. The improvement is more than explained by lower cost and higher parts and accessory profit. As shown in the memo, pretax profit was higher than first quarter, more than explained by favorable market factors and non-recurrence of the significant adverse factors experienced in the first quarter.  Turning to our full-year guidance for North America, we continue to expect pretax profit to be lower than 2013 and operating margin to range from 8% to 9%. Our guidance includes 13 weeks of production downtime this year for the launch of the new F-150, including the summer shutdown at our Dearborn and Kansas City plants. Three weeks occurred in the first quarter, and at the Dearborn plant, eight consecutive weeks are planned beginning in late August. The Kansas City summer shutdown in July and a few individual down days in the second half make up the remainder of the downtime. Now let's turn to slide 11 and review South America, where we\u2019re continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product line-up and progressively replacing legacy products with global ONE Ford offerings. We are also continuing to manage the effects of slowing GDP growth and lower industry volume in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation, as well as policy uncertainty in some countries.  In the second quarter wholesale volume and revenue decreased from a year ago by 22% and 30% respectively. The lower volume is primarily explained by an 800,000 unit decline from last year's SAAR of 6.1 million units. This includes the impact of the weakening economy in Brazil, import restrictions in Argentina, and lower production in Venezuela, resulting from limited availability of U.S. dollars.  South America market share at 8.8% was down three-tenths of a percent, more than explained by the model changeover of Ka and the phase-out of Fiesta Classic. The revenue decline is explained primarily by the lower volume and unfavorable exchange, offset partially by higher net pricing.  Operating margin was negative 14%, down significantly from a year ago and pretax loss was $295 million, a deterioration of $446 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first half metrics deteriorated from a year ago. On slide 12 we show the factors contributing to the decline in South America's second quarter pretax results. All factors were unfavorable, with the exception of pricing, which did not fully offset the adverse effects of weaker currencies and high local inflation. As shown in the memo, pretax results improved compared with first quarter, more than explained by favorable exchange, mainly non-repeat of adverse balance sheet exchange effects in Venezuela and Argentina.  For the full year we now expect South America to incur a larger loss than we previously guided. Although we continue to expect higher market share and positive net pricing in the second half, as we launch the all-new Ka Small Car, we now expect the rest of the year to be about breakeven to a loss due to lower than expected industry volumes and weaker currencies. The volatility in the region, including potential currency devaluations, adds uncertainty to our short-term projections.  Let's turn now to Europe, beginning on slide 13, where we continue to implement our transformation plan, focused on product, brand and cost, and remain on track to achieve profitability in 2015.  Europe's wholesale volume was about unchanged from a year ago, while revenue improved 10%. Europe 20 SAAR was 14.4 million units, up 700,000 units from a year ago. This was offset partially by industry declines in Russia and Turkey. Europe 20\u2019s market share at 7.9% was down two-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago, reflecting primarily a reduction in rental and fleet share, as well as adverse industry segmentation in passenger car. Although not shown, our commercial vehicle share improved in the second quarter to 10.6%, up 0.5 percentage point from a year ago to our highest second quarter share since 1997. This was driven by our refreshed and expanded range of Transit products.  As shown in appendix seven, passenger car share of the retail segment of the five major European markets was 8.3% in the second quarter, down one-tenth of a percentage point from the same period last year, more than explained by adverse industry segmentation.  The increase in revenue mainly reflects higher volume in the Europe 20 markets and favorable exchange, offset partially by unfavorable mix. Europe's operating margin was two-tenths of a percent, an improvement of 4.4 percentage points from a year ago and pretax profit was $14 million, a $320 million improvement. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first half metrics improved from a year ago.  Slide 14 shows the factors that contributed to the improvement in Europe's second quarter pretax results. The improvement is more than explained by lower cost and favorable exchange. Partial offsets include lower results and royalties from our joint ventures, primarily in Russia, along with lower parts and accessories profit. Restructuring costs were lower than a year ago, primarily due to a reserve release this quarter associated with our Cologne investment agreement and non-recurrence of a facility write-off in Genk last year. As shown in the memo below the chart, pretax results improved compared with first quarter, more than explained by lower cost and favorable market factors.  We are very encouraged by Europe's first quarterly profit since 2011. This supports our unchanged full-year guidance for the region, which is for results to improve compared with 2013.  Consistent with the normal seasonality of sales and production, we expect our second-half loss to be higher than the first half loss of $180 million. Projected lower second half wholesale volumes of about 100,000 units include the effect of summer shutdowns in the third quarter and year-end shutdowns in the fourth quarter. In addition, we expect higher restructuring related cost in the second half, including non-repeat of this quarter's reserve release, and higher launch related costs with started production of the all-new Mondeo and the new Focus. A final comment on Russia. The current environment clearly is difficult, but Russia remains a large and important market. We are working with our partner in Ford Sollers to develop actions to improve our business outlook going forward. Let's turn now to slide 15 and talk about Middle East and Africa, our newest business unit, which was created to better serve customers and expand in this fast-growing region. We are intensifying our focus and targeting opportunities for growth in small, midsize and large vehicle segments.  In the second quarter, we wholesaled 49,000 vehicles in the region, 3,000 fewer than a year ago. Revenue was $1.1 billion, $100 million lower. The lower volume primarily reflects lower market share, driven by increased competitive pressures on Expedition in the Middle East. The lower revenue is explained by the lower volume and unfavorable exchange.  Operating margin was 2%, up nine-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago and pretax profit was $23 million, up $10 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, first half volume and revenue deteriorated from a year ago, but operating margin and pretax profit improved.  Our full-year guidance for Middle East and Africa remains unchanged. We expect results to be about breakeven, with quarterly variability driven by factors such as the timing of production, the mix of vehicles, and long shipping time. Let's now review Asia Pacific on slide 16. Our strategy in Asia Pacific continues to be to grow aggressively with an expanding portfolio of ONE Ford products, with many factoring hubs in China, India and ASEAN. As shown on the left, second quarter wholesale volume was up 21% compared with a year ago, and net revenue which excludes our China joint ventures grew 9%.  Our China wholesale volume, not shown, was up 26% in the quarter. Higher volume in the region primarily reflects higher market share and industry volume. We estimate second quarter SAAR for the region at 39.6 million units, up 2.2 million units from a year ago, fully explained by China.  Our second quarter market share was a record 3.7%, four-tenths of a percentage point higher than a year ago. This was driven by China, where our market share improved three-tenths of a percentage point to a record 4.6%, reflecting continued strong sales of Mondeo, Fiesta and Kuga.  Asia Pacific's higher revenue is explained primarily by the higher volume and favorable mix. Operating margin was 5.5%, up six-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago and pretax profit was $159 million, up $29 million and a second quarter record. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first half metrics improved substantially from a year ago.  Slide 17 shows that the improvement in Asia Pacific's second quarter pretax profit is more than explained by favorable volume and mix. As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific's pretax results declined from first quarter, more than explained by higher costs. These cost increases include a higher warranty cost and continued investment in growth, including costs associated with fixed plants, one that opened in China during the quarter, and five plants still under construction in China and India.  For the full year we continue to expect Asia Pacific to earn a higher pretax profit than a year ago. We expect full-year results will be strong for the region, with third and fourth quarter results down from the second quarter.  Volume improvements will be more than offset by higher cost as we continue to invest for future growth, including the five plants still under construction in China and India, and the launch of Lincoln in China this fall.  Let's turn now on slide 18 to Ford Credit, which is an integral part of our global growth and value creation strategy. Ford Credit provides world class dealer and customer financial services, supported by a strong balance sheet, providing solid profits and distribution to Ford.  Ford Credit's lower pretax profit this quarter compared to a year ago is more than explained by a higher level of insurance losses from storm damage to dealer inventory in the quarter, which is included in other. As shown in the memo, pretax profit was lower compared with first quarter, again, more than explained by the insurance losses just mentioned. For the full year, we now expect Ford Credit pretax profit to be higher than 2013, improved from about equal to or higher.  We also now expect year end managed receivables of $112 billion to $115 billion, up from our prior guidance of about $110 billion. Our guidance for Ford Credit managed leverage and distributions to its parent is unchanged.  Next on slide 19 is our automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $25.8 billion, an increase of $600 million from the end of the first quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was $2.6 billion. Automotive profit and favorable timing and other differences were offset partially by higher net spending and unfavorable changes in working capital.  During the quarter we contributed about $300 million to our global funded pension plans, down substantially from the last two years, due to recent improvements in the funded status of our plant. Dividends paid in the quarter totaled about $500 million and other items includes about $850 million related to the stock buyback program now underway. Slide 20 shows that automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.5 billion, $300 million lower than first quarter. We ended the quarter with net cash of $10.4 billion and automotive liquidity of $36.7 billion. We completed in the quarter our corporate credit facility amendment and maturity extensions. The facility is now $12.2 billion, of which $2 billion has been allocated to Ford Credit.  This concludes our review of the financial details of our second quarter earnings. So now I\u2019d like to turn it back to Mark, who will take us through our outlook for the business environment, as well as our 2014 planning assumptions and key metrics. Mark. Mark Fields : Thanks a lot Bob. Slide 21 summarizes our view of the business environment for 2014. We project global economic growth to be in the 2.5% to 3% range, and global industry sales to be about 85 million to 90 million units. U.S. economic growth is now projected to be in the 2% range as a result of downward revisions to first quarter growth. We continue to expect improving conditions through the balance of this year and have seen economic indicators and industry sales recovering in the second quarter.  In South America, Brazil continues to face inflationary pressures despite higher interest rates and weakening economic growth. The situation remains uncertain in Argentina and Venezuela. In Europe, an economic recovery is underway, with expected 2014 GDP growth of about 1% in the euro area and 2.5% to 3% in the U.K. Although not shown, the outlook for Russia is challenging and fluid, with weak GDP growth, inflationary pressures and a weaker currency.  In Asia Pacific, China's economic growth is projected in the 7.5% range. Recent incoming data suggest the economy is stabilizing. Growth in India is expected to improve modestly at about 5% from last year, as high inflation and higher interest rates remain impediments to stronger growth. The recent general elections in India have generated positive sentiment and opportunities for better growth in the near term.  Overall, despite challenges in emerging markets, we expect global economic growth to continue in 2014 and be supportive of our projection for higher global automotive industry volume this year.  Slide 22 recaps the guidance disclosed earlier for our business unit, as well as for our net interest expense. In summary, full year guidance deteriorated for South America, improved for Ford Credit, and is unchanged for the other business units.  Our company guidance for 2014 is detailed on slide 23. We now expect full year industry volume to range from 16.3 million to 16.8 million units in the U.S.; Europe 20 markets to range from 14.3 million to 14.8 million units; and China to be in the 23.3 million to 24.3 million unit range.  In terms of our financial performance, we continue to expect automotive revenue to be about equal to 2013 and automotive operating margin to be lower than 2013. We now expect automotive operating related cash flow to be lower than 2013, improved from substantially lower. This includes capital spending of about $7.5 billion to support new or significantly refreshed products and capacity actions.  We also now expect Ford Credit pretax profit to be higher than 2013, improved from about equal to higher than 2013. We continue to expect company pretax profit to be in the $7 billion to $8 billion range, in a period with an unprecedented number of global launches.  Overall, 2014 will be a solid year for Ford Motor Company and a critical next step forward in implementing our ONE Ford plan to continue delivering profitable growth for all. The payoff from in the 2014 launches and investments will be a strong product lineup with higher volumes, revenues and margins in 2015 and beyond.  In closing, our ONE Ford plan is built on compelling vision, a comprehensive strategy and relentless implementation, all leading to profitable growth around the world. We remain fully focused on continuing the success of our ONE Ford plan, in fact accelerating our pace of progress. We delivered strong results in the second quarter, and we remain on track in implementing our plan for the full year, including continued strength from North America, although down from recent years as we launch three times the number of products as last year; a loss in South America, as we adjust to a changed environment and continued risk in the region; successful execution of our transformation plan for Europe, as we progress towards profitability in 2015, even as we work through challenges primarily in Russia; establishing our Middle East and Africa business unit; continued strong growth and profitability in Asia Pacific; consistent, solid performance from our Ford Credit operations, and positive automotive operating-related cash flow.  So now let's open it up to your questions. George. George Sharp : Thanks Mark. Now we\u2019ll open the lines for about a 45 minute Q-&-A session. We\u2019ll begin with questions from the investment community and then take questions from the media. Now in order to allow us as many participants as possible within this time frame, please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two. Kanti, can we have the first question, please? Operator : Okay George. (Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of George Galliers from ISI. Please go ahead George. George Galliers - ISI: Hello. Sorry, I\u2019m having telephone issues. I have two questions; the first was just on South American production. I notice you have it stepping up sequentially in Q3. Is this due to normal seasonality? It\u2019s just, when I look back at last year and also 2011, it looks like Q3 is down on Q2. So just wondering if you could elaborate on why you have production up in Q3 in that region.  The second one is just with respect to the restructuring charges in Europe. Would you be able to give a breakout of how much is in relation to the reserve release and how much relates to the write-off? Mark Fields : Thanks George. I\u2019ll take your first question and then Bob will take your second one. The step-up on production from the second quarter to third quarter in South America is due to the launch of our new K-A or Ka, which is a very important launch for us as it represents over 50% of the segment. That segment represents 50% of the industry in places like Brazil and the initial response we've gotten back since we have at least publicly shown it has been very encouraging, so we are looking forward to getting that into the marketplace and allowing that to help grow our business and also some pricing in the third quarter and the second half of this year in South America. Bob, you want to take the second one? Bob Shanks : Yes, in terms of restructuring charges George, if you look at slide 14 to the far right, you can see on a year-over-year basis we had $178 million of good news from lower restructuring charges. So within that the reserve release which was related to the agreement that we made with the German Works Council was worth about $60 million, $65 million of good news, and that will be one time and won't repeat in the subsequent quarters.  And then what we had a year ago was a reserve write-off of about $40 million to $45 million related to our facility at Genk, and so that\u2019s not repeating. So the two of those, you put them together, you get about $100 million of good news on a year-over-year basis within that $178 million. So we are still expecting to have about $250 million of restructuring costs for the full year and we still have obviously more of that in front of us than behind us. So that will be one of the factors that will drive the second half to be lower than the first half in terms of overall results. George Galliers - ISI: Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And we have the next question. It comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please go ahead. Brian Johnson - Barclays: Yes, good morning, and congratulations again Mark on your first quarter and call. In North America you said pricing was going to be positive for the year. It looks like first half was $100 million positive. Do you expect more price in the second half or with some of the model changeovers, is this kind of going to be what we see for the year? Bob Shanks : Yes Brian, I\u2019ll take that one. In the first half, if you go all the way back to December, if you remember when we had our initial guidance for the year, we actually thought that pricing would be adverse and in the first quarter we said it could be sort of flat to somewhat positive, and I think that\u2019s what we are seeing play out in the first half. That\u2019s consistent with what we expected at that time.  When we get into the second half, I think we\u2019ll see more opportunities on pricing related to the new products, because as you very well know we\u2019ve got a number of new products coming. Now a lot of that volume, because there\u2019s a lot of (inaudible), actually the big effect is going to be in 2015. But there will be some benefit that we\u2019ll get from that into the second half, so I would think that would be a positive for us in the second half versus the first half. Brian Johnson - Barclays: And also on North America, on the cost side, I mean we\u2019ve become accustomed to seeing cost pressures coming up, and this was a fairly good cost improvement. Is that kind of cost improvement going to be sustainable going forward or are there various one-off or timing differences we ought to be aware of as we think about the pace of structural and content cost through the year? Bob Shanks : Well, I think in the case of overall cost, we usually do see a cost increase just typically in the second half versus first half. Some of that is seasonality; some of that is the fact that we are in a growth mode, so our CapEx will increase; we\u2019ll have launches that are going to hit the second half more than they did in the first half.  On the product, the material cost piece, within that in the second quarter, pretty benign in terms of material costs on a year-over-year basis. I think that is just because we are in sort of the quiet period if you will. We haven't had a lot of big launches over the last year. We\u2019ve got the big launches ahead of us in the second half. So, I think we\u2019ve benefited from the fact that the normal, very strong material cost reductions that we get from design changes and/or from our work with our supplier partners, more of that is just flowing through in the quarter than what would probably be typical, and certainly more is flowing through than what you would see in the second half, because of the added product costs that will come.  But again, with those product costs, that\u2019s new product, new features, new technologies, so we\u2019ll also get more pricing. So you have to kind of think about all that together. Mark Fields : And just to add to that Brian on the structural cost, as Bob said, to put it into perspective, we are in growth mode. We can assure you that we\u2019re being very thoughtful about the structural costs that we put into the business. We spend a lot of time as a management team looking at the breakeven levels, so we don't get ahead of ourselves, if you will. But we are very focused on that, just as we are focused on driving the top line of the business. Brian Johnson - Barclays: Okay, thanks. Operator : And we have the next question and it comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please proceed. Colin Langan - UBS: Thanks for taking my questions. Can you give me any color? Last quarter you mentioned that you thought the high end of your North America margin guidance of 8% to 9% was possible if you could get more pickup production out. How are you thinking about that currently? Bob Shanks : Well, we're not saying it is not possible; but we are just staying with the overall guidance of 8% to 9%, because we\u2019ve got all these big launches coming ahead of us and what we\u2019d like to do is take a save and revisit that after we get through particularly the F-150 launch, which based on what we\u2019ve guided today in terms of down which is now just right at our doorstep.  So we feel extremely good about the margins. You can look at that first half number; it\u2019s extremely strong. The launch of the F-150, and Mark can comment, is going well, as well as our other launches, so there is nothing at this point to be concerned about. So we feel good about it, but I think we\u2019ll just kind of update you if you will at the third quarter, once we get through the heart of the launch. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay, that makes sense. Can you also give some color on Asia Pacific? It was down quite a bit sequentially and you\u2019re guiding it down in the second half. I know you warned last quarter not to annualize the Q1 result, but what were the major factors when we think about it quarter-over-quarter. I think it\u2019s down about $130 million? Bob Shanks : Yes, I mean, there's really two things to think about. Actually, I\u2019ll mention three. If you go to slide 17 and look below the chart, which gives you the quarter-to-quarter, we are still getting top-line growth; but within the contribution cost we had an increase in our warranty reserves, which largely explains that. So that would be, if you think about it, it should be one-time.  In the other cost what you have got there is ongoing investments in growth. So as I mentioned, we have five plants still under construction and just take India for example. The Sanand facility that will open next year, we are already bringing hourly labor onboard. We are training them, so if you will, there\u2019s costs associated with that. Plus the other plants in China that there is no revenue for obviously, so that\u2019s a factor.  We are already incurring cost as well for the Lincoln launch that will occur in the fall. So that's ahead of us as well, but also affecting the quarter and then if you go to the very far right Colin, look at Other. Within that we had a non-repeat of a favorable insurance adjustment in Thailand. I believe that's just not repeating, so that's sort of the factors that are affecting us.  But just broadly, if you step back and go back to the comments around North America, I think the growth story is even of greater effect in Asia Pacific, and you can see that from the top line. We are investing and continuing to invest heavily and so that\u2019s bringing cost with it, but very strong revenue and growth that we are expecting in periods ahead. Mark Fields : And just to add a little bit more context to your question around the Asia Pacific business and what\u2019s the trajectory, besides the financials and the comments that Bob just made, when you look across the region, nine out of our 12 markets in the second quarter actually grew their market share. So we are really pleased with the response to our ONE Ford products. And in China in particular, with the record market share, we are getting a lot of growth in the tier 4 through six cities, where there\u2019s a lot of growth and it's married to our network strategy. The consumers that we are attracting in China are younger, more educated and higher-income customers than the industry average and our retail sales, 70% to 90% of our retail sales come from either first time buyers or people buying an additional vehicle. So fundamentally, we think this positions us well for growth going forward. Colin Langan - UBS: Okay, all right. Thank you very much. Operator : And we have the next question and it comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Great, thank you very much. So two questions for me. Number one is just following up on, I think it was Brian Johnson that asked the question on the slide 7, the materials excluding commodities benefit of $483 million. Obviously substantial tailwind there, and I get that you're going through a little bit of a quiet period before the launch of a lot of new product, but is that kind of reflective of just some of the purchasing efficiencies from global platforms that are kind of flowing through, all things equal or is there anything unusual that might have been a support to that this particular quarter?  And then I had just a second question on Brazil. Can you guys maybe just with respect to your new guidance, maybe tease out how you are thinking about the commercial vehicle business that you have there, versus the light vehicle and how much each is kind of contributing to that sort of change in outlook if you will? Bob Shanks : Why don't I take the first one and Mark, do you want to take the second one? Yes, I don't think there\u2019s anything unusual and one-time or anything of that sort in the quarter. I really do believe Patrick that it\u2019s really the fact that we\u2019ve got the strong efficiencies around material costs coming from the work with the supply base, as well as with the work in terms of design efficiencies. But it\u2019s just flowing more straight through to the bottom line than what you might expect in an ongoing quarter, because of just where we find ourselves with the launches, both behind us, but also the ones ahead of us.  When you do look at the second half, as I mentioned, it clearly is going to be an adverse factor, at least based on what we\u2019re looking at today compared with the first half. But we also would expect to get some of that back within contribution costs from better performance in terms of warranty cost, particularly given what happened in the first quarter, but also maybe some improvements in freight and distribution as well, which in part was one of the issues with the added cost we had in the first quarter related to weather.  So I think overall sort of a negative if you will in the second half versus first half on material, but a positive in some of the other factors. So I think they will more or less wash out when we look at North America second half to first half. Mark Fields : And Patrick, on your second question around Brazil, when you stand back and look at the business, as we mentioned earlier, clearly we are continuing in implementing our ONE Ford plan where we are replacing all the legacy products, including some of our commercial vehicles, our cargo that we launched last year, which is actually doing very well in the marketplace.  But the second half of the year in Brazil is really due to the economic slowdown that we\u2019ve seen and also to exchange volatility, and in some cases just dollar availability in places like Argentina and Venezuela. Specifically to the Brazil industry and your question around commercial vehicles, we are seeing the industry down overall, especially large and a big load of trucks where we don't specifically play. We are more in the medium truck segment of that right now. So the team is on top of this. We are looking at the business environment, understanding what do we need to do to improve the situation in a very changeable market, and we\u2019ll continue to work our process on that and maximize our results in a changeable environment. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs : Okay, terrific. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Thank you. And we have the next question. It comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley : Hey, thanks everybody. Just one question for Mark and one question for Mike Seneski, if he\u2019s still on the call. So Mark, when you look into the meat of the F-150 changeover, given the really unprecedented nature of the material substitution at this scale, and I know Ford has tremendous experience with aluminum, but this is completely unprecedented at the scale you are attempting it.  Would it be unreasonable to allow a little extra margin of safety for you to prioritize absolutely perfect top-quality initial production, body integrity, etc., for those first units, even if it means a slower ramp? Because your tone on the changeover, it sounds so confident that I can't help but be a little skeptical or are we really able to properly judge the changeover before we actually switch the full machinery on and start putting the scanners on the bodies coming off the line? That\u2019s my first question.  And the second, Mike, I know that the mood has been kind of all systems go on credit for quite a while, but if I forced you to pick one market development on the credit side, and I'm not referring to Ford specifically, but just the overall market, if I force you to pick one development that concerned you the most, could you think of anything? What would it be? Thanks. Mark Fields : Thanks Adam, thanks for the question and let me get to the first part on F-150. We are very excited about the F-150 launch and as you know, we are absolutely committed to delivering top quality in all of our vehicles and all of our launches. And I have to tell you, the innovative approaches that the team is taking to this launch are very, very comforting to us, and that we are going through the builds right now. I happened to drive a prototype last night. So the vehicles are coming together very well. But when you look at some of the things the teams have done to your point, to ensure quality, how we\u2019ve tested the tools out, literally online before they are actually installed in their body shop, the riveting process and adhesive process that this is going to use, we're actually using that on pilot production, so it\u2019s running on current production right now for over a year now, so the team has a lot of experience on that.  So when you stand back, when you look at it from today's perspective, we feel confident that our development and try-out processes have positioned us well to be ready for an on-time launch with quality.  So for the second question, Mike, you want to take that? Mike Seneski : Yes Adam, I\u2019ll start by saying and you will see it on the fixed income call later. Our business continues to perform extraordinarily well. As you know, our standard line, our origination practices haven't changed, and we feel very good about the performance of our portfolio and what we are originating. The entire auto financing market, it really is a balance. You said pick one thing; I don't know what the one thing is. Leasing is pretty high. You are seeing extended terms grow, and you are seeing subprime grow. So with that, if there\u2019s big changes in variable marketing strategies, if there\u2019s big spikes in interest rates, those are the types of things that are going to create imbalances. The goal is to manage that and manage that within a construct that optimizes your risk appetite, and that\u2019s what we think we\u2019re doing in Ford Credit. Adam Jonas - Morgan Stanley : Thanks Mike. Thanks Mark. Mark Fields : Thanks. Operator : And we have the next question. It comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the Asia Pac build-out. I know you said costs will be a little bit higher; you've got a lot of plants coming on. Unless I\u2019m mistaken, I think that bleeds into \u201815. So should we expect those costs while they may ebb and flow per quarter, to persist for about another year? Bob Shanks : Well, I think until we see an end of growth, and frankly we don't, we\u2019ll continue to find opportunities to invest in the business. So if you go back and look at the last number of years, we\u2019ve been consistently seeing an increase in structural costs, but going back to Mark's earlier comment, it\u2019s all been very well planned, very thought through, connected directly to revenue growth that we expect to get from that and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening.  Now what you\u2019re seeing is the balance between the costs and the revenue are starting to shift. So in the past it was costs and revenue ahead of us. Now you are starting to see some of that revenue come on stream. It\u2019s exceeding the cost, so we are starting to see the good, strong results and I think that change of balance will continue as we move forward.  So I think you will see cost increases. Well, you definitely will see cost increases in the second half versus the first half which I already mentioned. For the reasons I mentioned, some seasonality, but also the continued investment. I would expect that would continue as we go into the forward years, as long as we find opportunities to grow the business, but the top line will grow more. Joe Spak - RBC Capital Markets : Right. And then just in Europe, everything seems a little bit better. I know you expressed some caution over Russia. Is it fair to say that even though the outlook is unchanged, maybe core or sort of Western Europe is a little bit better and Russia is maybe dragging that down a little bit? Mark Fields : Well, overall when you look at our performance this year and our goal for profitability for 2015, at this point we don't see issues in Russia affecting our ability to reach profitability in 2015. Clearly when you look at Russia, the current environment is difficult. But it's a big, it's an important market, and it has the potential as you know to be the largest market in Europe over time, and the business environment right now as Bob mentioned earlier, it\u2019s very challenging and fluid. You got GDP that\u2019s slowing down, which is affecting the industry sales; the weak ruble; the segment shifts of consumers from cars to some of the SUVs and of course overlaid by the geopolitical issues.  So we are working with our partners in Ford Sollers to improve the business outlook, take the appropriate actions. The team is on it, and the senior team is meeting very regularly on this and just using our process of always looking at that business environment and understanding what do we have to do to maximize or minimize impacts on the business. Operator : We have the next question and it comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please proceed. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan: Hi, good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Mark Fields : Thanks Ryan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan: So, I think that the profit in Europe obviously stands out for investors today. It looked like a lot of the improvement in 2Q and so far for you there it relates really to the contribution and structural cost lines, I guess explained by lower restructuring cost and now restructuring savings.  In some of our previous conversations though, I think you suggested that the turnaround in Europe also hinges upon stronger pricing, which we haven't seen a whole lot of yet. I believe you have the goal of pricing comparably in the market to a brand like Volkswagen, sort of similar to how you price as well or stronger than Toyota in the U.S. now. So is it fair that the improvement in Europe this year is still going to be more about the cost and restructuring side? When do we see the pricing benefits? Is that more of a 2015 thing? And maybe if you could just take a moment to walk us through your strategy to get better priced in Europe, talk a little bit about the product push and maybe some of these headlines that we are seeing about this Vignale branding? Thanks. Bob Shanks : Yes, I think you\u2019re right. The overall transformation plan, which is very much on track was around the three things that I referenced earlier in the upfront comments, around the brand product and cost, and we are seeing progress in all those fronts.  The brand favorability is improving. The team is doing a great job on the network and working with our dealers and their go-to-market strategies. In terms of product, we\u2019ve had quite a number of products that have launched successfully.  We\u2019ve got more ahead of us and as part of that, if you remember our conversations on that, it\u2019s also to start to kind of if you will, pull the average of the portfolio higher in terms of overall mix and that will come from products that include imports from other parts of Ford, such as the next-generation Edge, the Mustang and other things that we\u2019ve got coming. The Vignale series that Mark touched on earlier, that\u2019s another part of our strategy to move sort of the center of gravity of the portfolio up.  We\u2019ve sort of held our line this year, year-over-year in terms of pricing and that\u2019s an environment that still is very difficult in terms of where everyone is struggling to get that extra unit in a market that\u2019s still quite low, although it's improved from where it had been. And I think as you go forward, we expect as more of the new product gets out, we continue to work on all of these aspects of our brand and the overall business that we\u2019ll start to be able to see more of the improvement in the pricing area above the line, if you will. But I think we feel kind of good about where we are and we might see a little bit of improvement in the second half versus the first half as we get more of the new products out there, like the Mondeo, but yes, that\u2019s part of the plan and we feel pretty much on track with regard to it. Mark? Mark Fields : Yes Ryan, just to put a couple more things to that, we are confident in the trajectory that we are on in Europe for the reasons Bob mentioned. In addition, our plan has always revolved around product, brand and cost and as you pointed out, the team is making very good progress on cost.  As Bob mentioned, brand is doing well in terms of favorable opinion and on the product side, interestingly enough, when you look at our sales in the first half of this year, over 50% of our sales are on these new products that we\u2019ve introduced over the last year or so. So we think that bodes well. Our retail percent of the industry is higher as a percentage of our sales than the rest of the industry.  So we\u2019re really pleased by the response from our European consumers, and with the products coming up, the Focus, the Mondeo, two very important, high-volume products and in some cases high-image products, followed by the Mustang, the Edge, and the Vignale series, we think positions us well for growth going forward and also buttressed by our commercial business, with our full revamp of the entire Transit lineup.  We\u2019ve had the highest share in the first half of this year since 1997 I believe, and I think that will also bode well to allow the business to grow and allow us to achieve our profitability in 2015, which is obviously a very important goal for us. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan: Okay, great, thanks. Very helpful, and for my second and last question, on the really strong results in China, obviously great volume and share improvement; I\u2019m curious if you can give us a sense of the margins you earn there on your joint ventures. I think investors tried to claim some understanding by examining Changan\u2019s financials.  Is there anything you can say on the margins now and also where you think that they can go? Is there any reason why you couldn't achieve the type of margins over time in that country, that say GM and Volkswagen currently earn? What are the gives and takes there? Maybe you don't have the luxury exposure, but presumably you've got a lot of SUV exposure, which is presumably high margin and I know you hope to grow Lincoln over time. Bob Shanks : Yes. We haven't disclosed those types of details, but I will tell you Ryan that the margins that we\u2019re getting from our joint ventures in China are extremely healthy and I think we can aspire to the types of margins that you are seeing from other competitors there.  The business is very well structured. We are managing extremely well supply and demand; if anything, we kind of struggle to keep up with the demand. As Mark and I both mentioned, the brand is very well regarded in the market, so it's just kind of positives all around.  So I think margin is extremely healthy and I think they can potentially even be healthier as we continue to kind of fill out the portfolio. Again, improve the overall mix as we add higher priced vehicles.  I should also mention that we\u2019ve also got a pretty healthy import business as well. Products such as the Explorer; the Edge is coming in, and of course Lincoln we have a lot of great expectations of, and that will clearly be a plus for the business. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan: Great, thanks. Congrats again. Mark Fields : Thank you. Operator : And we have the next question. It comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Please proceed. John Murphy - Bank of America : Good morning guys. Mark Fields : Hey John. John Murphy - Bank of America : Just a first question on CapEx at $7.5 billion this year. That includes a lot of expansion o investment, particularly in China. I'm presuming some of that does level off a little bit as we get into \u201815 and \u201816. Do you think you could pull back on CapEx or do you think you might just level it out at these levels, even on a base of a larger business? I\u2019m just trying to understand the context of CapEx going forward, when we get through this big growth spurt. Bob Shanks : Yes, I wouldn't assume that the CapEx level is off, because we\u2019ve got some really great and exciting growth plans for the business, so we\u2019ll continue to invest as long as we see those opportunities.  One thing I just want to caution you on is that the investments in China are largely made by the joint ventures, which don't show up in our CapEx. That would be incremental if you will. We might have some more to say on this on Investor Day, which we sent out a notice on that for September 29, but yes, I wouldn\u2019t build into your models that the CapEx is going to be declining or flattening out. John Murphy - Bank of America : Okay, and then just a second question. Traditionally, the Expedition and Navigator have come just about a year after the F-150 launch and off the same platform and I was just curious, as we think about this going forward, I\u2019m presuming the F-150 goes as well as you\u2019re expecting.  That seems like that would come a year after and the benefits of the light-weighting and mass reduction that you are executing on the F-150 might be even more important on a large SUV, because on a large SUV with a 30 mpg or close to that, would resonate pretty big with consumers, to get a vehicle that large with that kind of mpg and hauling seven, eight kids around is something that a lot of people would like in this country. I\u2019m just curious if you can comment on that or there would be any reason that there will be a change in the platform strategy between the F-150 and the Expedition and Navigator. Mark Fields : Thanks John. I\u2019m still getting my head around eight to nine kids that you're hauling around, but\u2026 John Murphy - Bank of America : Well yes, but that's not me. That's not \u2013 sorry. Mark Fields : That being said, as you know we are just coming out with a major refresh in Expedition and Navigator and clearly we\u2019re very excited about bringing those products to our customers. Not at liberty to talk about our product plans going forward, but clearly as you look at our ONE Ford plan and our whole approach of looking at platforms, looking at trying to get reductions in those platforms to get scale efficiencies, to provide even greater value to our customers, is something that we are going to continue to execute as a company, and that\u2019s about all I can say at this point. John Murphy - Bank of America : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Mark Fields : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And now we\u2019ll take questions from the media section. (Operator Instructions). And we have a question from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin from AP. Please go ahead. Please proceed. Dee-Ann Durbin - AP: Good morning, Mark. Thanks for taking the call, and I\u2019ll stick with two kids too by the way. I\u2019m hearing a lot of Mulallyisms in your comments this morning, relentless implementation, compelling vision and it makes me wonder what we should be looking for in terms of your own mark on the company. What are we going to see in the remainder of this year and beyond that signals there\u2019s new leadership? Mark Fields : Well, it's a great question Dee-Ann. I think just to put things in perspective, I had the opportunity to sit side-by-side with Alan for the last eight years in terms of developing the strategy and then the implementation of that. So the indication that there has to be a new strategy, because there\u2019s a new person sitting in the chair, I wouldn't necessarily assume that.  My message to our team internally and now externally is one of continuity, but also acceleration of our plan, of our working together, the way we run the company, our product passion, bringing even more innovations to the marketplace and I think that message of continuity and acceleration resonates with our team, particularly in an environment where there is lots going on in the industry, lots going on around the world and we can stay very focused on those things that have brought us to this point as a company and provides us a great foundation to move the company forward. Dee-Ann Durbin - AP: Thank you. Mark Fields : Thanks Dee-Ann. Operator : And we have the next question from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA. Please proceed. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA: Hi, good morning everybody. I think I\u2019m still part of the analyst group, not the media, but I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re taking my question, so thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask you a little bit more specifically on the timing of the cost and benefits from the launch of the F-150. You gave a lot of good detail on when the downtime would be. Now the eight weeks seem to be falling nicely half-and-half between 3Q and 4Q, but then there\u2019s some summer shutdowns in the third quarter and then on the other hand in the fourth quarter there may be some production already of the new ones and high pricing. How do you think about between 3Q and 4Q, if there is any strong difference in terms of North American cost and profitability? Bob Shanks : I\u2019ll answer that and if Mark has anything to add, he will follow. But the way I guess I would think about it is third quarter is the launch quarter and I\u2019m talking about the new F-150, because remember, all the way through this, all the way through the third and fourth quarter, Kansas City is still producing the present F-150 until it gets to its own launch in the first half of next year. So that continues apace, so we are able to continue to supply the dealers with that product, which transaction prices continue to be highest in the segment and we are just doing extremely well with that, even in the balance out, so that continues.  In Dearborn, I would think of third quarter as launch, because we\u2019ve already mentioned that much of the quarter will be actually not producing anything as we transition to the new products and some of that continues in the early fourth. There will be units that will be released to dealers in the quarter and so that will be a benefit, but I would clearly think about the real impact of F-150 on the bottom line as being more of a \u201815 phenomenon than a \u201814 phenomenon, the new F-150. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA: Understood, and so any major differences in profitability between three and fourth quarter or are we just assuming from now on this is sort of like the launch and then the benefit is in 2015? Bob Shanks : There will be an impact in both quarters from the launch, but you\u2019ll have more of those down weeks I believe in the third quarter than you\u2019ll have in the fourth quarter. And clearly when we are down, we are not producing, so the profit effect would be a little bit greater in terms of the launch cost, launch effect in the third quarter than the fourth quarter. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA: Okay, now that's very clear. And then just back to Asia Pacific and I guess specifically China, you\u2019ve done a phenomenal job growing market share from what used to be about 3% or so a couple of years ago to now some 4.6% in the second quarter. At the same time, when we look at sort of like share growth, it\u2019s been really good, but it sort of like seems to be stabilizing around these levels. You did 4.6% this quarter; it was 4.5% last quarter; it was 4.3% just a year ago in the second quarter, and a lot of your new product has actually already come out in China.  There is obviously much more production facility to come; but in terms of the introductions I see a lot of it has come in. Do you still expect a 6% market share that\u2019s sort of like the achievable goal in the near term? I think that used to be your 2015 goal, and if so, how did you get there? Bob Shanks : Well, we have more new products coming, so we are clearly not finished with the product. We have quite a bit more new product coming over the next few years and looking for additional opportunities. We have more capacity coming and the way I think about the share improvement and actually its I think a couple years ago; it might have been more in the 2%-ish range, and again that's 2% of a massive industry remember, so the absolutes in terms of the volumes are quite large.  But I would go back to a comment Mark made in reference to something else. I would think about the share improvement as relentless implementation and execution. We are just going to just keep growing and growing and just hope to see that relentless coming through in our bottom line, as well as in our share improvement.  So we are not trying to win in a burst. This is sort of a marathon, and we\u2019re going to just keep going forward and keep growing and leverage every opportunity that we can find. So we celebrate two or three-tenths; it's great. Operator : And we have a next question. It comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Hi everybody. Mark Fields : Hey Rod. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Hey. Just to Murphy's question, if you got eight or nine kids, you might want to rename the vehicle from Expedition to Evacuation. Mark Fields : We already have a vehicle named Escape, so\u2026 Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Yes, that's true. Well, when do we get the specs for the fuel economy on the new F-150 and when is the initial shipping release date to dealers? I know you guys tend to hold a bit of inventory initially as part of the quality process. And also on North America, are you still \u2013 I would imagine you are, but you did explicitly mention last quarter that you were expecting North American margins potentially to hit the upper end of the guidance. Mark Fields : Okay, when you look at the number of the questions, Rod we go to manufacturing launch in the fourth quarter, so you\u2019ll start to see some units show up at dealerships by the end of the year and we are very excited about making sure that we do that.  From the second question around the fuel economy, as you saw yesterday, we announced the capability figures for the vehicle, which were very well received. We are working through our normal process on fuel economy, in terms of looking at the labels and making sure they get certified. So you\u2019ll see that in the next number of weeks as we close out on that process and follow that process with the EPA. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank : Okay, and just two other quickly. In Europe your contribution costs have been improving despite the new product. Can you just comment on the sustainability of that and in South America, the structural costs have been on the rise. What\u2019s the plan to address that aspect of the profit outlook? Bob Shanks : Yes, just two things. First of all, on the European question, I would expect us to start to see added product costs coming in there with the launch of the Mondeo and the Focus. So we\u2019ll continue to see good results in terms of our material cost reductions, but you will start to see, just as I talked about for North America, you\u2019ll start to see product costs start to come through there.  In the case of South America, that\u2019s an interesting question. To some extent you do see in those numbers what you see in the other business units, which is the investments for growth as we continue to transition the portfolio to the global ONE Ford products, but a lot of this is the effect of high local inflation. You\u2019ve got inflation in a 50%, 60% range in Venezuela. What is it, Joe? 30%, 40% or something like that in Argentina; 6% in Brazil.  So really when you're looking at South America, you have to look at that pricing number, which looks great. But you have to at the same time look within the cost increases, including material cost, because you see a lot of negative commodity cost coming through, because its dollar based and so in that particular region it comes through as a cost increase, because of the impact of the weaker currency.  So there is that inflation effect and then you\u2019ve got the exchange effect. It\u2019s just they are all related to each other. And as I mentioned in the comments earlier, we aren't actually, even with the pricing, fully offsetting the effect of inflation through the income statement and adverse operating exchange. So you got to look at all those three together. Operator : And we have a next question and it comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citigroup. Please proceed. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup: Great, thanks, good morning. So first question on North America margins, in the next few quarters we clearly have some noise with the F-150 launch. But you did do a 9.5% margin in the first half, maybe even north of 10% excluding the warranty. Is the first half a good baseline for us to model for 2015 once you get through all the launches or are there some things going on this year versus next year that might not create that as a good baseline for modeling purposes? Bob Shanks : Itay, all I would say is what we\u2019ve said consistently for quite some time, is that we see the business in North America as capable of and targeting an 8% to 10% margin over time. And this year as you said, in the first half, 9.5%, but clearly we\u2019ve guided that for second for a number of different reasons, including seasonality will be lower, but still strong, but we see it at 8% to 9% and I think that is what I would assume as I\u2019m looking at the forward years. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup: Great. And then the second question, just a big picture on Asia Pacific. It looks like based on your guidance you\u2019ll probably maybe be at pretax profits of roughly $700 million, about double where you were last year. I know the mid-decade outlook is for that region to contribute very meaningfully. Maybe you can just help us with the overall glide path to kind of what roughly very meaningfully sort of means and then how should we think about that glide path over the next, let's say year or two? Bob Shanks : Yes, I think we\u2019ll take a save on that. Well, maybe that\u2019s something that we\u2019ll touch on at Investor Day, because I\u2019d like to keep the focus today on this year and the quarter. But clearly, what you said about where this business is going is how we are seeing it and how we are thinking about it, but I don't think I\u2019d get into it any further than that today. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup: Okay, great. We\u2019ll look forward to the September Investor Day. Thanks a lot. Bob Shanks : Okay, great. See you then. Operator : That was our last question. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. George Sharp for closing remarks. George Sharp : Okay, terrific. Thanks everyone. That will wrap up today's presentation. We are really glad that you were able to join us. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference call. This concludes your presentation for today. Now you may disconnect. Thank you for joining. Have a very good day.",

My name is Glenn and I will be your event manager for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode, and later we will facilitate a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. George Sharp, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, Mr. Sharp. George Sharp : Thank you, Glenn, and good morning. Welcome to everyone joining us today either by phone or by webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for taking the time [Technical Difficulty] third quarter 2014 financial results. Now presenting today are Mark Fields, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, our Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO. Now copies of this morning\u2019s press release and presentation slides are available on our Investor and Media websites. The financial results discussed today are preliminary and include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Now any non-GAAP measure is reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck, and final data will be included in our Form 10-Q. Finally, today\u2019s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford\u2019s future performance, of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect our future results are summarized at the end of the presentation and detailed in our SEC filings. With that, I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mark. Mark Fields : Thanks, George. Today we will review our third quarter financial results, the details behind them, and our outlook ahead. So let\u2019s get right into the first slide. Our results this quarter are underpinned, once again by our ONE Ford plan which remains unchanged. We are continuing to focus on all four elements of our plan; they served us well and will continue to be our focus going forward. We also plan to build on our success by accelerating the pace of progress throughout our business. In many ways we are just starting to see the full benefits and strength of ONE Ford and we intend to maximize these opportunities going forward. At the same time, we are passionate about product excellence and leading in innovation. We are committed to building on the product strength today, with even more new products and innovations that will deliver growth for our stakeholders and define our company going forward. So now let\u2019s turn to Slide 2 for a look at the third quarter. The third quarter was our 21st consecutive profitable quarter and we ended the period with strong liquidity. Automotive operating related cash flow however was negative due to unfavorable changes in the working capital, including product launch effects. Third quarter wholesale volume and revenue declined year-over-year by 3% and 2% respectively. Market share however was higher in Europe and our third quarter record in Asia Pacific, where we once again delivered a record share in China. North America and Asia Pacific were profitable where pre-tax results were lower than a year ago for all of our automotive business units, except Middle East and Africa. Ford Credit delivered strong results that were better than a year ago. Company\u2019s pre-tax profit was in line with our expectation and consistent with the guidance we provided at the September Investor Day of company full year pre-tax profit of about $6 billion which we are reconfirming today. It was however, lower than a year ago. This is more than explained by three factors; lower volume, higher warranty costs, and adverse balance sheet exchange effects. The lower volume was in North America, reflecting product launch effects and part shortages due to supplier issues, and in South America where industry sales declined due to the deteriorating external conditions. The higher warranty costs were mainly in North America, and were primarily due to recalls. And finally the adverse balance sheet exchange effects were largely in South America and accounted for about one-third of the regions lower profit. Looking ahead, 12 of our 23 global product launches are now complete and the balance are continuing to progress, including the all new F-150. And these launches along with the 16 planned for 2015 are expected to result next year in higher revenue, improved operating margin, and a company pre-tax profit of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion. So let\u2019s turn to Slide 3 to recap some of the quarter\u2019s other achievements. Other third quarter highlights include the start of production of several products, including the all-new 2015 Mustang, and the Lincoln MKZ, and MKC for China. We also announced the new C-MAX, brand C-MAX and S-MAX in Europe. We also announced that we\u2019re bringing 25 new vehicles to Middle East and Africa by 2016. Seven Ford vehicles finished in the Top Three of their segment in the J.D. Power and Fuel Study with F-150 and super duty F-250 and F-350 ranking highest in their segments. We hosted the industry\u2019s first App Developer Conference, and we were active in job creating including new jobs in Kansas City, Louisville, and Asia Pacific to support our growth initiatives. Finally, we completed our previously announced share repurchase program that reduced our diluted shares by about 3%. So now I\u2019ll turn it over to Bob who will take us through our financial results. Bob? Bob Shanks : Thanks, Mark, and good morning everyone. Let\u2019s start at the top on Slide 4, third quarter wholesale volume was 1.5 million units, down 52,000 units from a year ago; and revenue was $34.9 billion, down $900 million. Pre-tax profit was $1.2 billion, excluding special items; $1.4 billion lower than a year ago. After-tax earnings per share at $0.24 were $0.21 lower. Net income attributable to Ford, including pre-tax special item charges was $835 million, [Technical Difficulty] year ago. Earnings were $0.21 a share, down $0.10. Pre-tax special item charges were $160 million in the quarter reflecting separation related actions largely in Europe to support our transformation plan. Automotive operating related cash flow was negative $700 million, and automotive gross cash was $22.8 billion, exceeding debt by $7.9 billion. Our third quarter operating effective tax rate, which isn\u2019t shown was 31%, which is lower than our prior guidance. We continue to expect our full year operating effective tax rate to be about 35%, assuming retroactive extension of U.S. Research Credit Legislation in the fourth quarter. In the first nine months period vehicle wholesales were up slightly from a year ago, while the company revenue decreased by 1%. First nine months pre-tax operating profit excluding special items was $5.2 billion, a decline of $2.1 billion, and net income was $3.1 billion, $1 billion lower than a year ago. As shown on Slide 5, both our Automotive and Financial Services sectors contributed to the company\u2019s third quarter pre-tax profit. As shown in the memo, company\u2019s third quarter pre-tax profit declined compared to the prior year and prior quarter, both more than explained by automotive. The key market factors and financial metrics for our automotive business in the third quarter are shown on Slide 6. As you can see on the far left, wholesale volume and revenue decreased by 3% compared with a year ago. The lower volume is more than explained by an unfavorable change in dealer stocks related to product launch effects and supplier part shortages as well as declining industry volume in South America. Higher industry volumes in other regions were a partial offset. Global industry SAAR is estimated at 86.7 million units, up 3% from a year ago. And Ford\u2019s global market share is estimated at 7.4%, unchanged from a year ago. Operating margin was 2.5%, down 4.5 percentage points from a year ago, and automotive pre-tax profit was $686 million, down $1.5 billion. As shown in the memo below the chart, first nine months volume was up slightly from a year ago, while automotive revenue was down 2%. Operating margin at 4.2% was down two percentage points. Total automotive pre-tax profit at $3.8 billion was down $2.2 billion. The lower results were driven by North and South America, all other business units included. Slide 7 shows the factors that contributed to the $1.5 billion decline in third quarter automotive pre-tax profit. The lower profit is largely explained by higher warranty cost including recalls, mainly in North America, and lower volume in North and South America, as well as $166 million for the adverse balance sheet exchange effects, mainly in South America. All other factors largely offset each other. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was $1.5 billion lower than second quarter, largely explained by lower volume, mainly in North America and Europe, as well as higher warranty cost in North America. Slide 8 shows third quarter pre-tax results for each of our automotive operations, as well as Other Automotive. North America and Asia Pacific were profitable but the other business units reported losses. Other Automotive reflects net interest expense which we continue to expect to be about $700 million for the full year. Now we\u2019ll look at each of our regions within the automotive sector, starting on Slide 9 with North America. North America\u2019s continue to benefit from robust industry sales, our strong product line-up, continued discipline in matching production to demand, and a lean cost structure, but our third quarter results were affected adversely by higher warranty cost and lower volume. North America third quarter wholesale volume and revenue declined 8% and 6%, respectively. This decrease was explained primarily by product launch effects, including five weeks of downtime in the quarter at the Dearborn Truck Plant for the F-150 launch and supplier part shortages. U.S. third quarter industry SAAR was 17.2 million units, 1.1 million units higher than a year ago. Our U.S. market share deteriorated eight-tenth of a percentage point to 14.1%, reflecting a planned reduction in daily rental sales, and lower F-150 share as we prepare for the new vehicle by continuing to balance share, transaction prices, and stocks. As shown in appendix seven, our U.S. retail market share of the retail industry was 13%, down two-tenth of a percentage point from a year ago. North America\u2019s decline in revenue is more than explained by the lower wholesale volume. North America operating margin was 7.1%, down 3.8 percentage points from last year, and pre-tax profit was a $1.4 billion, down $886 million. Excluding the higher warranty costs which were entirely associated with recalls, North Americas operating margin would have been 10.2%. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first nine month metrics declined from the year ago with lower warranty \u2013 our lower volume and higher warranty costs including recalls more than explaining the lower operating margin and pre-tax profit. On Slide 10 we show the factors contributing to North America\u2019s lower third quarter pre-tax profit. The decline is more than explained by higher warranty cost and lower [Technical Difficulty] like the recent restraint control module recall announced last month, as well as reserve changes related to the other field service actions. As mentioned previously, product launch effects and supplier part shortages drove the lower volume. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was lower than second quarter, more than explained by unfavorable volume mix and higher warranty costs. Turning to full year guidance for North America, we continue to expect pre-tax profit to be lower than 2013, and operating margin to be at the low end of the 8% to 9% range. Alright, now let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and review South America, where we\u2019re continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product line-up, and have replaced legacy products with global ONE Ford offerings. We\u2019re also working to manage the effects of slowing GDP growth, declining industry volumes in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation, as well as policy uncertainty in some countries. In the third quarter wholesale volume and revenue decreased from the year ago by 21% and 17% respectively. The lower volume was explained primarily by a 700,000 unit decline from last year\u2019s SAAR of 5.7 million units. This reflects the impact of the weakening economy in Brazil, import restrictions in Argentina, and lower production in Venezuela, resulting from limited availability of U.S. dollars. Also contributing is a non-repeat of last year\u2019s stock build. South America market share at 8.8% was down four-tenths of a percentage point, more than explained by the phase-out of Fiesta Classic. The revenue decline is more than explained by the lower volume and weaker currencies, higher pricing was a partial offset. Operating margin was negative 7.3%, down significantly from a year ago and pre-tax loss was $170 million, a deterioration of $330 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first nine months metrics deteriorated from a year ago driven by the adverse change in external factors. The first nine month loss includes $426 million of adverse balance sheet exchange effects. On Slide 12 we show the factors contributing to the decline in South America\u2019s third quarter pre-tax results. The lower results were driven primarily by lower volume and adverse balance sheet exchange effects. As shown in the memo, pre-tax results improved compared with second quarter, more than explained by higher pricing and other effects associated with introduction of the new car in Brazil. Constant well received by media and initial reaction from customers is very encouraging. For the full year we continue to expect South America to incur a loss of about $1 billion. Let\u2019s turn now to Europe, beginning on Slide 13, where we continue to implement our transformation plan focused on product, brand and cost. Europe\u2019s wholesale volume and revenue improved from a year ago by 6% and 7% respectively. The higher volume reflects a 700,000 unit increase in Europe 20 SAAR to 14.5 million units, higher market share and lower dealer stock reductions than a year ago. Lower volumes in Russia and Turkey were partial offset. The focus on our transformation plan on improved product and brand led to great progress in the third quarter. Our Europe 20 market share improved four-tenths of a percentage point to 8.4%, this reflects two factors; a 0.5 percentage point improvement in our regional passenger share of the five major European markets to 8.8%, including the effect of our expanded SUV line-up. And secondly, a two percentage point improvement in our commercial vehicles share to 13%, reflecting the success of our full line of new Transit vehicles and continued strong performance of the Ranger compact pickup. The increase in Europe\u2019s revenue is explained by the higher volume in the Europe 20 markets. Europe\u2019s operating margin was negative 6.4%, down 3.6 percentage points from a year ago and pre-tax loss was $439 million, a $257 million decline. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first nine month metrics improved from a year ago. Slide 14 shows the factors that contributed to the decline in Europe\u2019s third quarter pre-tax results. The decline is more than explained by Russia, balance sheet exchange effects and other factors including lower component pricing and non-recurrence of prior year gains. As shown in the memo below the chart, pre-tax results were lower than second quarter. This is more than explained by lower volume due to Europe\u2019s seasonal plant shutdowns for summer holidays, unfavorable exchange, and higher cost including non-recurrence of a restructuring related reserve released last quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect a loss of $1.2 billion, an improvement compared with 2013. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 15 and review Middle East and Africa which is now its own geographic segment in order to facilitate better customer service, and further expand for its presence in this fast growing region. Middle East and Africa\u2019s wholesale volume and revenue improved from the year ago by 9% and 5% respectively. Operating margin was negative 1.4%, one percentage point better than year ago, and pre-tax loss was $15 million, $10 million better. As shown in the memo below the chart, first nine months wholesale volume and revenue deteriorated slightly compared with year ago, while operating margin and profit both improved. For the full year, we continue to expect Middle East and Africa results to be about [Technical Difficulty]. Right, let\u2019s now review Asia Pacific on Slide 16. Our strategy in Asia Pacific continues to be to invest for growth through both, new and expanded plants, new products, and the introduction of Lincoln in China. As shown on the left, third quarter wholesale volume was up 5% compared with a year ago, and net revenue which excludes our China joint ventures grew 3%. Our China wholesale volume, not shown, was up 10% in the quarter. The higher volume in the region is more than explained by higher market share and industry volume. We estimate third quarter SAAR for the region at 38.9 million units, up 1.8 million units from a year ago, explained primarily by China. Our market share at 3.6% was a record for the third quarter, and was two-tenths of a percentage point higher than a year ago. This was driven by China where our market share improved four-tenths of a percentage point to a record 4.7% reflecting continued strong sales across our vehicle line-up. Asia Pacific\u2019s higher revenue is more than explained by favorable mix. Operating margin was 1.7%, down 2.9 percentage points from a year ago, and pre-tax profit was $44 million, down $72 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, all first nine month metrics improved from a year ago. Slide 17 shows the decline in Asia Pacific\u2019s third quarter pre-tax profit. It\u2019s more than explained by higher structural cost and unfavorable exchange with favorable market factors being a partial offset. The higher structural cost reflects our continued investment in products and growth including five new plants that will come online over the next nine months, as well as the launch of Lincoln. As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific pre-tax results declined from second quarter, with most factors unfavorable. For the full year we continue to expect Asia Pacific to earn a pre-tax profit of about $700 million, which is higher than a year ago. Let\u2019s turn now on Slide 18 to Ford Credit, which is an integral part of our global growth and value creation strategy. Ford Credit provides world class dealer and customer financial services, supported by a strong balance sheet, providing solid profits and distributions to Ford. Ford Credit\u2019s higher pre-tax profit this quarter compared with the year ago is more than explained by a higher volume, this reflects increases in nearly all financing products including non-consumer and consumer finance receivables globally, as well as leasing in North America. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was higher than second quarter, explained primarily by a lower level of insurance losses in North America which is included in other. For the full year we continue to expect Ford Credit profits to be $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Our guidance for Ford Credit year end managed receivables and managed leverage also is unchanged. We now expect Ford Credits distributions to its parent to be about $400 million, up from our prior guidance of about $250 million. This increase is driven by higher net income at Ford Credit. Next on Slide 19 is our automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $22.8 billion, decreases of $3 billion from the end of the second quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was negative $700 million. This is more than explained by unfavorable changes in working capital including the effects of the five weeks of downtime in the quarter at the Dearborn Truck Plant as we transition to the new F-150 as well as supplied part shortages. In the fourth quarter we expect working capital changes to be positive. During the quarter debt repayments and pension contributions totaled $600 million. And dividends paid were about $500 million while other items include about $1.1 billion related to the stock buyback program that we completed in the quarter. Slide 20 shows that automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $14.9 billion, $500 million lower than second quarter. We ended the quarter with net cash at $7.9 billion and automotive liquidity of $33.6 billion. Earlier this week, we gave notice the holders of our 2016 convertible notes, determine a conversion rights and redeem outstanding notes. This action will reduce automotive debt by about $800 million in the fourth quarter with no significant impact on cash flow. So this concludes our review of the financial details of our third quarter earnings. So now I\u2019d like to turn it back to Mark, who will take us through our outlook for the business environment, as well as our 2014 planning assumptions and key metrics. Mark? Mark Fields : Thanks, Bob. Slide 21 summarizes our view of the business environment for 2014. We project global economic growth to be in the 2.5% range, with conditions in Europe and South America particular concern. Global industry sales are expected to be about 87 million units. U.S. economic indicators and industry sales have remained steady through the third quarter, consistent with economic growth in the 3% range. In South America, Brazil is in recession with election related policy uncertainty. Negative growth also is expected in Argentina and Venezuela with ongoing policy and exchange risk. In Europe, incoming data has weakened, with Euro area GDP growth projected to be less than 1% this year. Conditions in the U.K. however are more favorable with growth projected in the 3% range. Although not shown, the outlook for Russia is challenging and fluid, with very slow GDP growth, inflationary pressures and a weaker currency. In Asia Pacific, China\u2019s economic growth [Technical Difficulty] range with the ongoing property market weakness reflected in our outlook for 2014. Consumer sentiment supports continued growth in vehicle sales but at a more modest pace in the second half. With initial signs of improvement, growth in India is now projected to be in the 5% to 5.5% range. Challenges remain however with high inflation and interest rates as elements [ph] to stronger growth. Overall, despite challenges in some key markets, we expect the global economy to grow in 2014 and be supportive of a projection for higher global industry volume this year. Slide 22 recaps the guidance disclosed earlier for our business unit, as well as for automotive net interest expense. Full year guidance is unchanged for all business units and consistent with their Investor Day outlook. Our company guidance for 2014 is detailed on Slide 23. We now expect full year industry volume of about 16.8 million units in the U.S., about 14.5 million units in the Europe 20 markets, and about 23.8 million units in China. In terms of our financial performance, we continue to expect automotive revenue to be about equal to 2013, automotive operating margin to be lower than 2013. Automotive operating related cash flow to be lower than 2013, including capital spending of about $7.5 billion. Ford Credit pre-tax profit of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion and company pre-tax profit of about $6 billion. 2014 is a critical next step in implementing our ONE Ford plan to deliver profitable growth for all, including strong growth and much improved financial results in 2015 and beyond. As we communicated at our Investor Day event, we expect 2015 company pre-tax profit to be in the $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion range. In closing, our ONE Ford plan is built on compelling vision, comprehensive strategy, and relentless implementation, all leading to profitable growth around the world. We are confident in the continued success of our ONE Ford plan, and in fact are accelerating our pace of progress. The third quarter was challenging but we remain absolutely focused on implementing our plan as we work towards the end of the year, and this includes continued strength from North America, although down from recent years as we launched three times the number of products as last year; a loss in South America, as we respond to a changed environment and continued risk in the region; continued execution of our transformation plan for Europe, even as we work through challenges, primarily in Russia; establishing our Middle East and Africa business unit; continued strong growth and profitability in Asia Pacific; consistent solid performance from our Ford Credit operations, and positive automotive operating related cash flow. So now let\u2019s open it up to your questions. So, George you want to lead us through that? George Sharp : Thanks, Mark. Now we\u2019ll open the lines for about a 45 minute Q&A session. We\u2019ll begin with questions from the investment community and then we\u2019ll take questions from the media. Now as always, in order to allow for as many participants as possible within this timeframe, please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two. Glenn, can we have the first question. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed. Colin Langan \u2013 UBS: Thanks for taking my question. One of the big concerns coming out of Investor Day was the profitability of the new F-150. And I was just wondering how we should be thinking about that because you seemed reluctant to be very committed about how profitable it will be but you also said it has [indiscernible] to customers yet. I mean should we be concerned about the content of being added or is the uncertainty really reflecting that it hasn\u2019t been delivered to customers so you don\u2019t have a good gauge of what the eventual pricing on the product is going to be? Bob Shanks : Hey Colin, thank you very much for the question, obviously an area that continues to be on the mind of investors. We\u2019re not going to get into specific margins of profitability any particular vehicle line but everyone knows how profitable the F-150 is to the company and for the company, and we expect that to continue going forward. When we think about next year and the guidance that we gave for North America, the 8% to 9% [ph] and that triggered a lot of the questions. We need to remind ourselves that we don\u2019t get the both plants, Dearborn and Kansas City up and running until we get into the second quarter. So clearly, that impact has an effect on what we\u2019re seeing for the margins of the whole business unit. If I go back and look at the present generation of the F-150, we saw margins improve over the course of that product cycle life. Must wait and see what happens with the new one, but we\u2019ve got lots of things planned on F-150 once you\u2019re going to see when we come out, I think that will be very exciting, consumers are going to respond positively to that. And we expect it to be a huge success for us and to contribute very significantly to the bottom line. So it\u2019s all I want to say on that. It\u2019s a great product and it\u2019s going to be very good for the business and we think even better as we go through the business planning period. Colin Langan \u2013 UBS: Okay. And I guess my second question, there was an article in the journal earlier this week talking about some potential issues that some of the [Technical Difficulty]. Can you give an update on how the launch is progressing if there is any sort of headwinds that are arising? Mark Fields : Thanks, Colin. This is Mark. As you know, launches are a complex thing but we are absolutely on plan with the launch and it\u2019s progressing well. As you know, we\u2019ve had eight weeks of downtime for the changeover at our Dearborn Truck Plant that was completed. We now have started mass production and we are exactly where we expected to be at this point. The plant is up and running and I was actually down at the plant earlier this week, our employees, they are all trained, they are excited, they are energized. And we\u2019re confident that all of the preparations that have positioned us for a quality launch, and positioned just to had vehicles and dealerships with initial sales by the end of this year as we planned. Colin Langan \u2013 UBS: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you very much. Mark Fields : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Galves with Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Daniel Galves \u2013 Credit Suisse : Good morning. In the U.S. it looks to us like pricing on pickup trucks continues to be very strong and pricing on the car side or the super segments is a little bit weaker, is that your read of the situation as well, and is there any way you can give us some broad strokes on what drove the positive year-over-year pricing in North America by segment? Mark Fields : I\u2019ll take that first part of that Daniel. Yes, I would characterize it as you mentioned, when you look at the truck and SUV side of the business, the pricing has been good. In our own case, even with the \u2013 lets choose F-150 as an example, our outgoing F-150, our transaction prices are up, our incentives levels are below and well below some of our competitors. When you look at the car side, if you look at what\u2019s happened with the segment shift, consumer preferences, they are moving more towards utility, and that is putting pressure on the car side of the business and I think you\u2019re seeing a number of competitors who have capacity there, getting more aggressive in the marketplace. And in our case, we\u2019re going to be balanced as we look at the marketplace in terms of the value and the incentives that we provide to our customers. I would characterize it as you mentioned it. Bob, you want to answer the second part? Bob Shanks : Yes, when you look at \u2013 and I\u2019m on Slide 10 Daniel, but when you look at North America\u2019s pricing and just the pricing element, that\u2019s really near $40 million. The majority of that was actually on carryover vehicles, we did have some good news on some of the products we launched in the first half, it was mostly on carryover and it\u2019s a line-up with Mark \u2013 with Mark said, that was more than explained by positive pricing on trucks and utilities, we actually had negative pricing on cars. So I conclude consistent with the scenario that we outlined. Daniel Galves \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay, got it. And then just a follow up, do you expect those trends to continue, how does the pricing on trucks kind of manifest as the present F-150 and the new F-150 start to kind of be at dealer at the same time? And then on the daily rental side, can you tell us what part of the market share decline was due to daily rental and why are you deciding to decrease daily rental sales at this time? Mark Fields : In the first part of your question, yes, we expect the trends as we see the pricing this year, to flow into next year, and that\u2019s part of the reason as we\u2019ve guided to North America as 8% to 9% margins next year and we \u2013 our view is we\u2019re going to continue to see a lot of competitiveness on the car side of the business, particularly with some of our competitors having some artificial advantages around currency and things of that nature. When you look at \u2013 even with regards to that, our whole strategy around investing in product excellence, we have a number of very strong products coming out on the car side as we get into next year, particular focus, the best-selling car in the world, our new one is coming, it will be in showrooms in the first part of next year. On daily rental, as you\u2019ve seen a part of \u2013 when you look at the eight-tenths of market share deterioration in the quarter, half of that was due to \u2013 or four-tenths was due to the fact that we have throttled back on our sales to daily rental. And part of it is because it\u2019s important that we\u2019re in that market so consumers get experience with our products, but the margins are lower and you know our whole strategy of managing or maximizing our operating margins and profitability but we\u2019ll continue to take a very balanced approach as we look at daily rental. In the quarter, our daily rental sales were down about 32%, they only represented about 5% of our total sales, and that\u2019s down from about 7.5% the year earlier. So that\u2019s the balanced approach we\u2019re taking on this. Daniel Galves \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay, thanks very much. Mark Fields : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Mark Fields : Good morning, John. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a first question on appendix, Slide 12 where you have your 2015 guidance reiterated. As we think about that there is a long way to go to get through 2015, are you considering any major actions or what are the levers that you can pull to potentially influence this to the upside, to put up maybe better numbers than when you\u2019re looking at here? Mark Fields : John I think we\u2019ve been a little ahead of ourselves here. We\u2019re still sitting very comfortably at the $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion, we still have a lot of work to do to put that plan together for 2015, and we will be talking to you about that in more detail in January but I wouldn\u2019t go beyond that at this point. I will just focus today on [Technical Difficulty]. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, second question, you highlighted supplier part shortages in North America as a pressure on volume. I\u2019m just wondering is that something that\u2019s occurring in a short term or do you think there are some real capacity constraints in the supply base that might hamper volumes going forward? Mark Fields : While we\u2019ve seen, we viewed it as short term in nature and obviously in some of the instances what we did to accommodate some of the suppliers that had some issues, we actually pulled forward some down weeks to allow couple of those suppliers to actually catch up. So we feel we\u2019ll be able to make up some of that production in the fourth quarter. As we go forward, we\u2019re going to continue to stay close with our supplier partners, it is a fact that the supplier community is running at or near full capacity, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to continue to work together with our purchasing team and our suppliers to make sure that we keep the plants running. But for this quarter we thought there were some unique issues that we\u2019ve dealt with and have now resolved. John Murphy \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Mark Fields : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnston with Barclays. Please proceed. Brian Johnston \u2013 Barclays: Thank you. I have some questions Mark about the planning assumption that you probably have that \u2013 you got instruct [ph] which is where do you expect the price of gas to be say next year and then over the long term? What kind of assumptions around gas prices have gone so far into your product planning? And you mentioned this vis-\u00e0-vis Europe but I\u2019m wondering supplies to North America, with gas prices where they are, are you going to be able to recover some of the regulatory caf\u00e9 content costs? Mark Fields : Thanks, Brian. Our view on gas prices, obviously what we\u2019re seeing is that the supply fundamental, or the supply growth fundamentals have outpaced the demand growth and we\u2019re seeing obviously the price of a barrel of oil actually go down. Our view continues to be that overtime the price of fuel will continue to rise, probably less so than we did in last year\u2019s business plan but nonetheless, still it\u2019s a non-renewable source and that\u2019s going to play a factor in there. Plus we also have to keep in mind that where we are in terms of the global economic situation right now and a number of the markets around the world, it\u2019s going to through some troubles right now and that\u2019s waning on the growth for the demand for oil. Our view is it will continue to go up, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to continue to stay focused on our product strategy; we\u2019re offering the very best fuel economy for our customers. And then when you think about the \u2013 your comment around the regulatory requirements about improved fuel economy, clearly in Europe we have seen some instances where you can price for that regulation that goes in, here in the U.S. our experience has been it\u2019s very tough to do that and that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to stay very focused on what I would call the physical requirements of delivering those regulations at the most competitive cost. Brian Johnston \u2013 Barclays: Okay. Would it be \u2013 do you think your ability to price if we were at $5, $6 a gallon, in the U.S. would be better and is that and they are all aware you\u2019re in on your 8% to 10% margin range? Mark Fields : Yes, if you\u2019re dealing with $5 to $6 a gallon of oil, yes, I think the dynamics change very greatly in what you comprise. Brian Johnston \u2013 Barclays: Okay, thanks. Mark Fields : Thanks, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Good morning, everybody. Mark Fields : Good morning, Rod. Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Couple of things, one is in the past you\u2019ve given us some data on material X commodities for North America, so hoping you can just provide that again. Our commodities such as aluminum kind of locked in on a longer term basis. Mark Fields : Actually the biggest issue that we had in terms of high prices in the quarter was in South America because that\u2019s priced in dollars and with the weakening currencies that\u2019s been the biggest issue. In the quarter in North America we had about $115 million of higher cost associated with commodity prices and for the total company it was actually about $190 million to $200 million but again a lot of that in South America as well. So in terms of what we\u2019ve got locked in, I think it will probably now be the contracts or hedges, about 85% of our full year commitments are locked in. Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then in South America extra balance sheet adjustments, you did like $60 million loss in the quarter, I know you guided to \u2013 in your Analyst Day a substantial loss but improved. For 2015 doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re looking for a lot of improvement versus the run rate right now. I was hoping you can elaborate on that. And also another clarification on your comment in the Analyst Day, there was a pie chart in your deck where you talked about calls on capital from 2014 to 2020. Debt and pensions was part of that, and if you look at your maturity schedule, pension contributions it looks like there is maybe $13 billion associated with that in 2020. And then next to that there was a sliver of the pie chart, looked like it was roughly two times the debt and pension which was shareholder actions. Is that a right way to kind of size that up, like roughly $13 billion for debt and pension and maybe $26 billion for shareholder actions as part of your plan? Mark Fields : [Technical Difficulty]. As we look at the run rate in fourth quarter, clearly as part of our plan is to introduce our ONE Ford product so we do expect some top line growth particularly around the new Ka or car that we\u2019re introducing it to the marketplace. This segment is the biggest segment in Brazil, the product is off to a great start, we just launched it last month. We do expect to get some price recovery from inflation, we actually saw more of that in third quarter, in places like Brazil than we saw previously. We\u2019re going to continue to work on our structural cost as we go forward. So as we stand back and we look at South America for next year, we do accept some level of economic and industry growth but also the launch of the global products tailored to that market will help. Bob Shanks : Yes, and in terms of your question on the pie chart \u2013 Rod, what we did say at the event is that in terms of pensions for 2015 and 2016 we\u2019re expecting contributions of about $1.5 billion here to our funded plans and that would get us to the plant where we believe, any aggregate might be different plan-by-plan but we would be fully funded. And then thereafter about $0.5 billion or so just for ongoing service cost and so forth. In terms of the debt, automotive debt, we said that by 2018 we\u2019ll be down to about $10 billion and that assumption assumes actually that we continue to pay that down a bit as things mature, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s where we\u2019ll end up, Neil is actually looking at what\u2019s the appropriate size of debt for the size of the company that we expect to be at that point in time but that is less than those numbers. And then the balance as you rightly said is much greater amount of capital allocated to shareholder distributions and what we\u2019ve said in the previous five years. I wouldn\u2019t put a number against that because it is further out and things can change, plus or minus, but based on our present assumptions that is certainly what we have in mind. Rod Lache \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs : The response went [ph] same time the Latin America question I think that Rod had asked. One follow up is, I just wanted a better understanding of what that balance sheet item was that was I think $109 million. Is that just kind of ongoing currency re-measurement or was that sort of a discrete item, similar to what happened in Venezuela in the first quarter just because that seems fairly lumpy and large. Bob Shanks : Yes, it\u2019s actually very similar to what we saw in the first quarter except it wasn\u2019t of the same magnitude, and in fact, the thing it\u2019s interesting and you\u2019re seeing that, and many earnings reports in this period is the effect of the stronger dollar on a lot of various companies and surely that\u2019s what we saw. But just to give you a feel for what happened, we had a 62% devaluation and \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, 48% devaluation in the bolivar, 32% devaluation in the peso, about 8% in the Brazilian real. And it will threaten net assets, the value of those assets now in dollars given that the change in the currencies gave us the $109 million effect that we talked about. That is \u2013 as Mark said in his comments that\u2019s part of what we expect to see happening next year, currencies continuing to weaken, and then it will be one of the challenges that we face in South America as we \u2013 you will have the positive effects you talked about but you will continue to have high inflation, there is no sign that\u2019s going to go away, and you will have these depreciating currencies. Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs : And then, I guess your guidance for South America that you gave at the Analyst Day for next year, that did kind of contemplate like a further, sort of onetime sizeable re-measurement impact for the bolivar, that\u2019s correct, right? Bob Shanks : It reflected \u2013 I guess I\u2019d say differently, it didn\u2019t assume some massive deval [ph], and clearly that\u2019s something I think we all have to keep an eye on because with what\u2019s happening to the U.S. dollar and the impact \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the oil rather, and what that could mean to the Venezuelan economy and their ability to differ what seems inevitable in terms of massive deval, that\u2019s something we have to watch. We have not assumed that for next year, perhaps we\u2019ve assumed just the continued weakening of currencies but if there were a significant onetime deval by the government that would certainly chang the equation in terms of what the impact would be. Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, understood. And then my second question just on Asia, you guys did for one pretty clearly that the cadence in the first half would be lower than the second half, would not be carried forward because lot of those cost items. As a little bit sort of \u2013 those items were larger than I think some of us had modelled and just wanted to better get a sense of what the timeframe was for some of those \u2013 you have the launch of Lincoln, you have all these plants that are launching concurrently as you\u2019re adding capacity to end of the year. How should we think about the timeframe on which that elevated expense plays out? Bob Shanks : I guess a general comment and maybe more specific on the quarter, in general if you go back to Investor Day and I think Dave Shak [ph] had a slide that showed capacity over the next five years and I think we\u2019ve got [Technical Difficulty] and then we show one bar that had greater than 2.7 that was undefined because we \u2013 as long as we continue to grow and we expect to do that we\u2019ll have to put in place capacity above in the arm that\u2019s even coming in right now. So I hope that happens, I hope we have to continue to invest in growth in the business because that would just be good for the business. What we\u2019ve thought going on the quarter that we\u2019ve got the five facilities that are under construction, I think all of them either have a full complement of the hourly workers for example in place, or at least nearly in the process of being trained. So we\u2019re carrying that cost, we\u2019ve begun some depreciation and amortization as everything is being capitalized but some of it has the building to have progressed. And then in addition to those, we\u2019re adding a shift, we just added a shift at our plant in Thailand, there is another shift it\u2019s coming on this month in Chennai [ph], and because our capacity increase that we\u2019re planning at the end of this nine month period, actually one of our engine plants in China, so not all new facilities that certainly continue spending for capacity increases, and that\u2019s a play here as well. You mentioned Lincoln but that we\u2019ve been incurring those cost now for some quarters and continue to do so this quarter. And to put it on the context, if you take the $173 million that you can see there which almost all of it is structural cost. So 40% of that relates to what I just described, the Lincoln cost, as well as the cost associated with these plan. Mark Fields : And just to add to put a perspective, the context of growth, we got a few questions on our September sales which were down two-tenths of percentage point in China and we have some questions around that. Just to put it into perspective, the September sales were \u2013 they were strong, they were steady, after a very strong comparison with 2013 and as Bob mentioned earlier, we had a record share in China in the quarter of 4.7%, and year-to-date our sales are up 26% versus an industry that\u2019s up somewhere around 8%. So as you look at the remainder of this year we expect to be a bit down in the month of October but you will start seeing it grow again. I would think of it as it\u2019s not a pause in our sales growth, it\u2019s more of a pit stop as we position ourselves for growth based on the points that Bob mentioned that are going to be coming online next year. Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, understood. I mean it\u2019s a high class problem to have those kinds of growth opportunity. But I guess it does sound like fixed cost is at least for the balance next year, I mean you guys have given some color already but it sounds like it will continue at this pace of addition, at least for the next five quarters or so? Mark Fields : Yes, and that\u2019s the only other thing I would add and I\u2019ve said it before, I would expect it to be lumpy, it\u2019s not going to be linear. At some quarter it will have more impact than others. Patrick Archambault \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, great. Thanks a lot for the color guys. Mark Fields : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thanks, everybody, just two questions, first for Bob. Bob, General Motors showed a chart on their Investor Day saying that they are breakeven in the U.S. and a fixed market share was around 10 million or 11 million units. I\u2019m wondering if you made a similar calculation and whether you kind of confirm a similar order magnitude breakeven SAAR? Bob Shanks : Yes, same order magnitude. Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. Now in that analysis can I ask what you\u2019ve assumed for price down or is that fixed too? Bob Shanks : I don\u2019t understand the question. Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Meaning when you won a simulation of going to 11 million U.S. SAAR, do you keep pricing at today\u2019s levels or do you cross pricing? Bob Shanks : We change a number of factors, the pricing is not one of them. Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. Bob Shanks : In that case one of the things that was interesting I think when we saw the downturn and 8 or 9 months [ph] we saw the pricing go up. Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Right. Okay, Mark, next question for you. If you wanted \u2013 and this is a question about competitors product and I\u2019m sure \u2013 and we know that you guys have tested and torn apart and I would imagine you guys have all driven the Tesla Model S. I\u2019m just curious in your opinion, high level, if you wanted to Tesla Model S, in your opinion this Ford Motor Company have the engineering, resources, take and talent, particularly software talent to do that? Mark Fields : To your question, yes, we have. We have driven the Model S, we have torn it down, we\u2019ve put it back together, we drove it again, we\u2019re very familiar with that product. And I think our product development team is very familiar with the approach they have taken. When we think about our products going forward, we have obviously a lot of experience as you know from a number of our electrified power trains and electrified vehicles that we have in the marketplace. And the answer is yes, I do believe with talent we have to continue to add and compliment that talent, absolutely. And part of that is the growth we\u2019re going to see in our Silicon Valley operations which is going to be growing significantly so that we can attract that talent to our company and compliment the already strong talent we have in those areas. Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley : So then just as you are not there, you can\u2019t do it but you \u2013 is it intentioned to do something like that or is that just so niche that you want to focus on the more mainstream stuff for now and that kind of go forward strategy? Mark Fields : I think it\u2019s very consistent with our product strategy, you know one of our fillers in our product strategy is from a technology standard, to have some more technology in our vehicles and you guys have seen them in a lot of the technology we have, we\u2019re going to build on that, we\u2019re going to make sure we have the talent to deliver it. Adam Jonas \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Definitely, thanks gentlemen. Mark Fields : Thanks, Adam. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow up, a little bit on some of \u2013 I guess the question in the topic, one that Patrick brought up earlier with Asia Pacific, and then I guess specifically in the fourth quarter when you\u2019re sticking to about 700 for the year, you\u2019ve done about 500 this year, and it sounds like given the commentary you organized some more plans and you would expect there would be some continued headwinds. So I ask could you just give a little bit of color so what the offset is there that still would show a meaningful year-over-year gain. Bob Shanks : Yes, we expect to have payable volume mix in the quarter. Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : And that\u2019s from new product? Bob Shanks : Actually it\u2019s a new product but it\u2019s also \u2013 as we\u2019ve said in the text [ph] that we\u2019re going to earlier, we\u2019re just continue to see strength across the entire line-up. So we expect that to continue in the quarter Joseph. Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And then, sorry if I have missed this, but the working capital drag in the third quarter was that mostly timing related? Should we expect that to reverse in fourth quarter? Bob Shanks : Yes, we expect to have positive cash flow in the fourth \u2013 positive cash flow but positive working capital in the quarter and we do expect this to reverse. This is really the impact of the launch effects as well as the supplier shortage that Mark talked about earlier. So we expect that to reverse out in the first quarter. Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Completely or\u2026 Bob Shanks : Largely. Joseph Spak \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Largely, okay. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one for Neil, I know that you provide some sensitivity in your 10-K impact of discount rates on the funded status of the pension plans on the PBO and the asset side. I was curious you\u2019ve given the recent decline in rates, whether you\u2019ve made any preliminary estimates of potential impact on yearend status, whether that\u2019s if you could share with us today? And then a related one [ph] maybe for Bob, could you comment on whether changes in interest rates are actuarial assumptions would be material enough to have any impact on your capital allocation strategy which I think calls for cycling pass pension contributions to make more room for return of capital to shareholders? Bob Shanks : Thanks, Ryan. I think from the standpoint of our de-risking strategy, the reduction in rates has been almost completely offset by returns. And so we\u2019re about 1 percentage point change in funding status since our year end position, so that\u2019s about $1 billion worse than we were at the end of 2013. Neil Schloss : Yes, the only thing I would add to that Ryan is to me firstly the analysis that you did was actually very good and it was consistent with what we provided and the sensitivity that\u2019s we have seen better performance in terms of assets and so forth, and of course our contributions. But to me the thing that\u2019s really encouraging about what we\u2019re seeing with the big change of interest rates and particularly given the fact that in Germany where that\u2019s our most underfunded funding plan, we\u2019ve seen an incredibly big change in the discount rates that were still about $1 billion or so [ph] where we were at the end of last year. It just shows that the strategy is working and I just wonder if we\u2019re getting the full recognition of that from investors because the volatility that we would have had if you go back four five years ago compared to what we are today is much, much improved which was the whole plan of the strategy in the first place. Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan: Great, thanks, very helpful update. And then, just \u2013 my last question. I think the 2Q call you\u2019re looking forward to, the EPA release that\u2019s mileage rating for the F-150 potentially within weeks. And would you have expected it by now particularly given that the vehicle will be gone on sale pretty soon. What might be holding that up? I know you\u2019ve said it will be the most efficient truck but is there anything more you\u2019re able to share with us today about just a magnitude of expected improvement? Thanks. Mark Fields : We expect and we\u2019ve always expected the EPA labels to come probably sometime in the latter half of November. So there is no surprise for us there and we should have that then. Ryan Brinkman \u2013 JPMorgan: Okay, looking forward to it. Thanks. Mark Fields : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Galliers with ISI Group. Please proceed. George Galliers \u2013 ISI Group : Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I had two questions. Firstly, as you highlighted the next [ph] margin, X warranty was still at a very high level despite the model changeover is going on and other cost running negative $170 million during the quarter. I was wondering if you could give some guidance on the cost cadence in terms of later stage engineering launch, any associative with the F-150 overcoming quarters, and to what extent you can quantify that? Then also just on China, you said that you expected sales to maybe be flat to down over coming months due to capacity constraints. At what point based on your planning assumptions for Chinese end market and your gains, do you see yourselves being able to supply to actually match demand or exceed demand in China? Under what point is that prices middle part of next year or is it later than that? Mark Fields : Okay, why don\u2019t we take that first part of the question \u2013 as we mentioned we\u2019ll probably see our sales a bit down in the month of October, I think you will start seeing some small growth in November and I think you will start seeing some decent growth as we introduce [Technical Difficulty] next year. As we get into the latter half of next year I think we\u2019ll \u2013 as we bring on these plants with even more new products you will see an accelerated pace. Bob Shanks : Okay. And then in terms of \u2013 George, your question about structural cost, and I think that was on North America, is that correct? George Galliers \u2013 ISI Group : Yes, exactly. Bob Shanks : As the case, it was actually a pretty light quarter for us in terms of structural cost, I would expect it to be much more of a stature in the fourth quarter and that is in parts we know we always have higher structural cost in the fourth quarter and part of that\u2019s related to what happened later in overhead inventory given the fact that we\u2019ve got production \u2013 the plant is down at the end of the year, so the cost \u2013 right cost come out of the balance sheet go into the income statement, so that would be a factor. But also we\u2019ve got all the launches ahead of it that we\u2019ve yet to complete. That usually brings with it higher advertising and sales promotion expenses research and market the products, and of course the depreciation and amortization we talked about. And then the other thing is that we\u2019re continuing to invest in terms of engineering in particular for products yet to come. We talked about all the launches we have next year, so we\u2019ll include that expense as well. So I would expect to see a much larger number on a year-over-year basis in the quarter and an increase quarter-to-quarter. George Galliers \u2013 ISI Group : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Weston [ph] with Morningstar. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Two questions, one on South America, one on Russia. In South America, I guess I\u2019m just a little surprised if we see that the against [ph] Q4 is roughly breakeven to a small loss, are you expecting the market to bottom up there in fourth quarter? Are you cutting cost to get to that number or is it all a pricing inflation tailwind? Bob Shanks : It\u2019s driven by the effect of the new car that we\u2019ve just introduced, really very partially benefited from that in the third quarter but we are approaching full production of both photo and the client door sales, we think that will be the big driver of the results in the quarter. Mark Fields : In addition to also the new X Series we\u2019ve introduced back into the marketplace after a bit of a high AS, that will help us well. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thank you. And then in Russia, obviously with a very weak market there, are you seeing lot of your rational pricing from competitors and is the Sollers JV holding the line on pricing are also buying share? Mark Fields : Overall we\u2019re seeing some very aggressive pricing, particularly from some of our Japanese competitors as they take advantage of their currency \u2013 it\u2019s Russia \u2013 their competitiveness. So we are seeing \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re seeing hugely irrational but overall with the market being down, it\u2019s getting very competitive. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Mark Fields : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey with The Wall Street Journal. Please proceed. Mike Ramsey \u2013 The Wall Street Journal : Good morning. I wanted to ask an overall question that related to how is the auto market doing globally. Mark, I think you mentioned that the worldwide economies are struggling a little bit but can you kind of give me a look at, maybe in the next year a little bit. Are we in kind of a soft patch globally or do you \u2013 and are you forecasting or getting a little more concerned that we might be heading into a more dangerous period or not? Mark Fields : Well there is a lot of things going in the world but you\u2019re seeing our \u2013 in Investor Day, our view of growth over the business plan period and we expect this to be in our \u2013 we expect this to be a growth industry and we\u2019re a growth company in that growth industry. As we look at some of the various markets, you\u2019ve seen our guidance for next year and the industry here in the U.S. which is up from what our expectations are for this year. In Europe we expect very moderate growth but a little bit of growth there, same thing in China, and of course down in South America, that\u2019s probably the softest patches we see with a lot of the uncertainties that we\u2019ve talked about before. But overall standing back, putting in context where we are, it\u2019s a growth industry and we\u2019re a growth business within that industry. Mike Ramsey \u2013 The Wall Street Journal : Okay, great. Thanks. Mark Fields : Thank you. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And your next question comes from the line of Phil Udau [ph] with DNDC. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, Mark. Mark Fields : Hey Phil, how are you doing? Unidentified Analyst : Good. Quick question for you, the pricing strength that you\u2019re noticing with SUVs and with the F Series, you\u2019ve been in this industry a long time, relative to when you\u2019ve seen pricing power like this in the past, how does this stack up right now in terms of what you\u2019re seeing, in terms of the demand that\u2019s out there for SUVs and your ability to drive pricing? Mark Fields : I think there are a couple of things. One is, when you look at just a fundamental demand, you look at the age of the park and it\u2019s \u2013 what\u2019s the right term, it\u2019s quite mature by our view back in the 2005 timeframe, probably about high 30s, 40% of the products out there, cars, utilities and trucks were ten year\u2019s older, we think that\u2019s more like about 50% now and probably even skewed even higher on pickup trucks. So from a demand standpoint I think the replacement demand versus periods in the past is quite [Technical Difficulty] marry that against the production capacity that\u2019s out there in the industry. Many folks including ourselves are running a very high capacities I think, when you look at those two elements I think it bodes well for pricing in those segments that will remain pretty good and then probably the last piece of it is just the new products that are coming into the marketplace, and in particular are new products. I think we\u2019re heading into a good pricing environment where our new expedition, our new navigator, our new MKC will allow us to take advantage of a very good situation going forward. And that helps putting to context our guidance for next year. Unidentified Analyst : Fantastic, thank you. Mark Fields : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brad Reynold [ph] with Automotive News. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, my question is just related to the gross automotive cash figure which I have, $22.8 billion in Q3, that\u2019s quite a steep drop from second quarter. And maybe you gave some of this but what were the components that drove that drop you could clarify again? Mark Fields : Yes, Brad we\u2019re happy to help you. $1.1 billion of that was the conclusion of our share buyback program that we announced back in May, so that was the largest single piece. We had $0.5 billion of dividends, $300 million of pension contributions, our debt came down by $300 million and then of course we have the negative operating cash flow that we talked about earlier in the call which was driven largely by the negative change in working capital. So that\u2019s the $3 billion. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Oliver [ph] with Detroit Free Press. Please proceed. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning gentlemen. Mark, you have been very personally involved in all of these launches because you have so many, and I\u2019m just wondering the problem with some of the part shortages, could you give us some contacts as to whether that would have happened either way or has your planning, could it have been a lot worse if you hadn\u2019t had all of this extra planning or \u2013 give us a sense of how this fits in with your strategy. Mark Fields : Just to clarify, the production or the part shortages that we have experienced actually were on current products, none on our new launches. So as I said our new launches are going according to plan and with the existing production, that\u2019s been really some of the issues that we\u2019ve had, we\u2019ve been able to resolve those issues, we\u2019ll be able to make some of that production up as we mentioned earlier in the quarter, not all of it but it\u2019s been on existing models, not the new launches. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then so do you feel that the extra planning you\u2019ve done then has avoided this kind of thing happening as you launch? Mark Fields : Well we\u2019re staying very close with our supplier partners as we launch all these new products, and we\u2019ll continue to do so to make sure that we have successful launches. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Mark Fields : Thanks, Elisa [ph]. Operator : At this time ladies and gentlemen I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. George Sharp for closing remarks. George Sharp : Thank you, Glenn and thanks everybody out there. That wraps up today\u2019s presentation. We are really glad you were able to join us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

And welcome to the Ford Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chantelle, and I will be your facilitator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. George Sharp, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir. George Sharp : Thank you, Chantelle, and good morning. Welcome to everyone joining us today either by phone or by webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I\u2019d like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning so that we can provide you with additional details of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results. Presenting today are Mark Fields, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, our Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO. Now copies of this morning\u2019s press release and the presentation slides are available on Ford\u2019s Investor and Media websites. The financial results discussed today are preliminary and include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Any non-GAAP measure are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck, and final data will be included in our Form 10-K. Finally, today\u2019s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford\u2019s future performance, of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect actual results are summarized at the end of this presentation and of course, are detailed in our SEC filings. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the presentation over to Mark. Mark Fields : Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Today we are going to review our fourth quarter and our full year 2014 financial results, and we\u2019ll also update our view of the business environment for 2015 and also our guidance for the year ahead. So let\u2019s get right into the first slide. Our results this quarter and for the full year reflect our continued focus on our One Ford plan, which remains unchanged. Our plan is served as well and we\u2019ll continue to do so going forward. And we are now building on our success by accelerating the pace of progress throughout our business. We are starting to see the full benefits and strength of One Ford, and we intend to maximize these opportunities going forward. And here at Ford, we are passionate about product excellence and leading in innovation. And we are absolutely committed to building on our product strength today, we have even more new products and innovations that will deliver growth for our stakeholders and define our company going forward. So now let\u2019s turn to slide two for a look at the fourth quarter and the full year. The fourth quarter was our 22nd consecutive profitable quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was positive and liquidity remained strong. Fourth quarter wholesale volume and company revenue were lower than a year ago by 2% and 5%, respectively. Looking at the business units, North America and Asia-Pacific were profitable, and Ford Credit once again delivered strong results. For the full year, the company delivered its fifth consecutive year of pre-tax profit and positive automotive operating related cash flow, and the results were consistent with guidance. North America was profitable and we achieved a record profit in Asia-Pacific. Ford Credit profit was its highest since 2011 and while we reported losses in other business units, Europe and Middle East and Africa improved from a year ago. Volume was about equal to a year ago, while company revenue declined 2% and we achieved record market share in Asia-Pacific driven by record share in China. Our global pension plans were under funded by $9 billion at the end of 2014, which was unchanged from 2013 despite significantly lower discount rates. For 2015, our company outlook for pre-tax profit, automotive revenue and operating margin is unchanged from our September Investor Day guidance and we expect company pre-tax profit to range from $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion, with automotive revenue and automotive operating margin higher than 2014, which is largely driven by our new products and capacity. And today we are improving our outlook for automotive operating related cash flow from positive to higher than 2014. And before getting into the financial details, I\u2019d like to take you through some of our other achievements in 2014, which if you\u2019ll see on slide three. We watched 24 all-new or significantly refreshed products globally last year. This included the all-new F-150, which was awarded the Truck of Texas and named the North American International Auto Show Truck of the Year earlier this month, and deliveries and sales began in December. The launch is also included the all-new 50th anniversary Mustang, Escort, Ka, Transit and Lincoln MKC. Our best-selling midsize SUV the Ford Explorer debuted its new look at the LA Auto Show and will be available for customers in markets around the world later this year. We also revealed the all-new Ford Everest in Asia-Pacific. Ford remained the best-selling vehicle brand in the U.S. and the best-selling automaker in Canada for the fifth year in a row. And this was supported by continued strong sales of F Series, which despite the downtime on F-150 to support the new vehicle launch achieved U.S. truck sales leadership for the 38th straight year and U.S. vehicle sales leadership for 33rd year in a row. We also set U.S. sales records for Fusion and Escape. In Europe, we remained the number two vehicle brand, selling vehicle brand and continue to progress our transformation plan, achieving a year-over-year share gain for the Europe 20 market for first time since 2009. We also closed our Genk, Belgium plant improving our capacity utilization. Our growth in China continued with a record $1.1 million wholesales in 2014. In addition, our Changan Ford joint venture opened two new plants and we launched Lincoln in China, with the first nine Lincoln dealerships, which began sales of the Lincoln MKZ and MKC. Consistent with our plan to provide regular and growing dividends that are sustainable over an economic or business cycle, we increased our 2014 quarterly dividend by 25% and as you know, we announced an additional 20% increase earlier this month. We also completed our share repurchase program that reduced our diluted shares by about 3%. So now, I\u2019d like to turn over to Bob, who\u2019ll take us through the financial results. Bob? Bob Shanks : Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s start on the top of slide four, where you\u2019ll see that fourth quarter wholesale volume was 1.6 million units that was down to 30,000 units from a year ago. And revenue was $35.9 billion, that was down $1.7 billion. Pre-tax profit was $1.1 billion, excluding special items. That was $197 million lower than a year ago. After-tax earnings per share at $0.26 were $0.06 lower. Net income attributable to Ford, including pre-tax special item charges, was $52 million. This was $3 billion lower than a year ago, including a non-repeat of a favorable $2.1 billion special tax item that we benefited from last year. Earnings were $0.01 a share and it was down $0.74. Pre-tax special item charges were $1.2 billion in the quarter reflecting primarily one-time loss resulting from a change in how we account for our Venezuela operations as well separation related actions in Europe and Asia Pacific to support our transformation plans and charges associated with the settlement of our 2016 convertible notes. You can find additional detail on the special items in appendix three. Automotive operating-related cash flow was $500 million, and automotive gross cash was $21.7 billion, exceeding debt by $7.9 billion. In the full year, our operating effective tax rate, which isn\u2019t shown, was 35%. For 2015, we expect the rate which excludes the profits of our unconsolidated subsidiaries to be about equal to our 2014 rate assuming extension of U.S. research credit legislation in the fourth quarter. Full year vehicle wholesales were about equal to a year ago, while the company revenue decreased by 2%. Full year pre-tax operating profit, excluding special items, was $6.3 billion and, as Mark said, in line with guidance. The result was a decline of $2.3 billion from a year ago and net income was $3.2 billion, which was $4 billion lower than a year ago. As shown on slide 5, both of our sectors Automotive and Financial Services contributed to the company\u2019s fourth quarter and full year pre-tax profits. Company fourth quarter and full year pre-tax profits were lower than a year ago more than explained by automotive. Compared with third quarter Automotive was favorable, while Financial Services more than explained the $60 million decline in profits. The key market factors in financial metrics for our automotive business in the fourth quarter are shown on slide 6. As you can see on the far left, wholesale volume and revenue declined 2% and 5% from a year ago respectively. The volume decline is more than explained by North America, while the revenue decline reflects all business units. About half of the revenue decline is attributable to unfavorable exchange. Global industry SAAR is estimated at 90.2 million units, that was up 2% from a year ago. Ford\u2019s global market share is estimated at 6.9%, down two-tenths of a percentage point due to North America. Operating margin was 2.8%, down four-tenths of a percentage points from a year ago, while automotive pre-tax profit was $713 million and that was down $250 million. The decline in both metrics is more than explained by North America. As shown in the memo below the chart, full year volume was about equal to a year ago, while automotive revenue was down 3%, more than explained by lower volume from consolidated operations and unfavorable exchange, with the exchange effect accounting for nearly 60% of the decline. Operating margin at 3.9% was down 1.5 percentage points. Total automotive pre-tax profit at $4.5 billion was down $2.4 billion. The lower results were driven by the Americas. All other business units improved. We\u2019ve included full year key metrics and year- over-year variance slides for the automotive sector and each of our business units in the appendix. As shown on slide 7, the $250 million decline in fourth quarter automotive pre-tax profit was driven by higher cost and unfavorable exchange. Higher net pricing in all regions, except Asia Pacific, was a partial offset. And as shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was about equal to third quarter. The absolute fourth quarter pre-tax results for each of our automotive operations as well as other automotive are shown on slide 8. As you can see North America and Asia Pacific were profitable, while the other business units reported losses. On slide 9, we show the factors that contributed to the $2.4 billion decline in total automotive full year pre-tax profit. The decline is more than explained by higher costs, including warranty, unfavorable exchange, and lower volume, including product launch effects and supply part shortages. Higher net pricing was a partial offset. The absolute full year pr\u00eat-tax results for each of our automotive operations as well as the other automotive are shown on slide 10. As you can see North America was profitable and Asia Pacific delivered a record result. Middle East and Africa was about breakeven, while Europe and South America incurred large losses as expected. Now we look at each of the regions within the automotive sector starting on slide 11 with North America. North America fourth quarter wholesale volume and revenue were down 5% to 6% from a year ago. While North America continued to benefit from robust industry sales, our strong product line-up continued discipline in matching production with demand and a lean cost structure, our fourth quarter results were affected adversely by the lower volume. This reflects lower market share and lower dealer stock increases than a year ago, offset partially by higher industry sales, including the US SAAR 17.2 million units, 1.2 million units higher than a year ago. Our U.S. market share deteriorated 1.1 percentage points to 14.3% and that was largely retail related. This primarily reflects a lower F-150 share, as we continue to balance share with transaction prices and stocks during the transition to all new F-150. Shares were also lower for several other products at the end of their product cycles, as we transition to the new products launched either in the fourth quarter of last year or earlier this year. As shown in appendix 8, our U.S. retail market share of the retail industry was 12.8%. This was down nine-tenth of a percentage point from a year ago, mainly reflecting the factors I already cited. The decline in North America\u2019s revenue is explained by the lower volume. North America operating margin was 7.4%, down eight-tenths of a percentage point from last year, and pre-tax profit was $1.5 billion, down $252 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, all full year metrics declined from the year ago. The change in the financial metrics is more than explained by the lower volumes and higher warranty costs, including recalls. Operating margin was 8.4%, which was slightly better than our guidance. On slide 12, we show the factors contributing to North America\u2019s lower fourth quarter pre-tax profit. The decline is more than explained by the impact of new product launches in the quarter on volume and cost. Higher net pricing including for new products and lower warranty costs were partial offsets. As shown in the memo, pre-tax profit was higher than third quarter, more than explained by lower warranty costs and favorable market factors. Higher structural cost, including the effect of new product launches, was a partial offset. Now let\u2019s turn to slide 13 and review South America, where we\u2019re continuing to execute our strategy of expanding our product line-up, including replacing legacy products with global One Ford offerings. We\u2019re also continuing to manage the effects of slowing GDP growth, lower industry volumes in our larger markets, weaker currencies, high inflation, as well as policy uncertainty in some countries. In the fourth quarter wholesale volume and revenue decreased from a year ago by 2% and 9% respectively. The lower volume is more than explained by an 800,000 unit decline from last year\u2019s SAAR of 6.1 million units, reflecting primarily the impact of import restrictions in Argentina, and the weaker economy in Brazil. South America market share at 9.4% was up nine-tenths of a percentage point, reflecting primarily the New Ka, which was awarded the most sought after car of the year award in Brazil from leading magazine, Autoesporte. Focus also contributed to the share improvement. The revenue decline is more than explained by weaker currencies and unfavorable volume and mix with higher net pricing as a partial offset. Operating margin was negative 7.6%. This was down 2.9 percentage points from a year ago and pretax loss was $187 million, a deterioration of $61 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, all full year metrics deteriorated from a year ago driven by unfavorable changes in external factors. The full year loss includes $426 million of adverse balance sheet exchange effects related primarily to the devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar in the first quarter. On slide 14, we show the factors contributing to the decline in South America's fourth quarter pre-tax results. Higher warranty cost including a field service action, more than explained the deterioration compared with both the prior year and third quarter. The adverse effects in the quarter of weaker currencies and high local inflation were nearly offset by higher net pricing. Also note that the share growth from new products offset the industry decline. Let\u2019s now turn to Europe beginning on slide 15 where we continue to implement our transformation plan focused on product, brand and cost. Europe's wholesale volume improved 5% from a year ago, while revenue declined 2%. The higher volume is more than explained by 500,000 unit increase in Europe 20 SAAR to 15.1 million units and a lower dealer stock reduction compared with a year ago. The focus on product and brand saw continued progress in the quarter with launch of the new focus in all-new Mondeo. Our Europe 20 market share improved two-tenths of a percentage point to 7.6%, driven by a 2.8 point improvement in our commercial vehicle share to 11.7% reflecting the success of our full line of new transit vehicles and continued strong performance of the Ranger compact pickup. The decrease in Europe's revenue is more than explained by unfavorable exchange. Europe's operating margin was negative 6.5%, an improvement of 1.1 percentage points from a year ago and pre-tax loss was $443 million, an $86 million improvement. As shown in the memo below the chart, all full year metrics improved from a year ago. Slide 16 shows the factors that contributed to the improvement in Europe's fourth quarter pretax results. The improvement is more than explained by favorable market factors, offset partially by Russia. As shown in the memo below the chart, pretax results were about equal to third quarter despite the impact of Russia. Let\u2019s now turn to slide 17 and review Middle East and Africa where we\u2019re focused on building our distribution capability, expanding our One Ford product offering tailored to the needs of markets in the region and leveraging global low-cost sourcing hubs for vehicles in this fast growing part of the world. Middle East and Africa's wholesale volume and revenue declined 10% and 2%, respectively. The lower volume primarily reflects an unfavorable change in dealer stocks to align with near-term market demand. Operating margin was negative 8.2%, two percentage points better than a year ago and pre-tax loss was $82 million, $22 million better. Higher net pricing and favorable mix more than explained the improvement. As shown in the memo below the chart, full year wholesale volume and revenue declined compared with the year ago, while operating margin and profits improved. Let\u2019s now review Asia Pacific on slide 18. We\u2019re continuing our strategy in Asia Pacific to invest for growth through both new and expanded plants, new products and the introduction of Lincoln in China. As shown on the left, fourth quarter wholesale volume was up 2% compared with a year ago, while net revenue which excludes our China JVs, declined 9%. Our China wholesale volume, which isn't shown was up 5% in the quarter. The higher volume in the region is more than explained by higher industry volume. We estimate fourth quarter SAAR for the region at 40.7 million units that's up 600,000 units from a year ago. Lower market share was a partial offset. Our fourth quarter market share of 3.5% was down one-tenth of a percentage point from a year ago. Our market share in China also deteriorated one-tenth of a percentage to 4.3%. This was due to our wholesale industry that was well above trend. Asia-Pacific\u2019s lower revenue reflects lower volume from consolidated operations and unfavorable exchange. Operating margin was 3.6%, down two-tenths of a percentage point from year ago and pre-tax profit was $95 million, down $14 million. As shown in the memo below the chart, all full year metrics improved from a year earlier and were records. In 2014, our China joint ventures contributed $1.3 billion to pre-tax profit, reflecting our equity share of earnings after tax. Additional detail can be found in the appendix. The balance of results for the region primarily reflected Australia where we\u2019re implementing our transformation plan; India, where we're investing for future growth including the launch of two plants later this year and unfavorable industry and economic factors in ASEAN. On slide 19, we show the factors that contributed to Asia-Pacific\u2019s lower fourth quarter pretax profit. The decline is more than explained by higher warranty cost related to a field service action. As shown in the memo, Asia Pacific pre-tax results improved in the third quarter more than explained by favorable volume and mix. Okay, let\u2019s turn now on slide 20, the Ford credit, our strategic asset and an integral part of our global growth and value-creation strategy. Ford credit provides world-class dealer and customer financial services, supported by strong balance sheet, providing solid profits and distributions to Ford. The Ford credit improved pre-tax profit this quarter compared with year ago as more than explained by higher volume as favorable market valuation adjustments to derivatives included in other. The higher volume reflects increases in consumer finance receivables and operating leases globally as well as non-consumer finance receivables outside of North America. Partial offset of lower margin driven primarily by one-time reserve in Europe and the run-off of higher-yielding assets originated in prior years in North America. As shown in the memo, pretax profit was lower than third quarter, explained primarily by lower margin reflecting Europe reserve. Slide 21 provides an explanation of the change in Ford credit\u2019s full-year pre-tax profit compared with 2013. The improvement is more than explained by higher volume, driven by increases in consumer and non-consumer finance receivables globally, as well as operating leases in North America. Partial offsets include unfavorable lease residual performance in North America resulting from lower relative auction values and lower financing margin. The lower financing margin primarily reflects the Europe reserve previously mentioned and lower portfolio pricing in North America. Next on slide 22 is our automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. Automotive growth cash at the end of the quarter was $21.7 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion from the end of the third quarter. This includes a one-time unfavorable $500 million cash affect associated with the accounting change for operations in Venezuela. Automotive operating related cash flow was positive $500 million more than explained by profits. During the quarter, debt repayments and pension contributions totaled $600 million while dividends paid were about $500 million. Full-year automotive operating related cash flow was $3.6 billion and gross cash declined $3.1 billion. Slide 23 shows that automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $13.8 billion, that was $1.1 billion lower than third quarter including actions taken on our 2016 convertible notes. We ended the quarter with net cash of $7.9 billion and automotive liquidity of $32.4 billion. Slide 24 provides an annual update on our global pension plans. Worldwide pension expense, excluding special items was $1 billion that was $600 million lower than 2013, driven primarily by higher discount rates at year-end \u201813 compared with 2012. In 2014, we made $1.5 billion in cash contributions to our worldwide funded pension plans, down $3.5 million, reflecting our improved funded status. In 2015, cash contributions through our funded plans are expected to be about $1.1 billion globally, most of which are mandatory. Worldwide, our pension plans were underfunded by $9 billion at year end that\u2019s unchanged from year-end 2013, despite significantly lower discount rates, down 80 basis points in the U.S. and about 100 basis points in non-U.S. markets. These were offset by strong asset returns, contributions and favorable exchange. These results are clear evidence that our de-risking strategy is working. Of the $9 billion underfunded status, about $6.5 billion, or about 70% is associated with unfunded plans. Asset returns in 2014 for our U.S. plans were 16.4% and 15.7% for our non-U.S. plans, reflecting fixed income gains as interest rates fell, as well as strong growth asset returns. We\u2019ve continued to increase the mix of fixed income assets with the objective of reducing funded status volatility. The fixed income mix in our U.S. plans at year-end 2014 was 77% and that's up from 70% at year-end 2013. The U.S. plans were 97% funded at year-end. Slide 25 summarizes our 2014 results for our planning assumptions and key metrics, compared with the plan we shared at the beginning of the year. We delivered solid results last year, meeting or exceeding all financial metrics established at the beginning of the year, with the exception of total company pre-tax profit. Despite a challenging environment, particularly in South America and Russia and an unprecedented number of product launches, we achieved the total company pre-tax profit of $6.3 billion, which as Mark said was consistent with our most recent guidance of about $6 billion. Importantly, we also continued to generate positive Automotive operating related cash flow. So, overall, 2014 was a successful step forward in implementing our One Ford plan to deliver profitable growth for all. So this concludes our review of the financial details of our fourth quarter earnings and now, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Mark who is going to take us through our outlook for the business in 2015 looking at the environment, as well as our planning assumptions and key metrics. Mark Fields : Thanks Bob. Let\u2019s take a look at the 2015 year, starting on slide 26, with our view of the business environment going forward. We project global economic growth to be in the 3% range, which is going to be led by U.S. and China. Global industry sales are expected to growth to between 88 million and 92 million units, after estimated sales of about 88 million units in 2014. U.S. economic growth is projected in the 3% range. Consumer sentiment is improving, along with lower fuel prices, which will boost consumer spending, providing support for growth. South America faces continued market volatility and policy uncertainty. A weak recovery is expected in Brazil, while Argentina and Venezuela will remain in recession. In Europe, growth in the euro area slowed after the first quarter of 2014, but it is projected at just above 1% in 2015. In the U.K., growth is projected to remain in the 2.5% to 3% range. In Russia, the combination of lower oil prices, geopolitical events, and ruble depreciation will lead to a sharp decline in GDP and higher inflation. In Asia Pacific, China's economic growth is projected in the 7% to 7.5% range. Consumer income growth will support an increase in vehicle sales but at a more moderate pace this year. And with some encouraging signs of improvement, growth in India is projected to rise above 6% in 2015, supported by a more favorable policy environment. So stepping back, despite challenges in some key markets, we do expect the global economy to grow in 2015 and be supportive of a projection for higher global industry volume this year. On slide 27, we summarize our 2015 outlook for our Automotive sector and Ford Credit. We expect North America to be strongly profitable a level higher than 2014, with an operating margin of 8% to 9%. This outlook includes higher market share and net pricing, reflecting the impact of launching seven all-new or significantly refreshed products, as well as the effect of the record 16 launches in 2014, many of which occurred late in the year. And keep in mind, the F-150 changeover and downtime at our Kansas City plant will impact the first quarter. In South America, pre-tax results are expected to be substantially improved from 2014 but still a loss. This outlook reflects the continuation of difficult macroeconomic conditions, with industry volume about equal to 2014. We expect higher market share in 2015, as a result of new product introductions including the all-new car. We also expect higher net pricing in part due to new products, but also to recover or at least in part, the unfavorable effects of weaker currencies and high local inflation. And finally, our South American results will not include the operating results of our Venezuela operations, including any impact of currency devaluations. Moving on to Europe, pre-tax results are expected to improve from 2014, but still be a loss. This outlook reflects higher market share, volume and net pricing in the Europe 20 markets despite intense competition across the region, as well as weak economic growth in the euro area. This is updated from our September Investor Day guidance of a loss of about $250 million, that's largely due to uncertainty around conditions in Russia, as well as higher pension expense in 2015, as a result of even lower discount rates. Middle East and Africa is expected to deliver a loss somewhat larger than 2014, as we invest for future growth. And in Asia Pacific, we expect wholesale volume, market share and pre-tax profit to be higher than 2014, as we continue to introduce new products and bring on line new capacity. Our Automotive net interest expense is expected to be equal to or higher than 2014. And finally, Ford Credit continues to implement its growth plan and expects pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014. This outlook reflects year-end managed receivables in a range of $123 billion to $128 billion and managed leverage to continue in the range of 8 to 9 to 1, and distributions of about $250 million. So moving on, let\u2019s look at the expected calendarization of total company 2015 pre-tax results. So our slide 28 shows, directionally, the counterization of our profits in 2014 will not be consistent with our typical historical trend. In North America, the all-new F-150 changeover and downtime at the Kansas City plant will affect first quarter results. We also will incur costs and lost volume in the first half of the year related to our seven 2015 product launches, including the Edge and Explorer. And we expect to see the benefit of these launches in the second half of 2015. In Asia Pacific, we are leveraging Ford's global product portfolio to introduce 18 new vehicles in 2015. And this will result in lower first half results, as we continue to invest in four new plants that will bring new capacity on line for the second half of this year. So now let\u2019s take a look at the total company planning assumptions and key metrics for 2015, which is shown on slide 29. So for 2015, we now expect U.S. industry volume to range from 17 million to 17.5 million units. Europe 20 markets to range from 14.8 million to 15.3 million units and China to range from 24.5 million to 26.5 million units. In terms of our financial metrics, we expect automotive revenue and operating margin to be higher than 2014, automotive and operating-related cash flow to be higher than 2014. And as noted earlier, this is an improvement from our September Investor Day guidance of positive. And this also includes capital spending of about $7.5 billion. Ford Credit pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014, and company pre-tax profit to range from $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion. So overall very strong growth and substantially improved financial performance are expected in 2015, driven by our investments in new products and capacity. So closing all this out on the next slide, our priorities remain consistent and that's to accelerate the pace of progress of our One Ford plan, deliver product excellence with passion, and drive innovation in every part of our business. And all of this underpinned with the continuing day-to-day focus on operational excellence. We are committed to our long-term objectives that we shared with you and we're making progress towards them, as we execute our strategic framework. And this framework is built on strong brands, serving all markets with the complete family of best-in-class vehicles, to lead and providing innovative mobility solutions through our Ford\u2019s mobility initiatives and deliver operational excellence that is among the best in the business. And our success depends on a skilled and motivated team and the Ford team is among the best in the business and we intend to ensure that we have the right talent for rapidly changing world, and that we maintain the trust and the familiarity that allows us to rely on each other strengths to tackle any business issue. Looking ahead, the global automotive industry presents substantial growth opportunities as well as rapid change and we intend to take advantage of both. 2015 is going to be a breakthrough year for Ford, driven by our unprecedented 24 global product launches in 2014, and another 15 global launches planned this year. So this is our One Ford story and we\u2019re confident in its continued success. So at this point, let's open it up for questions. George? George Sharp : Thanks, Mark. Now we'll open the lines for about a 45-minute Q&A session. We'll begin as usual with questions from the investment community and then we'll take some questions from the media. Now again in order to allow for as many participants as possible within this limited timeframe please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two. Chantelle, can we have the first question. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi. Please proceed. Itay Michaeli : Good morning, everyone. Mark Fields : Good morning, Itay. Itay Michaeli : Just a question on Europe. I was hoping we can dig it a little bit more to the details around some of the incremental headwinds. You mentioned the pension expense in 2015. There may be a big picture view on kind of what it takes now as you look at the market to return to profitability. Maybe an update on what you think the reasonable timetable there and what else you can do to take action to respond to conditions there. Mark Fields : Well, as you step back and you look at Europe, we've had some success in meaningfully improving the business in Europe when you look at the three elements of the transformation brand, product, and cost. On the product side, we've introduced over half of the 25 products that we said we were going to introduce. We increased our share as we mentioned earlier. Importantly, the investments we made in commercial vehicles are paying off. We've gone from the number seven commercial vehicle market share brand to number three last year. So we made progress on product. We made progress on brand. Our favorability is improving. Our channel mix is improving. And actually channel mix of retail and fleet is healthier than the rest of the industry, about three points above. We made progress on cost, as we completed the restructuring actions. And as you know, that will save us ongoing between $450 million and $500 million a year. As we look at the industry going forward, as Bob mentioned, we\u2019re impacted by the lower discount rates, which impact our pension cost. Obviously, the situation in Russia is going to continue to impact us and will be a drag on our earnings for a period of time. As we look at the industry, we\u2019re seeing -- we do think that some of the impacts of lower energy costs will help the consumer, which will be positive. On the same token, we also know that there are still a lot of challenges that Europe faces. And our approach going forward, we are going to continue to use our process, Itay, which is used that creating value roadmap process, continue to look at the business environment, understand any additional actions that we need to take to improve the business situation, and that's what we\u2019re going to do. In terms of guidance on profitability, we\u2019re going to be -- our objective is to be profitable as soon as possible using those elements, I just outlined. Itay Michaeli : That\u2019s very helpful, Mark. And then just two quick follow-up housekeeping questions. Any guidance on the year-over-year P&L impact from the Venezuela accounting change, maybe what the 2014 losses were and what the benefit could be in 2015? And then maybe I missed this, but you have a 2015 CapEx outlook, that would be great. That\u2019s all I have. Bob Shanks : Okay. On the last one, Mark mentioned on the last -- next last slide I think that our guidance of $7.5 billion is just a touch-up from the $7.4 billion that we saw in 2014. On Venezuela, we\u2019re not providing -- we don't generally provide specific profitability on either markets or product lines. We did lose money in Venezuela, but it's been very volatile. I mean, I think that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s been most difficult about the market in terms of financial effect. So going forward, as we explained in the 8-K, Itay, there'll be no effect on the company's results from what happens in Venezuela. Other than if we can obtain cash from the authorities in Venezuela and use that cash to either remit a dividend or use that cash to purchase components that we could then ship into Venezuela to support production, then the profit or the cash flow associated with that transaction will be reflected in our results, but otherwise nothing. So there will be no effect. If we get no further cash, we require components. Or if we can't obtain components to ship in, there will be no effect on our results from Venezuela. Itay Michaeli : Great. That's very helpful. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Mark Fields : Hey, John. John Murphy : Just a first question. If we think about the guidance for North America margins of 8% to 9% for the full year and then the cadence of earnings that you\u2019ve kind of alluded to on slide 28, it would indicate that the margins in the second half of the year, maybe even in the second quarter in North America will be 10% or potentially higher. Should we think about that as a more normal operating environment or more normal level that you might be able to achieve in the future versus what we will see early in the year? Just trying to understand that. Bob Shanks : Yes. What we said consistently for a number of years is North America should run between 8% to 10%. Of course, that\u2019s going to vary. It depends on the quarter. It depends on where we are in product cadence launch cycles, what's happening in the external environment, what competition might be doing so, but it should range. And then in fact if you look at prior to '14, we\u2019ve kind of averaged a bit over 9% from '10 through '13. We did better the last two of those years, but then we got into the big launch period. And we said we'd be in the 8% to 9% range this year. We thought low-end, we came in sort of mid. So Joe and the team did a great job in the fourth quarter, particularly on cost and so we did better than we thought. As we move into next year, 8% to 9% continues to be the guidance. We are affected by the launches in the first quarter not just F-Series, but some other very high margin products that Mark mentioned, the Explore and the Edge and we actually have still a very active Europe launches in North America, I think seven overall. So it will have an impact in the first half, primarily first quarter. So your thesis is right. We\u2019ll see a lower margin than on average through the year in the first quarter. It will start to recover and be very attractive in the second, third and fourth and give us the type of margin that we\u2019re describing for the full year. And we will see how things work out. We might have the opportunity to operate at the higher end of that range but I think it's a bit too early to say. I would rather let the year kind of go underway, see how all these launches go. And as you know, S-series went very, very well and then we\u2019ll kind of update you as the year goes on. John Murphy : Okay. Then just a second question on Asia-Pac. You don\u2019t think the results in China are coming through pretty strong, the JV net income or equity income as $1.3 billion almost. Yet, it looks like the rest of the business is really under some pretty significant pressure. For the full year, you posted almost the $700 million loss. I know you\u2019ve alluded to some actions there but is there anything else that you need to do as far as rationalization of restructuring in that business that would be more concrete and provide for better results going forward. And what would the charges look like for that or what would be the actions look like for that? Mark Fields : Well, when you step back, John, and you look at the results outside, obviously, part of it is due to just the business environment that we\u2019re dealing with there and the currencies. But we focus on the things we can control and to your point, as you know in Australia, we\u2019re restructuring the business. We\u2019re closing our plant there in 2016, so we\u2019re working our way through that. And also at the same time introducing -- we\u2019ll have 30% more products in the market over the next couple of years to drive the topline as we\u2019re working the cost side to hopefully improve the bottomline. In India, it's about the investments we\u2019re making for growth. As you know, we\u2019re opening our second major assembly facility there, which is not only going to support the domestic market but is going to be an export hub for us as well. So we\u2019re working on that and we\u2019re seeing the upfront investments around that, which is driving the situation. We\u2019re starting to see as you\u2019ve heard in my remarks earlier, a little bit more encouraging results. We expect from an economic standpoint, which should help domestically. And ASEAN working our way through not only the business environments there, but looking at each and every country to make sure that we have the appropriate product lineup that we take advantage of some of the opportunities and strength that we have in some of our particular products and use that to drive our business higher. But the team is very focused on that piece of the business, so in total Asia Pacific can contribute equally. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Mark Fields : Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Rod Lache : Good morning, everybody. Mark Fields : Good morning, Rod. Rod Lache : A couple things, one, your content costs in North America was, like an $18 million headwind, which seems pretty modest considering the magnitude of the new product ramp that you're going through. I was hoping you can give us some sense of how we should be thinking about that for 2015. Looking at the Europe business, perhaps you can give us some brackets around the year-over-year impact, you\u2019re anticipating from Russia? And then lastly, since you guys gave guidance, oil prices obviously dropped pretty dramatically, 40%, 50%. Europe adopted pretty aggressive QE. A lot of people view that it\u2019s likely mitigating rate increases in the U.S. I guess kind of high level when you think about the changes that have occurred since the end of September. How do those influence your views on the outlook for North America to 2015 because I think you were expecting pretty flat earnings, net of the non-recurrence of charges last year? Mark Fields : Thanks, Rod. Bob, you should take the first two and I will take the last one. Bob Shanks : You want to take the last one first. Okay. Yeah. Sure. In terms of looking at the changes that you mentioned, obviously, the drop in the oil prices will be good for consumers and we think that will help the economy. As you saw Rod, we are expecting some growth in the industry so far. We haven't -- we look -- we take a look back and see if there was any correlation between low fuel prices and growth of the industry and there\u2019s not a lot of correlation there. So we\u2019re very comfortable with our call for the industry, which is really driven by replacement demand because as you know, the industry is run under replacement demand for five years. So we think that provides a good foundation. In terms of the mix and what that means for segmentation, could be an opportunity but we really don't know yet, the impact of lower oil prices what that means for the industry here in the U.S. If we look at the fourth quarter, what we saw in the fourth quarter was very consistent segmentation changes that we see seasonally over the years. You see full-size pickups rise because manufacturers are getting more aggressive. You see premium rise or some of the luxury OEMs go for leadership and you see small cars actually go down. So we think, we'll see the first quarter will be key to gauge if there is changes in the segmentation because as you know, on the first quarter we usually see small vehicles and small cars actually go up as a percent of the industry. But stepping back at a high level, we think it's positive for the economy, positive for the consumer and that is the backdrop. Bob? Mark Fields : Okay. Rod, in terms of the first question around the content, you didn\u2019t see much in the way of material cost in the quarter because the amount of new product that we actually wholesaled in the quarter wasn\u2019t that material if you will. You\u2019ll start to see that more fully in the first quarter when we report in April because what you had is you had a really good strong material cost reductions that the team delivered that you largely mitigated, the effect of what we did see in terms of product cost. So in \u201815, the North America is going to see a much, much stronger business. As we said earlier, we\u2019re going to have lot of growth in terms of volume. We\u2019re going to have higher share. We\u2019re going to have much stronger net pricing and that\u2019s on the back of the products that we launched last year, which will have full year effects this year, along with the ones that we will newly launch largely in the first quarter of this year. But with that what you will see, is you\u2019ll see a substantial increase in product costs and you'll also see higher structural cost. And particularly, if you go back to the F-150 program, given the scope with that program, the degree of which we had to change and re-facilitize the facilities, that piece will obviously be with us for most of the year, given the timing of the launch of the Kansas City. So very, very strong improvement in the top line but you will see cost increases flowing through both the product level and structural level. Bob Shanks : In terms of Europe, it\u2019s interesting. When you look at Europe and you go back to the transformation plan that Stephen Odell and his team announced back in, it was October of 2012. In that, Russia was an important element because we had data decision to go with a local partner, which has been good. At the time, we were looking at an industry that could grow to 4 million units, I think it was by the end of the decade. It was at sometime between then and the end of the decade going to become the largest industry in Europe and of course that\u2019s all changed. And it's just a difficult situation. We\u2019re looking now at industry volume this year that\u2019s probably sub 2 million units. You got very high interest rates. You\u2019ve got the collapse of the ruble. You've also got -- in our case for example, in all the euro based manufacturers, very aggressive pricing to respond to the change of the ruble versus the euro. And then with our competitors, particularly, the Japanese and then the Koreans as well, would have not had the price as much because their currencies have already weakened relative to the euro and the dollar. So there\u2019s a change in the competitive environment within Russia as well, which we\u2019re trying to respond to. So we do expect to see a big headwind from Russia in 2015 and that is the major change in the guidance that we are providing versus what we said in September. And when you think about it, the question you are going to ask me actually, well, you wrote of your equity in the second quarter of your 50-50 JV. So you\u2019d said at that time that won\u2019t have any financial effects on you if they were too and continue to incur losses which is true, but we still provide components and make money on those components, we still provide after service parts, make money on those, we still engineer the products, that they will ultimately build and sell, so we are incurring that expense and for that we receive royalties, which of course, are going to be lower, all of that\u2019s lower because of the volumes are lower. But in addition, frankly, because of the very difficult situation, the business is facing there, the partners are having to provide additional support for the business and of course, we are working very closely together to respond to what is a dramatically different to what we thought even six months ago. Mark Fields : And just to Bob\u2019s point, we are acting very proactively on Russia. We are -- we have got production. We reduced overhead. But also we are working topline. As you know, we are introducing six new products between midyear last year and into 2015. And so, I guess, I\u2019d term it there is never bad time to introduce good product in any market and that\u2019s our approach. Rod Lache : Hey. Can you bracket the impact that you are expecting, it see like, you\u2019ve changed a lot over there, but what is the magnitude? Bob Shanks : Well, the only thing, I have to guide you through in the appendix, you can see the year-over-year effect of Russia on Europe and it was $350 million and all I\u2019ll say is that the environment in 2015 is more difficult. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Adam Jonas : Thanks everybody. Can you remind us how much of the pickup truck market in North America last year or whatever period that you have -- that's recent relevant is tied to oil and gas end markets and maybe the Great Lone Star State specifically? Mark Fields : Well, Adam, this is Mark. We don't have a specific number. But, obviously, it's a piece of it. Obviously, the biggest piece of pickup truck is the housing market. But what we've seen is, there could be some, as we step back and we look at the energy prices and what that may mean, for example, for wellhead, drilling and all that kind of those types of things. It could have a slight negative impact in let say the Southwest. But keep in mind we could see positive impact in the rest of the country from lower fuel prices with more money in consumer\u2019s pockets, plus the other thing that's encouraging, you look at the latest housing numbers in terms of starts and permits, et cetera. We could see an offset on that. So that's basically the way I would characterize it. Adam Jonas : Okay. Thanks Mark. And this is a follow-up, what would your team rank as a more worrisome issue to you, the strong U.S. dollar or these cafe standards that are kind of completely out of touch in reality beyond 2017? And a follow on to that, maybe could Ford way in on where, on the issue of raising the gasoline tax, you guys have any dog in that hunt? Thanks. Mark Fields : Okay. Well, let me take a last one first, the gasoline tax, our position is, we will leave that to the policymakers to figure out whether they have support for that and what we are in support of is the things that we can control and what we can control is continue to have the team focused on delivering affordable and fuel-efficient vehicles to the market that people want and value. So that\u2019s our approach. In terms of the two things you mentioned, the impact of the strong dollar. As Bob mentioned, we are not seeing a big bottomline affect on our financials in 2015, because it's a multifaceted thing. On the positive side, a strong U.S. dollar indicate strengthen our economy and obviously, that's good, given our position in the market here and it\u2019s our largest and most profitable. Alternatively, a strong dollar has an effective, as Bob mentioned, on our competitive position, especially against competitors who import here into the U.S. and they could take it through pricing, reduce pricing or increase content. So as we think about that, for exchange, for exchange movements that are driven by the markets and not by governments will deal with the hand that were given and use our creating value that process to improve the situation. On the regulatory, it is a big issue as you know to meet those requirements. It's going to be very important for consumers to adopt the new technologies, the electrified vehicles, et cetera, and that's an important part of meeting the countries goals. And what we are seeing right now is, they are not adopting to the levels anywhere near that we expected. So, that's why we're very looking forward to the midterm review with the government and as you know to agree to the one national standard. We wanted to make sure we had a midterm review to look at the feasibility of the goals, cost to the consumer, impact on jobs, et cetera. So that's probably the one that -- is the one that we focused a lot on, because it requires a market response from that and adoption, and we are not seeing at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Please proceed. Colin Langan : My first question, can you just give a broad update of the F-150 launch, the Dearborn plant ramping, is it fully ramped at this point as Kansas City on schedule and do you have any color of the new F-150 is pricing, any color around on pricing in particular? Second question is on foreign exchange, how are you being impacted by FX, because you are expected to lose money in Europe and South America. So just some of the volatility there actually shrink the translation of losses, is that a net positive to you or is the intraregional FX impact more than offsetting that? Mark Fields : Okay. Thanks, Colin. I\u2019ll take the first one. And I\u2019m surprised it took that long to get an F-150 your question, but I am glad we did. We are exactly on plan, where we expected to be with the F-150 launch. We have added the third crew at our Dearborn truck plant. We are almost completely through the acceleration curve, little bit more time on that, but that's going smoothly. In Kansas City, we have installed the equipment into the body shop and the team is going through the debugging right now. So that is absolutely on plan. As you look at the market response. As we noted in December, we are seeing very strong demand for the F-150. It's our fastest turning vehicle on the lot and actually as we look at this month, we have a few more days to close you, if we track as we expected, we could have our best January since 2004 and we'll see material increase in terms of the percent of our 2015 F-150s as a percent of our total sales. The rich -- the mix has been rich, which is good and just anecdotally, we were in the NADA Convention this week and talking with dealers. And I had a number of dealers telling me that they haven't even driven the truck home yet, because literally as soon as they are showing up on the vehicle transport they are going out. So very, very encouraging initial response to the F-150 and we are bang on where we expected to be in terms of our launch. Bob? Bob Shanks : Yeah. Colin, in terms to your question on exchanges, I am kind of looking at 2015. It doesn't broadly across the company. There's some ups and downs, but doesn't seem to have much of the material impact. I think you are technically right, where we have losses like in South America and Europe, just look at the translation effect, obviously, the loss in local currency will translate into fewer dollars. But there other flows, you have got pounds, you have got euros, you have got a number of different currencies that play there. But broadly for the whole company, it is not having much of an effect there. The other, I won\u2019t talk again about the competitive factor, I think that\u2019s the bigger concern that we have in terms of the impact on the businesses, the competitive factor that Mark touched on, but he handle that. So the only other thing, I would say is, I think, when we are having conversations around exchange and particular a strong dollar, we\u2019d probably also should at least comment on commodities, because there is a correlation between the dollar and commodities, and well many currencies and commodities. And what we are seeing, in fact, as the dollar has strengthened, we are starting to see good news on the horizon from commodities, it\u2019s pretty much across most commodities and we think that will actually be a help for the business in 2015. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Please proceed. Brian Johnson : Yes. Good morning. Mark Fields : Good morning, Brian. Brian Johnson : Just given volatility of fuel prices, I want to ask a question, we haven\u2019t really talked about for awhile, which is around the flexibility in your factories to go back and forth between CUV and Sedan, because it really seams the consumer is rotating away from Sedan towards CUV\u2019s. A couple of -- three questions, one, can you recap just what factories you have right now that currently can go back and forth between the two? Two do see more scope for doing that, perhaps as you\u2019ve rollover some platforms in the next few years, so you have the flexibility? And three, do you currently have with work rules, layoffs, reassignment, provisions the kind of flexibility in your union contracts, you would need to kind of get to the nirvana being able to flex to where the customer demand is? Mark Fields : Thanks Brian. Let me take the last one first, when you look at the flexibility, if you recall back in the 2011 contract, very importantly, we came to agreements with our UAW colleagues around improved flexibility. And that has worked wonderfully for us over the last number of years in terms of adding Saturday hours or increased shifts, et cetera. In terms of the flexibility between cars and CUV\u2019s, I don't know the number off the top of my head in terms of the number of plants. But I would say it's fairly limited in terms of a plant that produces a car and a CUV and utility. But we do have opportunities, as we see the market move, again using that flexibility, the work rule flexibility that we have with the unions to either add additional weekend days or in some cases increase line rates. And to your second point about going forward, obviously, that's something that we continue to look at as we plan our product cycles and our manufacturing, optimizing our manufacturing footprint to take into account shifts and then can we get the flexibility that we want in our manufacturing plants. I mean, we do have that, for example in a plant, in Wayne, Michigan, where we produce a number of different vehicles and engines, but we\u2019ll continue to look at that going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Please proceed. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I know you discussed the impact of fuel prices on segment mix earlier and that\u2019s important? But looking at from a different perspective, can help us in terms of sizing up maybe your annual logistics and freight expense? How to think about, how that could be impacted by say a 50% drop in fuel prices, whether we should be taking that into account in our models? Bob Shanks : Yeah. That\u2019s sort of a corollary to the commodities. The oil price decline is going to give us the opportunity to see reductions in logistics expenses and we are already seen it as an opportunity for this year. So you are spot on. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Great. And then, I guess, as a follow-up to that, I know you have pass-through agreements with suppliers to compensate them when commodity prices rise and to recoup those savings when they fall? Do have a way to capture the change in the supplier\u2019s logistics expenses or are they sort of permitted to keep that? Bob Shanks : That would probably be subject to negotiation with them. But we do issue as you said, when we talked about it before, we do have indexing across parts of our supply base related to commodities. So as they go up, there is adjustment, as they go down, there is adjustments. So, I think, the logistics impact just as it is for us as it more indirect impact. But, certainly, we are aware of that and we\u2019d hope to capture that as that opportunity occurs at the level of the supplier. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Mark Fields : And also just to add to that, we manage a lot of the inbound logistics into our plant. So we\u2019ll work that aspect as well in terms of what we can control. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just last question for me on China, lot\u2019s of talk of China slowdown recently, but actually it hasn't slowed, we continue to see all-time record highs there, 25 plus millions are in December, et cetera? How are you thinking about China industry in 2015? What\u2019s the latest you are seeing on the ground and if sales did slow, does that necessarily impact your plans and you are also getting a lot of market share? Mark Fields : Great, Ryan. As we look at China, we are still -- we still see growth as you saw from our projections, we expect it to be between 24.5 million and 26.5 million units. And again a lot of that growth is coming from the Tier 3 through 6 cities, as consumers, their income rises and they are able to buy a vehicle. As we look at the industry, overall, you we had our record market share there last year of 4.5% and as I mentioned, record number of wholesales. We expect our business to grow again this year and the reason for that is, because we\u2019re bringing on another plant. We just launched our Escort the end of last year. We have a number of products coming this year, which are products that actually increase our segment breathe. So it's not just about introducing a new product in the segment we are already in, it\u2019s introducing products into segments we have not been in. So we think that that provides a good basis for us and we are coming off a position of strength, the brand is held in high regard, the focus was the best-selling nameplate again for the second or third year in a row and our buyers are tend to be younger and have higher income than the industry average and working with our partners, we have really built out our distribution network particularly in those 3 -- Tier 3 through 6 cities. So we expect growth not as much in the industry as we saw last year for the reasons I cited earlier, but we are very encouraged by the positive response we might get from our new products to help grow our business. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA. Please proceed. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Mark Fields : Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner : I wanted to drill down a little bit more on the earnings impact from some of the large investments you made last year. Also in those markets specifically you mentioned before you expect stronger volume share and pricing, but also a substantial increase in product costs and structural costs? So wanted to just ask on both these things? First of all, on the product cost versus pricing, do you expected to be net positive this year and then on the structural cost, I don\u2019t know, if you\u2019ll provide guidance specifically on that, but by how much you expect D&A to increase this year, obviously, you have been running at $4 billion plus when you are spending $7.5 on CapEx. So do you expect a substantial increase in D&A this year? Mark Fields : Yeah. Let me take that. So if I look at the company and I look at our structural costs, they will be up more than they were in 2014 versus \u201913. The biggest factors of that will actually be engineering and manufacturing, and some of that not just because of what we've already done, but obviously, we are still investing for even more growth in the years ahead, particular if you go back to Investor Day and think about the type of growth that we are projecting up through 2020. So those are the two biggest factors. But we will see an increase in D&A, I am not going to provide a specific number, it\u2019s not, by any means the largest of the elements that we will see next year, but it will be a good increase in terms of the size. And again that is related to investments that we will -- have already made or perhaps some made during the year. In terms of pricing, we will see strong positive pricing both for product-related actions and as we always do and that was evident in the fourth quarter too in terms of the pricing that we achieved around the world that where we can opportunistically take pricing on related to product, we will do that and I would expect that to be the case again in 2015. But, again, we have to be very sensitive to the competitive position in that place back into some of the earlier comments around what the Japanese competitors in particular may do, particularly in the super segment vehicles. But we\u2019ll have very strong pricing and again obviously since we expect the results for the company and for North America to be better, we do expect for the combination of the volume, the revenue that we\u2019ll see more of that in terms of the positive effect than we will to the combination of cost increases that we see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Patrick Archambault : Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. Actually, just one for me, the increased free cash flow guidance from positive to higher, what are the main drivers behind that? Bob Shanks : Well, when we gave the guidance of positive, I mean, we were just saying that we were -- there wasn\u2019t going to be next. It\u2019s going to be positive cash flow and that we were waiting because obviously as you know cash flow was a change of a change to some extent. So we want to see how we did in 2014. So now we have a good baseline. We can look and understand what we\u2019re looking at for 2015. So clearly, we\u2019re going to see it driven by the top line. So the profitability is going to be a lot stronger. We see about no change in terms of the CapEx. We\u2019ve already talked about that, the 7.5 versus 7.4. And then I think the changes that we\u2019ll see in working capital and timing differences are not that material in terms of preventing us from seeing the fuller flow-through of what's happening on the improved profitability. So I think that the profits are probably the single biggest driver that will flow through to the operating profitability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak of RBC. Please proceed. Joseph Spak : Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask another F-150 question but this one about maybe the initial fleet reception. I mean, you\u2019ve talked about maintaining if not improving the cost of ownership. Obviously we saw the mpgs on the new versus the old and that feels a little bit lower So maybe less of a benefit there. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the Edmunds\u2019 report which showed that the labor to replace aluminum could be, maybe 4X steel and maybe 2X the time. So I was wondering are there offsets to that cost of ownership that we\u2019re not considering. I mean, I know the residuals are little bit higher but wanted to see how that pitch to fleet is going? And then related, I guess, how are you supporting the repair shops both four dealers and the independents with getting up to speed on aluminum? Mark Fields : Great. Thanks Joseph for that question. And when you look at the F-150 in terms of the response from the fleets, obviously we\u2019re just starting to ship. And as you mentioned, total cost of ownership is very important to them and their interest in the vehicle is very high. And we\u2019re just starting to ship vehicles to them in that regard. And we think it's going to go well. All you have to do is, I know, it\u2019s a different vehicle. But if you look at our transit for example, which we launched last year, if you look at even in the month of December, we had a higher share in the van and bus segment since 2006 with the new products. So as you know, what fleets do is they take a few units first. They get some experience with them. And once they have good experience with them, they really start ramping up the orders. And we expect to see that with F-150. In terms of cost of ownership and this gets back to what the purchasing managers are looking at, as we\u2019ve said, the total cost of ownership for the new F-150 is going to be very competitive. We saw the Edmunds\u2019 report and unfortunately the experience with that -- that with the dealer was incorrect. The amount of time to repair based on the standards that we've developed and also shared with the dealers, it would have been about half the time. So it wasn't quite correct. At the same time, as you know, we designed the F-150 so that when there are issues, body issues, et cetera that the way we designed it from a modular standpoint, it's actually very efficient to actually repair the vehicle. So overall, in terms of what we've done, we've trained over 750 dealers to be certified. Unfortunately this dealer that this Edmunds went to was not one of them that they've not gone through that yet. But we have certified over 750 and we worked with over 1000 independent body shops to get them ready for the F-150 but overall, with the overall competitive, a very competitive cost of ownership. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Alisa Priddle of Detroit Free Press. Alisa Priddle : Good morning, gentlemen. Mark Fields : Hi, Alisa. Alisa Priddle : Good morning. So just couple things. First, I didn't catch what the percentage of the mix was of the new F-150s, when you were talking about sales in January? And secondly, Mark, I was hoping you would just talk a little bit about your continued efforts to make quality a priority, given that there was an additional $1.3 billion in warranty costs in 2014? Mark Fields : Very good, Alisa. As I mentioned in December, 5% of our total F series was the new F-150. In January, we still have a month yet to close but you'll see a number higher than that, as we close out January, as we stock up the units and as we get them to customers. So, you will see a higher number or a higher percentage. In terms of quality as you know, we've had a lot of focus on quality. We've had great progress around the world. We've seen some of our own internal surveys of initial quality to be very positive, particularly around the vehicles that we\u2019ve launched because traditionally we've had some issues around launch. And I think the team is doing a very good job on making sure that the quality that we send on our new products is what customers expect and we are seeing that progress verified by third-party results, whether it's J.D. Power or even Consumer Report. So we are going to stay very focused on that. Alisa Priddle : Okay. Were there any lessons learned from what you saw in 2014 or, are recalls just too unpredictable? Mark Fields : Well, it\u2019s difficult to predict recalls and some of those were obviously on some older models and we took a lot of lessons from 2012 and \u201913. And the team has used that to help our launches actually in 2014. So, hopefully, we\u2019ll see that reflected in our volume results in potentially recalls going forward but we will wait and see. Alisa Priddle : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ramsey of Wall Street Journal. Please proceed. Mike Ramsey : Hey. Good morning, everybody. So, I know that you guys have new guidance to 2020. But I am curious. I know that the mid-term guidance for the mid-decade at one point was $8 million sales globally and were a couple million off of that. Did things not go as quickly in terms of ramping up your global sales as expected and if so, where was it not as fast as you anticipated? Mark Fields : Right. Thanks Mike. When we actually announced the mid-decade guidance back in 2011, we said it was euro assumptions. And at that point in time, Europe hadn't tanked and South America hadn\u2019t imploded. So when you take all that into account, a lot of, if you look at what we projected in terms of the number of wholesales, we had an assumption around industry, around the world and regions and that's changed dramatically given some of the realities of the marketplace. That being said, as you look back on a number of things on the mid-decade guidance, we have actually achieved and we\u2019ve factored those into our 2020 guidance going forward. Mike Ramsey : Okay. So, do you feel pretty good though that with -- I know South America is a head scratcher a little bit, but do you think that some of these markets where you\u2019ve made big investments are going to pick back up again that we are going to -- with a stumbling you will see that previously anticipated growth? Mark Fields : Yes. We spend a lot of time on making sure that the capital that we allocate that we\u2019re going to earn an appropriate return. And if you look at South America, we know that the business environment in the region remains volatile, which is going to add uncertainty to the near-term outlook. But in the longer term, it's an attractive and important place to do business. We want to continue to serve our customers there. As you know, the previous decade, we made very good returns on our investments in South America and we expect that going forward in the medium to long-term. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin of Associated Press. Please proceed. Dee- Ann Durbin : Good morning. Mark Fields : Good morning. Dee- Ann Durbin : Thanks for taking the call. Can you just talk briefly about China market share and where you expect that to go this year? Mark Fields : Thanks, Dee-Ann. As we mentioned, we have a number of new products launching in new segments. We have two new plants coming on line in China, one an assembly plant and one an engine plant. So we expect in China that to positively impact our sales. We\u2019re not giving out a market share objective. Our objective usually is -- is usual around the world, as we are going to sell as many people want. And we've seen our share grow pretty dramatically there over the last two or three years. As we mentioned, we had a record last year at 4.5% in China. And we expect that to grow based on some of the new segments and we feel are compelling products for Chinese consumers. Dee- Ann Durbin : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe White of Thomson Reuters. Please proceed. Bernie Woodall : Hello. And this is Bernie Woodall imitating Joe White. Could you do me a favor and I know you\u2019ve talked a little bit about Europe already. But just looking at yesterday, Sergio Marchionne on the Chrysler call said things are going to be improved in Europe over a low base? And then if you have made profit in Europe in the fourth quarter, General Motors is looking to make return to profit next year. The casual observer might look at this and say, oh, what\u2019s Ford\u2019s problem in Europe? Can you address that into vis-\u00e0-vis your competition there? Thanks. Bob Shanks : Bernie, it\u2019s Bob and I'm sure, Mark will add comments. Again, I think, if you pull apart the business, we've made great, great progress on the European transformation plan, if I put Russia to the side. And you can see that in the results on a year-over-year basis, when you go through the data. We\u2019re seeing improvement in the topline. We gained in share. We actually held price on a year-over-year basis in a very, very competitive environment. And we saw a reduction in our cost, so everything is moving in the right directions. But as I said earlier, we've made a bet on Russia. We think that\u2019s going to be an important market in the future. It\u2019s going to grow. It\u2019s a commodity-based economy. So it\u2019s being hurt right now for what's going on in terms of oil prices as well as, of course the geopolitical issues. But we still have confidence that over time that could be an attractive market we\u2019d like to participate in there. And I don\u2019t know to what extent some of the competitors do or don't participate in the Russian market and what affect it would have on their results. But certainly that is probably the area that has the most impact versus what we had originally expected when we set out the transformation plan. And as Mark said earlier, we have lot of work underway to respond to very changed environment and to make sure that, as that market recovers then we can participate fully in that opportunity. Bob Shanks : And I\u2019d just add, we are going to continue to work our process and Bernie, as you know when you do comparisons, it is important that you look at the profiles of the various companies. And in our case, we are in Russia with our partners. Again, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case for some of our other competitors. I have to look at accounting treatments and things that were, that may have been gone away because of a bankruptcy or others that impact the results. So it's really making sure you do the appropriate kind of benchmarking between the two operations. But we\u2019re going to stay focused. It's an important market for us. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress. We have more headwinds, a lot of it driven by Russia and we\u2019ll deal with them positively. Bernie Woodall : Thank you. And if I could steal one more, you mentioned earlier, Bob, that by 2020 or few years ago, you were looking at $4 million in sales in Russia. Is there any venture of what\u2019s your guidepost there for 20 -- by the end of the decade in Russia, are you making any guess? Bob Shanks : Yeah. I think it\u2019s probably too uncertain to make a call at this point. Clearly, if you look at outside third-party forecast, those numbers have come way down. But one thing you have to be careful of with any of these more volatile economies is that when you are at a high because we don\u2019t project that out. When you are at low, you don\u2019t want to say that that\u2019s where we are going to be for the next five years rather because what goes up comes down, vice versa. But I think it's fairly probably is a less positive forecast at this point. But I think once we come out of it and our expectations are that Russia will be one of the larger industries in Europe over the mid long-term. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. George Sharp for closing remarks. Please proceed, sir.

My name is Mark and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to George Sharp, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Ford Motor Company. Please proceed, sir. George Sharp : Thank you, Mark and good morning. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning so we can provide you with additional details of our first quarter 2015 financial results. Copies of this morning\u2019s press release and presentation slides are available on Ford\u2019s investor and media websites. Presenting today are Mark Fields, President and CEO and Bob Shanks, Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO. Today\u2019s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford\u2019s future performance. Of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation and detailed in our SEC filings. Finally, any non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck. Our Form 10-Q is planned to be released this afternoon. With that, I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mark Fields. Mark Fields : Okay. Thanks, George and good morning, everybody. So, why don\u2019t we just get ready to the first slide? As you can see here, our plan for profitable growth and of course our focus as a business continue to deliver and they remain unchanged. And it starts with accelerating the pace of progress of our ONE Ford plan, while at the same time delivering product excellence and driving innovation in every part of our business. Going on to Slide 2, you can see that the first quarter was a good start to the year in which our results will grow progressively stronger as we launch the new products and we continue to build momentum. And while wholesales were about unchanged due to major product launches and the revenue was down mainly because of the effect of the stronger U.S. dollar on our international operations, we grew our global market share and achieved profitability in four of our six business units. We are updating our guidance for the year for some of our business units and we now expect North America\u2019s operating margin to be stronger than previously expected and that the loss in South America will be greater, but still an improvement from last year due to the deteriorating external conditions that we see there. We are also reconfirming that 2015 will be a breakthrough year for Ford, including company pre-tax guidance of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion with automotive revenue, our operating margin and operating related cash flow to be higher than 2014. On Slide 3, as we talk about our plan to deliver profitable growth, you can see that we delivered in the first quarter, from several new Ford and Lincoln products and new plants and facilities to being named the only automaker on the list of the World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies and growing our dividend, we are very pleased with our progress. So, with that, why don\u2019t I turn it over to Bob and then he will take us through the details. So, Bob, why don\u2019t you take away? Bob Shanks : Thanks, Mark and good morning everybody. Let\u2019s start at the top on Slide 4. Our first quarter wholesale volume was 1.6 million units, which was down 21,000 units from a year ago and the revenue was $33.9 billion, which was down $2 billion. Our pre-tax profit was $1.4 billion, $24 million better than a year ago and after-tax earnings per share at $0.23 or $0.02 lower. Net income attributable to Ford was $924 million that was $65 million lower than a year ago, more than explained by a higher operating tax rate this quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was $500 million. It was lower than a year ago due to less favorable working capital changes and higher net spending. Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $19.5 billion, exceeding debt by $6.1 billion. Our first quarter operating effective tax rate was 34% compared to 26% a year ago. The increase is mainly the geographic mix of our regional results. We expect our second quarter rate to be about 34% as well. And for the full year, we now expect our rate to be about equal to or higher than our 2014 rate of 26%. This outlook continues to assume extension of U.S. research credit legislations in the fourth quarter. And as you can see on Slide 5 both of our sectors automotive and financial services contributed to our first quarter pre-tax profit and both improved compared with the first and fourth quarters of 2014. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 6, where you can see the key market factors and financial metrics for our automotive business. Stepping back first and looking at the full year, we expect to achieve strong top line growth as we leverage a growing global industry, as well as improve our global market share on the strength of our 24 product launches last year and the 15 we have planned for 2015. We also have more capacity coming online in Asia-Pacific in the second half that will drive incremental volume and revenue. We also expect improvements to the bottom line, specifically higher automotive operating margin and strong growth in automotive pre-tax profit driven by North America and Asia-Pacific with improved results in Europe and South America as well. We continue to expect most of the company improvement to occur in the second half. Focusing now on the first quarter, we estimate that global industry SAAR shown on the lower left was 87.5 million units, that was up 1% from a year ago. And as already noted we grew our global market share to 7%. Wholesale volume was down slightly from a year ago due to the effects of major product launches, which contributed to lower dealer stock increases and constrained our share growth. Our revenue was down 6% due to the unfavorable exchange effects of the strong U.S. dollar on international operations, as well as a lower volume. We are very pleased that our operating margin improved, which at 3.6%, was up two-tenths of a percentage point and that our automotive pre-tax profit of $936 million was essentially unchanged from a year ago. As shown on Slide 7, our unchanged automotive pre-tax profit was the result of higher net pricing, favorable exchange and favorable mix. Higher cost and lower volume were offsets. The strong net pricing mainly reflects new products in North and South America as well as partial recovery in South America of the adverse operating effects of the region\u2019s weaker currencies and high local inflation. The non-repeat of unfavorable balance sheet exchange effects last year, primarily in Venezuela and Argentina, explains most of the favorable exchange. The good news on mix came from North America, primarily Super Duty, and in Europe, primarily Transit and Mondeo. The higher costs are driven principally by three factors : first, the effects of new products launched since the first quarter a year ago; secondly, new plants in Asia-Pacific launched over the past year or to be launched later this year; and finally, investments for future new products and capacity to support our growth beyond 2015. North America was the major driver of the lower volume due to product launch effects. As shown below the chart, automotive pre-tax profit improved over fourth quarter 2014 because of lower cost and favorable exchange. Slide 8 shows automotive pre-tax results by business unit, along with other automotive, which is mainly net interest expense. Previously, we have guided that we expected automotive net interest expense to be equal to or higher than last year\u2019s expense of $583 million. We now expect full year expense to be about $650 million, including the impact of the external debt of our Russia operation, Ford Sollers, which was fully consolidated as of March 31, along with incremental funding in Brazil. Before we move on to the business units, just a reminder here on Slide 9, we said back in January that we expect results in the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half due to the timing of our product and capacity launches. And as shown here, this is still the case. Now, what I would like to do is to take you through each of the automotive business units, starting with North America on Slide 10. We expect North America to have a very strong year in 2015 with substantial top line growth, higher pre-tax profit and an improved operating margin. This is based on continued robust industry sales, our strong product lineup, including products launched last year and planned for this year, our continued discipline in matching production with demand and a lean cost structure. In the quarter, wholesale volume and revenue were down 5% and 2% from a year ago respectively. The lower wholesale volume reflects launch related declines of about 40% for F-150 and over 50% for Edge. All other vehicles were actually up 7%. The declines for F-150 and Edge resulted in lower U.S. market share, which was down six-tenths of a percentage point to 14.7%, as well as lower stock increases this year than in 2014. Higher industry sales reflecting the U.S. SAAR of 17.1 million units were a partial offset. Our lower revenue in North America was driven by the lower wholesale volume, as well as the adverse effects on our revenue in Canada and Mexico of the strong U.S. dollar. This was offset largely by higher net pricing and favorable mix. North America operating margin was 6.7%, down six-tenths of a percentage point from last year and pre-tax profit was $1.3 billion, which was down $160 million. Let\u2019s now go to Slide 11 for a closer look at the factors behind the lower profit. As shown on this slide, lower volume for F-150 and Edge due to their launches explains North America\u2019s lower pre-tax profit in the first quarter. All other factors essentially offset one another. We expect results in North America to improve substantially over the balance of the year as we benefit from a full supply of F-150 and Edge, as well as other new products we have yet to launch including Explorer and Lincoln MKX. As shown below the chart, North America pre-tax profit declined compared with fourth quarter due to higher costs and lower volume. In terms of the full year guidance, we continue to expect North America to be strongly profitable this year at a level that will exceed last year\u2019s results. Today, we are increasing our operating margin guidance from 8% to 9% to 8.5% to 9.5%. This reflects our strong confidence in the F-150 and our positive view of the product\u2019s impact on our business now that the launch is successfully behind us. We also expect the recently launched Mustang, Transit and Edge to continue to perform strongly, and we are very excited about the upcoming launches of the Explorer and the MKX. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 12 and talk about South America. The business environment in South America has deteriorated beyond our expectations with negative GDP growth, continued high inflation, further currency weakness across the region. The industry pricing environment is also difficult, particularly in Brazil with actions taken to-date generally lagging the combined adverse effects of the weaker currencies and high local inflation. Our strategy of replacing legacy products with ONE Ford products is bearing fruit. The new Ka is improving our market share in the region, which at 9.7% was up a strong 1.1 percentage points. In Brazil, EcoSport and Fusion continue to lead their segments. And as a result of the success of the F-series and Cargo, Ford led the light and semi-light truck segments in the first quarter. As we continue to sustain a strong product lineup, our team in South America also is focused on finding other revenue opportunities, reducing cost, continuing to match production to real demand and increasing local content to mitigate further the adverse effects of the weak local currencies. In the first quarter, our wholesale volume and revenue decreased from a year ago by 3% and 20% respectively. The lower volume resulted from 1.1 million unit decline in industry SAAR, reflecting the impact of Brazil\u2019s weaker economy and Argentina import restrictions. Our revenue decline resulted from the weaker currencies and unfavorable volume and mix. Operating margin was a negative 12.5% with significant improvement from a year ago, while pre-tax loss was $189 million that was an improvement of $321 million. As we show on Slide 13, South America\u2019s profit improvement was due to favorable exchange, most of which reflects the non-repeat of last year\u2019s unfavorable balance sheet exchange effects of $310 million in Venezuela. Although volume was effectively unchanged, we are very proud that our team was able to offset the effective lower industry volume by growing our market share as shown on this chart in the colored box for volume and mix. As you can see below the chart, the first quarter loss was about the same as in fourth quarter of 2014. For the full year, we continue to expect our pre-tax loss to improve from 2014, but the loss now will be greater than what we had expected due to the more difficult external environment. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 14 and we will talk about Europe where we are continuing to implement our transformation plan focused on product, brand and cost. We confirmed earlier this month our commitment to the Russian market, where we agreed to certain changes with our partner, Sollers that will allow both parties to continue to support the Ford Sollers joint venture in the near-term, while providing a platform for future growth in this very important market. As a result of these changes, we consolidated our Russian operations as of March 31. This had no effect on first quarter earnings. In the quarter, our Europe 20 market share improved two-tenths of a percentage point to 8.2%. The success of our full line of transit vehicles and continued strong performance of our Ranger compact pickup contributed to a 2.8 percentage point improvement in our commercial vehicle share to 13.3%. In fact, Ford was the leading commercial brand in Europe 20 in the first quarter. Our Europe wholesale volume improved 2% from the year ago, while revenue declined 11%. The higher volume resulted from 1.2 million unit increase in the Europe 20 SAAR, which was 15.7 million units as well as from Ford\u2019s higher market share. This was offset largely by the non-repeat of last year\u2019s dealer stock increase. The strong U.S. dollar explains our lower revenue. Europe\u2019s operating margin was a negative 2.7%, down two-tenths of a percentage point from a year ago and the pre-tax loss was $185 million, which was unchanged. Although results were about the same as last year, you can see on Slide 15 that there was a lot of variability among the factors. Higher industry share and favorable mix were offset partially by the non-repeat of last year\u2019s stock increase. The lower net pricing was driven in part by the aging of selected vehicle lines, but a portion also resulted from higher incentive activity in the UK and Switzerland. This was driven in part by a more competitive activity that was triggered by a stronger pound, sterling and Swiss franc versus the euro that made sales in these two markets more attractive. In total, costs were about flat including the impact of lower discount rates on pension expense. As shown below the chart, first quarter pre-tax results improved from fourth quarter 2014 due to favorable market factors, lower cost and favorable exchange. For the full year, we continue to expect Europe\u2019s pre-tax loss to improve from 2014, including the consolidation of Ford Sollers. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 16 and review Middle East and Africa, where we are focused on building our distribution capability, expanding our ONE Ford product offering tailored to the needs of the markets in the region and leveraging our global low-cost sourcing hubs. Our wholesale volume and revenue declined 8% from a year ago. The lower volume was the result of unfavorable changes in dealer stocks, while the lower revenue reflects the lower volume as well as the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar. Operating margin was 7.5% that was 2.8 percentage points higher than a year ago and pre-tax profit was $79 million, an improvement of $25 million. This was driven by favorable exchange. For the full year, we now expect Middle East and Africa to deliver about breakeven results, which is an improvement from our prior guidance of a loss somewhat larger than 2014. Alright, let\u2019s now go to Slide 17 and we will talk about Asia Pacific. We are continuing our strategy in this region to invest for growth in incremental capacity, new products and of course Lincoln in China. We expect Asia Pacific to have a strong year with the top and bottom line results improving substantially in the second half versus the first half due to added capacity and new products to be launched from the middle of the year, notably the three row Edge, the all-new Taurus, Figo, the all-new Everest, the refreshed Ranger and the all-new Lincoln MKX. As shown on the left, our first quarter wholesale volume was up 5% compared with a year ago, while our net revenue which excludes our China JVs declined 14%. Our China wholesale volume, which isn\u2019t shown, was up 10% in the quarter. This reflects in part strong market reception to the all-new Escort, as well as Lincoln, which is off to an encouraging start with several of our China dealers already among the brand\u2019s highest volume dealers globally. Our higher volume in the region was driven by a favorable change in dealer stocks, including recovery of stocks to targeted levels. We estimate first quarter SAAR for the region at 38.9 million units, which is unchanged from a year ago although we did see signs of slowing growth in China during the quarter. Our first quarter market share for the region at 3.4% and our China market share at 4.5% were both equal to first quarter records set last year. The lower revenue was a result of the lower volume from our consolidated operations as well as weaker currencies. Operating margin was 4.5%, which was down 6.6 percentage points from a year ago and pre-tax profit was $103 million, down $188 million. Our China joint ventures contributed $360 million to pre-tax profit this quarter, reflecting our equity share of their after-tax earnings. On Slide 18, you can see that the decline in Asia-Pacific\u2019s first quarter pre-tax profit is explained primarily by higher structural cost. This reflects costs related to our plans to introduce 18 new vehicles this year and to bring online new capacity with four new plans. We will see the volume and revenue benefits of these investments in the second half. For the full year, we continue to expect Asia-Pacific pre-tax profit to be higher than 2014 with the improvements occurring in the second half consistent with the launch timing of new capacity and products. Let\u2019s now discuss Ford Credit on Slide 19. Ford Credit is a strategic asset that provides world class financial services to our dealers and customers and is an integral part of our global growth and value creation strategy that maintains a strong balance sheet that provides solid profits and distributions to Ford. In the first quarter, Ford Credit continues to demonstrate solid growth supporting Ford, including the launch of operations in India. Origination practices continue to be consistent and cost remained well-controlled and in line with expectations. In the quarter, Ford Credit\u2019s pre-tax profit was largely unchanged from a year ago. Favorable volume and mix primarily reflects higher consumer finance receivables globally and an increase in leasing in North America. Lower portfolio pricing drove the lower financing margin and the higher credit losses primarily reflect the non-repeat of reserve releases that occurred in the first quarter last year. As shown below the chart, favorable lease residual performance due to higher auction values in North America contributed to the higher pre-tax profit compared with fourth quarter 2014. For the full year, we continue to expect Ford Credit pre-tax profit to be equal to or higher than 2014 year end managed receivables to range from $123 billion to $128 billion and distributions to be about $250 million. We now expect managed leverage to be at the upper end of our range of 8 to 9 to 1 in the near term, because of the translation impact of the strong U.S. dollar. Next on Slide 20 is our automotive gross cash and operating related cash flow. Automotive gross cash at the end of the quarter was $19.5 billion. That was a decrease of $2.2 billion from the end of the fourth quarter. Automotive operating related cash flow was positive $500 million driven by our automotive pre-tax profit. In the first quarter, we had higher than normal levels of non-operating related cash outflows associated with separation payments, the one-time payment from us is the interest in AAI, which is our former joint venture assembly plant in Michigan, debt repayments and pension contributions. For the balance of the year, AAI will not repeat and quarterly cash outflows related to separation and debt payments and pension contributions will be on average much lower. Debt repayments in the quarter totaled $600 million and we made pension contributions of $800 million to our funded pension plans. We continue to expect contributions to funded plans for the full year to total $1.1 billion. We also made dividend payments of $600 million during the quarter. Slide 21 shows that our automotive debt was $13.4 billion at the end of the quarter, $400 million lower than fourth quarter. We had maturities in Europe and Asia-Pacific and continued to pay down U.S. Department of Energy loans. These reductions were offset partially by the consolidation of Ford Sollers external debt. We ended the quarter with net cash of $6.1 billion and automotive liquidity of $30.2 billion. Although not yet included in our total liquidity, we are in the process of amending and extending our corporate revolving credit facility. The facility, which is presently $12.2 billion, is expected to grow to $13.4 billion. The increase in the facility will be almost entirely allocated to Ford Credit to support its growth and liquidity plans. And with that, this concludes our review of the financial details of our first quarter earnings. So, I would like to turn it back to Mark. He is going to take us to our outlook for the 2015 business environment, as well as our planning assumptions and key metrics. Mark? Mark Fields : Okay, thanks a lot, Bob. So, let\u2019s start on Slide 22 with our view of the business environment and we do expect this year to be a year of growth globally with GDP expanding in about the 3% range. And this will be driven by the U.S., China, although at levels lower than in years past and improved growth in the euro area, in particular, with the UK continuing to perform at a higher level versus the rest of the continent. The main areas of concern continue to be in South America, which as Bob mentioned continues to face difficulties and also Russia. We also expect the strong U.S. dollar and the weak commodity prices, including oil to continue throughout the balance of the year. So, all-in-all, we see conditions as still being supportive of modest growth in the global auto industry in 2015. So, let\u2019s turn to our total company guidance, which you can see on Slide 23. And as both Bob and I have said, we do expect this year to be a very strong one for Ford Motor Company. In terms of industry sales outlook, we are raising our guidance for Europe 20, while we are trimming it back a bit in China. And industry sales here in the U.S. still look to be on track to be between 17 million and 17.5 million units. All of our other financial guidance at the company level remains on track to what we said back in January. And we said we were going to see growth in automotive revenue compared with 2014, a higher automotive operating margin, higher positive operating cash flow, equal to higher results at Ford Credit, and a company pre-tax profit of between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion. So, we feel good about our first quarter results and believe that they have us on track for the breakthrough year that we expect 2015 to be. And then, just to sum up on Slide 24, our plan and our priorities as a company remain unchanged and we remain on track to deliver our near and long-term objectives that we have laid out. And across Ford, we are accelerating the pace of our ONE Ford plan. We are delivering product excellence with passion and we are driving innovation into every part of our business. And all of this is supported by a day-in and day-out relentless execution on the operational fundamentals of our business. And I think nothing brings this to life better than the achievement by the Ford team in successfully launching the all-new F-150. And as we sit here today, the launches of our Dearborn and Kansas City plants are complete and we will reach full production during the balance of the second quarter. And earlier this month, the all-new F-150 SuperCrew, the SuperCab and the Regular Cab, all earned the U.S. government\u2019s highest possible crash safety rating. And I think that adds to the F-150 strengths as the toughest, smartest and most capable F-150 that we have ever produced. And on top of that achievement, outside experts also project that the F-150 residual values will be higher than not only our outgoing model, but also well above those of our highest volume competitors. Looking at customer reception, well, I have to tell you the customer reception to the product has been simply outstanding. And it\u2019s now clear that the bottom line contribution to our business from F-150 will be even stronger than we had originally expected. So, I think successes like this give us confidence in our five long-term objectives, which include being in the top five in global sales, creating a better balance of profitability and sales around the world, achieving 8% plus operating margins, being in the top quartile in total shareholder returns, and importantly, remain highly regarded by all of our stakeholders. So, we have the right strategic framework. I think we have the right proven operating process. And of course, I think we have the right team to deliver this, because Ford is a growth company in a global growing industry. And we are a proven innovator. In a period and a time here in the industry we are seeing rapid technological advancement than we have ever seen before. And we are operating the business for today, but also we are pushing ourselves to think and act and disrupt like a startup company anticipating customers\u2019 wants and needs 10 and 15 years down the road. And both are absolutely core to our plan for profitable growth. So, with that, why don\u2019t we open up the phone line for your questions? So, George? George Sharp : Thanks Mark. Now, we will open the lines for about a 45-minute Q&A session. As usual, we will begin with questions from the investment community then take questions from the media. Now in order to allow for as many participants as possible within this framework please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two. Mark, can we have the first question? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : Good morning guys and thanks for the new press release format, it\u2019s actually incredibly helpful. Mark Fields : Thanks, John. John Murphy : First question, just on North America, if we think about what\u2019s going on in the first half, it\u2019s understandable that margins are a bit depressed and it\u2019s certainly understandable that the bounce backup in the second half of the year, but it looks like the second half would be somewhere in the ballpark of 11% plus or minus, is there anything that\u2019s happening in the second half of the year other than these two launches that abnormal that would inflate these margins, I am just trying to understand which part of the year is more representative of what we should be thinking about for margins going forward in North America? Mark Fields : Well, I think as you think about is there anything abnormal, no. I think as we talked about in the first quarter you heard Bob\u2019s comments around the \u2013 their wholesale reductions that we have seen in F-Series and Edge. And as we get into the second half of the year, I think we are seeing great, really good acceptance to our new products, not only F-150, but Mustang, Transit. The Edge is still very early days, but it\u2019s off to a great start and we have the Explorer coming. So I think barring any kind of external shock, if you will to the economy, what you will see us is running at kind of regular production rates. And John, to put that into perspective on margin, as we mentioned it\u2019s very clear now that we are through the launch, mostly through the launch of the F-150 with a little bit of the acceleration, the final acceleration curve in the balance of the second quarter. It\u2019s clear we are seeing higher revenues. We are seeing likely a richer mix, lower cost. And I think that\u2019s than we originally expected as we launched last year. So we are growing the top line, which is allowing us to grow the bottom line. And if you look at the first quarter, if we ran at the kind of regular production rates, so if F-Series and Edge, we would have seen a margin of 10% or a bit above in the \u2013 in North America, so I think that\u2019s our expectation as going forward. And that\u2019s why we raised the overall guidance for the business unit. Bob Shanks : And John what we also are seeing is the launch effects are largely in the first quarter, somewhat in the second quarter. There is not as much of an effect of launches in the second half of the year, which maybe is a little bit unusual. But that\u2019s what you are seeing occur this year. We actually have a similar effect that\u2019s taking place in the case of Asia Pacific where we have had a lot of costs in place right now to support the plants that we will be opening around mid-year, which will bring with them new product and new volume, new revenue, new capacity. So a very similar story in both markets in terms of the second half versus first half. John Murphy : Okay. And then if I can just ask a second question around Europe, I am just curious as you look at the commitment to Russia, it\u2019s different than what you are seeing from one of your other big competitors out there. And I am just curious what you are seeing in Russia that you think is different, is it a function of the potential growth in the market, your relationship with Sollers, product cadence, I am just trying to understand what\u2019s different there. And also, as we think about that and in Europe in total, it looks like your second half should be better in Europe, much better than it does in the first half. And the first half looks like it\u2019s running pretty well as well, so I am just trying to understand the cadence in Europe as well? Mark Fields : Well, John I will take the question on Russia and Bob may be you can take the question on general Europe. But essentially, what we see in Russia is it\u2019s a big and important market. Even at its reduced rate right now, it still is going to be one of the bigger markets in Europe. And we still hold the view that when the market stabilizes and ultimately recovers that this could be the \u2013 one of the biggest, if not the biggest market in Europe. And it\u2019s important for us to be there. At the same time, we have been making a lot of progress on our presence there, obviously the joint venture with Sollers and we have invested as you know over the last couple of years where by the time we get to the balance of this year we are going to have a full lineup of vehicles that are localized for Russian customers. And although the market is difficult right now, everybody knows how difficult it is, I think we have done a good job in localizing our products. As we closed last year, we were probably about 40% localized and obviously, that's going to increase going forward. 99% of our sales in Russia are for vehicles that are actually produced in Russia. So when we look at the market environment, when we look at what we have done in terms of our product portfolio, in terms of localization. And to your point John, I think we have a very good working relationship with Ford Sollers, where we are both very dedicated to making sure that this business not only develops and succeeds. I think we are going to be very well positioned for future growth in Russia when we start seeing stabilization and ultimate growth. And that will have not only benefits for Russia, but also benefits for our European business. Bob, do you want to just talk about Europe? Bob Shanks : Yes, in terms, I know what you might expect in Europe. Normally, John the second half is worse than the first half and that\u2019s largely around the flat that you have got the plant shutdowns in the third quarter for about a month and then you have got the usual seasonal effect on the costs in the fourth quarter. I think this year, it could be mitigated just a little bit because we do have a number of significant products that are in the process of being launched or we will launch in the balance of the year and that will include the S-MAX, the Galaxy, the C-MAX, the Grand C-MAX are coming onboard. We have also got, I think the Mustang comes later this year, small volume Edge I think launch towards the end of the year. So it might be a little bit different. But I think you are probably going to see probably a little bit of worst performance in the second half versus the first half and that\u2019s just normal seasonal results there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please proceed. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just following up on Europe, can you help us quantify the impact of the Stollers consolidation when we think about it quarter-over-quarter on a pre-tax basis what kind of headwind will that be? Bob Shanks : When you think about the Russian operations, the effects that we have been reporting all along up until I think the second \u2013 after the second quarter of last year when we wrote off the equity in Sollers, it isn\u2019t just the Ford-Sollers JV, but we ship components there, we ship parts there, we are incurring engineering expense on behalf of Ford-Sollers for which we were receiving royalties. So now that we are fully consolidating, of course all of that just becomes intercompany, if you will. So while there will be some impact, I don\u2019t think it probably is going to be quite as great as you might thing because there was a lot of effect that was already in our consolidated operations before we picked up the JV. So you will just be picking up sort of the end market JV results. We do expect and I think we have talked about this already, Colin that we will have a greater drag on the business this year from total Russian operations than what we saw last year. But the good news is, I think with the change in terms of how we are going to work together, we are going to be able to move very quickly. Now, we have got a lot of new products that are coming. I think the last one is Fiesta, which is going to be a significant product for the marketplace. It\u2019s really encouraging that some aspects of what have been very variable factors, like the ruble, at least for the moment appear to have somewhat stabilized and actually are settling at a rate that\u2019s quite a bit better than what it was at the beginning of the year, which will help. So I think overall, we still feel like we are pretty much on track with what we had expected at the beginning of the year and already continuing in terms of our guidance for the European loss. Colin Langan : And my second question, any color on South America in terms of how we should think about the cadence throughout rest of the year, any reason to think things are going to get worse or is this if you \u2013 is Q1 actually a more difficult start? Mark Fields : Well, again it\u2019s a great question, Colin on what the crystal ball looks like. I think from our standpoint as you know we are changing the guidance based on the deterioration that we have seen in the external environment. And I think we are just going to stay focused on the things that we can control. And obviously, that\u2019s continuing to put fresh products into the marketplace. Bob mentioned some of the market share gains that we have had. We are also in that very important market. The team is energized around as you can imagine further reducing costs, looking at more localization, looking at optimizing our footprint, those types of things. So as we go through the balance of the year, we will deal with the external environment. But stepping back, we do expect South America, it\u2019s an important and attractive market as it has been in the previous decade. And we do expect it to be a positive contributor to our profits in the future, but the timing to the profitability to be quite honest is going to be based again on the stabilization of the market, but also ultimately some improvement in the external environment. Colin Langan : Alright, thank you very much. Mark Fields : Thanks, Colin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA. Please proceed. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi, good morning everybody. Mark Fields : Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner : Wanted to drill down a little bit on your net pricing in the North America on Slide 11, we saw some real encouraging sign on the gross pricing front with both pricing incentives netting $650 million or so, but a lot of it seems to be offset by your material, excluding commodity. So, was there anything specific in the material performance this quarter or would you expect essentially material to become essentially a large headwind as a result of the new product that\u2019s coming out? Bob Shanks : Thanks, Emmanuel. Yes, that\u2019s a really good question. I am looking at Slide 11 here in front of me. And for those of you that have the slides if you could refer to that, because I think if you look at that picture and you just imagine on the volume and mix, which is pretty flat here, you imagine that being very, very strong. I mean, that\u2019s what the year is going to look like. You are going to have a lot of strong positive growth on the top line mix as well. You are going to have very strong net pricing around the new product, but you are going to have higher cost, both contribution cost and structural cost and that\u2019s what we talked about at the beginning of the year. That\u2019s exactly the picture that we painted for North America, but that\u2019s going to yield the very strong margins that Mark referred to in the balance of the year, which is going to give us that 8.5% to 9.5%. So, given a 6%, 7% in the quarter, that\u2019s sort of \u2013 you can back into what that means for the balance of the year. We are going to have very strong margins, but that\u2019s the picture of what the business will look like. Emmanuel Rosner : And just to clarify this, so right now, the pricing in material sort of like offset each other. So, I understand obviously, the pricing will become a larger benefit as your volumes ramp up. Would it still be \u2013 would you still expect it to be offset by increasing materials or are saying that materials increases is the magnitude that we are seeing this quarter, but pricing is upside? Bob Shanks : Well, I think you will see stronger pricing, but I think what you have to look at is the pricing and the volume together as well as the mix. It\u2019s not just one or the other, it\u2019s those two, the first two bars there, which is volume, mix and pricing, you have to think about them all together, because the product is going to drive volume, the product is going to drive better mix. And then of course we are also going to get the pricing. So, all of those things together are going to drive the top line. And then the partial offset to that is going to be both the investments that we are making in the business on the structural or the fixed side and then of course the contribution cost, which is driven by the product cost that we are putting in. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, that\u2019s very clear. One last one on China, you are mentioning slowing gross that you saw during the quarter, was that a comment about the industry or about Ford specifically? And then coming with the slowing growth, are you seeing some pricing pressure as well? Mark Fields : Well, when you look at, you step back and you look at our performance in the first quarter, the industry was up about 3% and we were up a little over 9%, so almost triple that, but as you step back and look at the economy and we were just there obviously last week for the Shanghai Motor Show and spent the balance of the week there, we expect the economy, as we mentioned earlier, to be growing in about the 7% range. But you are seeing it obviously down from previous years, because you are seeing less demand for exports, but you are also seeing the shift from economy that has relied on growth through industry and investment to one that\u2019s shifting towards more service oriented and consumer led economy. So, I think that\u2019s having some ramifications in there. And as you can expect, you are seeing a different play out in different regions around the country. For example, in Chongqing, where our headquarters is, I think the GDP growth there was about 10% last quarter and obviously less than other regions. We are seeing the industry as you saw from our guidance. We kept it down a bit. So, we expect some modest growth, but we are seeing signs of some slower growth. And you are seeing it in B and C segments, some of the smaller segments, as it gets more competitive there. And then also, we are seeing a bit of shift as customers look at small SUVs. The pricing, to your point, actually, pricing has \u2013 net pricing has been negative for a number of years in the marketplace. We have baked that into our plan. And our pricing has been less negative because of the products that we have been introducing. So, our first quarter performance is encouraging for us as we stand back. I mentioned our share was even with the year ago, which was a record. It was actually up a bit from the fourth quarter as we have introduced products like the Escort. We have seen in general the Western OEMs in the first quarter as a group their share drop. We have held our share. Our new Escort is doing well. We have moved up in the passenger car rankings from number eight to number five in the quarter. And even, not forgetting our JMC business, which is our commercial business that they have had their best share ever and it was up significantly from last year. So, regardless of the industry situation we are seeing, I think we are well positioned in terms of whatever the market throws at us, because new products like the Edge and Everest, which are in the SUV category, which is an important growing category. Even in the C segment, which as I mentioned, is getting more competitive, the best kind of elixir for that is having fresh product. And we have introduced our Escort. Our new Focus is coming around mid-year. And of course, other products, like our Focus SD and the products that are launching now and going into new segments, like the Taurus, which will be coming in later this year, which is an important segment there. So overall, stepping back, it is slowing. We are seeing more pricing pressure in some segments. But I think we have a lot of confidence in our future there, because I think we have a strong product portfolio. We are expanding our manufacturing presence. Obviously, we are growing our jobs in the country due to our growth. We are marrying that to expanding our distribution network and we are growing our market share. And we also have a very good working relationship with our partner. So as we step back and we look at the year, we do expect a strong year. Second quarter, as Bob mentioned earlier, we have launched a number of our plants, like in India in our Hangzhou plant, we have \u2013 we really won\u2019t significantly start producing product out of that until the second half. So, you may see a business in Asia-Pacific that\u2019s about breakeven for the second quarter, but I think we are well-positioned for the balance of the year, but we will watch the market closely and we will follow our process, which if we see the market slowing down, we will match production to demand and take appropriate actions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache : Good morning, everybody. I wanted to follow-up, first of all, on the Asia-Pacific question. You had obviously some cost headwinds in China and India as you have had in the earnings growth with China equity earnings up like 2% on volume, that\u2019s up 10%. Could you just give us a sense of the magnitude of the headwinds that go away in China and India as you look out for the back half? And a question on pricing trajectory there, there has obviously been some mix commentary from some of the Germans. What\u2019s the \u2013 at a high level maybe an industry level, what do you see as the trajectory of price deflation there compared to prior years? Bob Shanks : Well, I will take a shot. And if Mark wants to supplement, he can. I want to go back and use the same approach I did on North America, because it\u2019s simple and I think it portrays what we are seeing. If you look at Slide 18 which is the Asia-Pacific slide, what is really unusual when you look at this slide versus what we have seen in prior quarters is you normally would see a really big positive bar on volume and mix. And you can see it\u2019s actually flat. So, we have seen negative net pricing as Mark said for quite a period of time. As particularly China matures, there is increasing productivity, competition intensifies, prices have been declining. And as you said, we have modeled that into our future plans. And so it\u2019s consistent with what you are seeing here in the quarter. We have been putting cost in the business and that\u2019s to support our growing business, not only for current quarter, current year, but forward years as well. And in this particular quarter, you are seeing a little bit of bad news on exchange, but really not material. So really, what\u2019s missing Rod is the volume and mix, because we essentially were sort of flat for the quarter. And what we do think is going to change materially in the second half of the year with the new capacity coming on stream and the new products we would expect to see a very strong contribution in the volume and mix category. I think pricing will be helped by the new products, but I think some of the effects of the slowing industry that Mark talked about, plus the natural negative trend of pricing, particularly in China, probably is still going to be a play. And you will continue to see cost coming in the business as we move through the year. Although, I think it will start to mitigate when we get into the second half of the year on a year-over-year basis. Mark Fields : And I would just add, Rod as you look at the industry, I think some of the pricing pressure will be maybe more concentrated as I have mentioned in some of the small cars, B and C cars, because we are seeing a bit of the same phenomenon in China as we are in other parts of the world, this migration from passenger vehicles to small and medium-sized SUVs. So I think you will see it may be more pronounced in those segments. But again, as Bob mentioned the best thing to do is, make sure you have fresh product in that environment which we will and we will deal with that. And also stepping back, as you know the Chinese government is very conscious of the economic performance of the country. And I think they will be looking at that and hopefully implement measures that if they see a significant slowing, they will maybe take some actions. But nonetheless, I think that\u2019s kind of the area you might see some of the more pricing pressure. Rod Lache : And just to clarify, Bob are you suggesting that basically, the cost inflation is going to be similar going forward, but you are going to see the volume benefit associated with that, is that essentially what you are saying? Bob Shanks : Yes. Rod Lache : Okay. And then in Europe also a question on pricing, were you expecting pricing to be kind of in this ballpark, do you think that moderates as the market begins to improve and can you just refresh us kind of the bridge to breakeven from here? Bob Shanks : I am sorry, you are referring to? Rod Lache : The European\u2026 Bob Shanks : The European, yes. Well, let me talk about Asia Pacific first. I just want to underscore something that Mark said earlier, which is we do expect that we could see something around the breakeven in Asia Pacific in the second quarter. And that\u2019s really because, as we look and get closer to the launches of those plants and the products, their launch costs will start to become even more material than what they have been. So that will probably be the story around the second quarter. But when you get into the third and fourth quarter, you are exactly right. We are going to see our expectations are that you are going to see very strong top line growth that you are not seeing in this particular quarter because of the factors that we just mentioned. When you get to Europe, Europe is a challenging market. We have made a lot of progress with our transformation plan. I think the share improvement is very, very encouraging. And we are doing that with healthy share. We actually are under indexing in the short cycle segments rental and the demo sales. We are getting this the hard way. We are getting \u2013 with retail we are getting especially with commercial vehicles. I mentioned the number 2.8 points up, number one brand in Europe and not that long ago, we were what, number seven or something. I mean the improvement has been dramatic and the profitability of those segments is helpful as well. But we do have the impact of Russia. We talked about that being a material impact in terms of an absolute loss. We certainly are working very hard to improve that as we go forward. In the case of overall Europe, we are going to have to do more. While we are seeing the improvement in share in the particular quarter, we are talking about we have that impact on the stocks. I don\u2019t want to pass that by because that was a little unusual. We usually will grow stocks in the quarter because we are preparing for the spring selling season and then you have got the plants shutdown in the third quarter. We did not do that this quarter because we ended last year a little bit heavy on stocks. We have got ourselves in a really good position in terms of days supply we are at targeted levels as of the end of the quarter. But we did that by not building stocks if you will, in the quarter. So I want to make sure that you kind of pay attention to that when you look at that callout box on the variance slide for Europe because that was about $144 million. So that was a bit unusual. But as we go forward, we are going to have to continue to work the top line. We are going to have to continue to drive for greater share. We are going to have to work on the pricing. One thing I do want to underscore again in the quarter, that negative pricing you have to kind of look at the exchange good news because it was somewhat related in part because of the what went on in Switzerland and the UK and the strength of those currencies relative to the euro. But it\u2019s really around cost, we are going to have to take more costs out of the business and work on Russia in order for the business to continue to march towards profitability. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed. Brian Johnson : Yes. Good morning. Mark Fields : Good morning. Brian Johnson : I want to return to North America, but talk more about the dynamics in the car market and how those might have progressed over the year and actually since you gave the Investor Day update, kind of specifically, you eliminated a shift for small or mid car where \u2013 for small car, where are small and mid-cars shaping up both in terms of volume and in terms of pricing environment and maybe as well as fleet dynamics versus what you thought and within your 50 basis point margin increase, are you actually contemplating a headwind from cars versus what you might have thought in the fall offset perhaps by the F-150? Mark Fields : Well, I think if you step back and you look at the car market, the highest level when you look at the industry, Brian you can see that the industry has \u2013 on a percentage basis has increased on trucks and decreased on passenger vehicles. And we have seen that pronounced obviously, in the C-car segment. And the C-car segment last year this quarter was about 20% of the industry. It\u2019s now about 18.5%. So it\u2019s down. Our share of Focus is about flat within that. But because of that reduction, that\u2019s why we took the shift off. And so on the car side as \u2013 and we talked about in this back in January. We saw that shift and we expected and we factored into our plan a more aggressive, if you will environment on that, particularly given our competitors in terms of some of the products that they ship into the country here. And I think we will see it continue to be competitive going forward. The good news for us is as we see that shift into trucks and utilities, that\u2019s the benefit for us because of our profitability on those vehicles. Brian Johnson : Okay. And I guess somewhat related, you mentioned kind of the Asians in the content, we had an announcement from Toyota prior - over the last \u2013 prior to New York auto show that they would be rolling out ADAS at about a $300 mass market price point, $500 mid and large car price point. How does that kind of affect your thinking, vis-\u00e0-vis, A, kind of when you might bring ADAS into the U.S. aggressively versus just Europe where it\u2019s now rewarded by NCAP and kind of be how that factors into your option mix and pricing on the option mix? Mark Fields : Well, stepping back as you know, we have been a leader in a lot of the technologies in the semi-autonomous technologies as well as the safety technologies, which are really propagated throughout our vehicle lineup depending upon the vehicle. And so I think we have been a leader in that regard. Clearly, we have seen some announcements from some of our competitors, namely you did mention Toyota in terms of price points. Obviously, as you know, we always look at our vehicle lines. We also do a lot of analysis on our competitiveness. So we will factor that in into our plans going forward. But stepping back, we have had a big commitment to technology and smart technology and delivering it in a way that provides value for customers, but also makes it available to millions of folks. So you will continue to see us do on that going forward. Brian Johnson : And do you think the pace of that\u2019s increasing versus maybe where you would have been late last summer, early fall? Mark Fields : Well, the pace has gone very fast, but I think we factored that in. When you look at our, for example, the type of technology, ADAS or otherwise that we have even on our vehicles like our Focus, I mean we have been anticipating that. But clearly, customers are saying that\u2019s very important to them. And I think that was just reiterated in our recent survey last week I read \u2013 I can\u2019t remember who did it. That said the most \u2013 technology, the most important to customers are around safety and around collision avoidance and things of that nature. And we have factored that in and have been implementing that. Brian Johnson : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please proceed. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thank you. Good morning everyone. Mark Fields : Good morning, Itay. Itay Michaeli : Just two big picture question maybe starting off with Europe, I think you alluded to it a little bit before, but as we think about an eventual path to the breakeven in profitability, any updated thoughts about what you would view in terms of market conditions mainly a breakeven point in terms of volume to kind of help us model that out a little bit better over the next couple of years? Mark Fields : Well, not really, I mean, I think one of the things that\u2019s going to be important in terms of getting to breakeven and ultimately profitability in Europe is the \u2013 not only the industry size, which clearly the larger the better. We have seen some growth, but obviously, we would like to see more, but it\u2019s the pricing environment as well. That\u2019s so important. As Bob mentioned, when you look at the pricing environment in Europe, we have had a specific strategy to improve our channel mix, which I think we have made a lot of coverage. And as Bob mentioned, we actually over-index versus the competitors on retails and fleet business versus the daily rental and self registrations, but it\u2019s still a market where in any given day, the industry discounts 20% or more across their vehicle lineup. And I think from our standpoint, our strategy is, as we mentioned earlier, is bringing out compelling product, working that channel mix so that we get the growth, but that it\u2019s profitable growth. And what we saw even in the last month or two, as Bob mentioned in the UK, we have seen some of our competitors really take advantage of the strong pound in the case of Switzerland, the strong franc, and get very competitive. And we are not going to do that. We are going to manage for margin and for profit. Itay Michaeli : Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And maybe in a similar tone around the consolidated Asia operations, it looks like you are probably running a couple $100 million loss there. That of course should improve second half of the year with the volume ramp in India. And of course, you have the exit of Australia in the next couple of years. Anything else you can do to kind of improve results there? And maybe a timeline to get that region back to profitability kind of what has to happen there? Bob Shanks : Yes, I think on that one if you look at the quarter and the change year-over-year, the thing that\u2019s interesting, we forget when we show the JV profitability, there is a bigger China profitability. So, I will tell you the joint ventures. And we have talked about this on our Investor Day or rather Ford University day, we have got the Lincoln business, which is fully consolidated. We are incurring engineering inside Ford that is only paid for years later through royalty rates once the products are in production. We have got central staff costs, if you will, for our operations and so forth. And of course, if I didn\u2019t mention it because I am forgetting, it could be a Lincoln of the investments for Lincoln. So, when you look at all of those costs outside of the joint ventures inside China, those are actually the biggest factor in terms of the change year-over-year and profitability outside the joint ventures. Those costs are actually up and a lot of that is driven by the investments for Lincoln, but also for the imported Ford vehicles that go into the market. Many of those are in balance out as we think are ready for transition to new products. And so there is an effect on that. So, that\u2019s actually, Itay, having the biggest effect year-over-year outside the JVs. Australia is down a little bit, but that\u2019s mostly related to the Australian dollar. Going ahead, we have had a really long-term view around India and around ASEAN, particularly Thailand. We are investing in these operations to expand our position domestically, but we are also positioning these vehicles or these markets to be global export hubs. So, I would expect once these operations and this is I am talking now publicly 2 or 3 years down the road, particularly if you bring in Thailand, it\u2019s going to be several years before we get these things to the point where they are really humming both in terms of domestic contribution, but also the export contribution as well. We have got \u2013 so I would look at that as more medium term. I agree with you on Australia. Once we get past the closure of the plant in October of 2016, we should see a significant turnaround there. Operator : Your next question comes from Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Mark Fields : Hello. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my question. What\u2019s your latest thinking relative to commodities for the full year? I think it was called out on Slide 7 as a $39 million positive. I think it\u2019s pretty small in the context of your business. Should we expect it to turn more material as the year progresses? Bob Shanks : Yes, we think it will improve as the year progresses and probably have a bigger impact in second half than in the first half. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. And then just my second question on the North America profit bridge, can you help us think about the higher cost in the quarter contribution and structural? How much of them are temporary versus permanent? So, for example, relative for material ex-commodity, I think that\u2019s more permanent right, the higher content and the cars, but then in the structural bucket that some of the manufacturing engineering headwinds relate more to launch costs that then subside? And advertising too was that primarily F-150 and then we can expect it to settle some? Bob Shanks : Well, I think you will continue to see increases in our structural cost, because while these launch costs will go away or these advertising or sales promotion costs will go away for these particular products, we will have new ones coming along as well. But it is true in the quarter we do have some substantial launch cost and we are starting to see advertising sales promotion expense pickup for the new products as well, but I think it\u2019s probably unfair to say that, that\u2019s one-time cost. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Joe Spak : Thanks. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to tie together some of the things you talked about as we think further out in North America. So, clearly, price mix is going to be strong here. You talked about some of the costs, either temporary or otherwise, this year. And then you also mentioned you are considering that you are going to have to add content going forward to remain competitive at what seems like could be increasingly difficult to price for? So, I guess I am just wondering if we think about your longer term target, it seems like there does have to be another built-in cost offset? And how do we think about that? I mean, are you targeting a certain amount of basis points over a year in terms of just general or other material savings? I mean, how do we get comfort that add someone more pressures enter the system the margins are sustainable? Bob Shanks : Well, we do have specific targets around North America to make an operating margin of 9 to \u2013 8 \u2013 I am sorry, I forgot, 8% to 10%. Mark Fields : 8% to 10%. Bob Shanks : I prefer the higher number. Mark Fields : I know. Bob Shanks : 8% to 10%. And I think this year we are looking very good in terms of that range. As we go forward, I think the biggest concern we have is around regulatory costs are coming at us, because consumers have shown that they are not willing to pay for that. So, we are going to have to really put a lot of focus on the cost side of the business. We do generate good cost reductions and working with our supply base. We are going to have to generate, I think incremental efficiencies, both looking at structural cost. And there is a lot of opportunities I think in that area for us going forward. But the other thing that I would expect to have, because I have seen over the course of my career is you will see a lot of these new technologies, you will see efficiencies going down the technology curve. As volume increases, it becomes more \u2013 the volumes increase across the industry and we just \u2013 the industry finds ways to produce these types of technologies to lower cost. If you go back to the 80s and think about how expensive ABS was and when we are looking at times when competitors were starting to spread them our standard across vehicles and we are having our hard text to help out, because how expensive they were, we don\u2019t even think about that today, because the costs are so low, that\u2019s occurred over time. So, I think that will be another factor, Joe, that will come to play across the whole industry, not just for us. Mark Fields : And Joe, one more factor is, as we work on the cost side, we shouldn\u2019t forget obviously the revenue side, that\u2019s just having compelling product. I mean, when you look at vehicles like our Mustang vehicles, like the Transit, what we are reporting out on F-150. When you can have a compelling product either from a functional or a design standpoint, you can get good revenue for that. So, we have to work both. We have to work the top line and we have to work the cost to make sure that we have a business that is earning more than appropriate return for us. Joe Spak : Okay. And then you mentioned the strong residual values on the F-150, which we noticed as well. Is there any stat you can give us on maybe \u2013 I know it\u2019s early, but maybe sort of leasing mix or penetration on the new truck versus what it\u2019s been historically? And then I guess, while we are on the topic of residuals, any \u2013 are you starting to mark residual values on leases broadly a little bit lower as maybe like things like used volumes start to pickup over the coming years? Mark Fields : No, just in the first part of your question, it\u2019s really too early to tell, too early days on the question you are asking around leasing and percentages and by region etcetera, but we will provide more color on that as we get more into the launch. Bob Shanks : Yes, the only thing I would add on that is that F-150 tends not to be a heavy leased vehicle. So, that\u2019s really not such a factor in terms of the sales of F-150. But we are seeing good auction values. That was actually one of the favorable things that we talked about in our results today. So, I think the team has done a really, really good job of managing our leasing portfolio. We are very careful and cautious in terms of the concentration of lease, both geographically by vehicle line, by series. So we have learned a lot of lessons over the last number of years and we have got a lot of data analytics behind our leasing strategies to make sure that we don\u2019t go too deep in any particular part of the business to put those values at risk. Operator : At this time we will be taking question from the media. [Operator Instructions] Your first question from the media comes from John Stoll from Wall Street Journal. Please proceed. John Stoll from Wall Street Journal, please proceed. John Stoll : Hey guys, sorry about that. The press release was good. A quick question on costs and I know that there has been a lot of emphasis on this already, but just that kind of demo down a bit more. So when you look at the cost increase in North America ex-material in the first quarter, I am just trying to understand that very simply, the run rate versus what you can price for and then Bob you had mentioned regulatory costs, how much of this cannot be absorbed in pricing and is just, you guys have to eat it and how much of this can be and will be absorbed by the consumer in this environment and how long will the consumer be willing to basically pay more and at what point do you see a bit more pressure on pricing in the future? Bob Shanks : Yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as what you are portraying it. And I do understand what you are talking about. I don\u2019t think you can separate the investments you make and delivering and providing customers really strong product, which is what Mark talked about, in terms of what that gives you with volume, what it gives you in terms of mix, as well as the opportunity to price for it. You really have to look at the all those factors together, John. And I know you know that, but you have to look at them altogether and understanding are you getting the appropriate sort of total revenue for that particular investment against those costs that you have put in as well. And I think, as you will see going forward in the year, in North America you are going to see a cost increase, it\u2019s what we have talked about. And we do expect that going forward in the subsequent quarters, but you are going to see very, very strong top line growth both in terms of what\u2019s driven by volume, what\u2019s coming from mix and also what\u2019s coming from of that pricing. So you really got to look at all of them together to understand whether or not you have got a good equation. And with the margins that we are talking about, it\u2019s very, very clear that the North American business, the balance of all of those things together is actually giving us a very, very strong business. John Stoll : And how much of the pricing power that you have right now is related to the cadence that you guys have been on, I mean just the investments in product over product and the changeover, how much of this is just organic and kind of secular environment where nobody else is really, I mean not many of your competitors are being extremely reckless on incentives right now the atmosphere is actually pretty tight, so how much of this is industry and how much of this is Ford specific. And again, what is the sustainably of that \u2013 of those trends? Bob Shanks : Yes. It\u2019s actually a combination of both. This is not all strictly equipment related pricing. You are also seeing what we would call pure pricing that\u2019s occurring. And of course we are very observant and careful about where we are standing competitively. We have seen continued discipline as you said in the overall industry. We are seeing price increases coming from a number of our other competitors. So the overall environment, I think is a very healthy one. I think in general, competitors are doing a reasonably good job of matching their production to demand and that certainly is providing an overall lift, I think, for the entire industry. Mark Fields : And then to your point \u2013 John, to your point about what is our plan going forward I mean our plan going forward as you know is to keep our product pipeline full. And as Bob mentioned, a good portion of the pricing is based on the new product also that we have out there. And by any third party external studies that\u2019s done on the industry, you can see that we plan on keeping that product pipeline absolutely full and that will be a big element in allowing us to price appropriately going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Dee-Ann Durbin from Associated Press. Dee- Ann Durbin : Hi, thanks for taking the call. GM said last week the strong dollar cost it about almost $2 billion in revenue in the first quarter they weren\u2019t the only ones talking about it, Facebook has been talking about it, Pepsi, does Ford have any sort of similar calculation on the impact of the dollar in the quarter? Bob Shanks : Yes. Dee-Ann that\u2019s a good question, we had a decline in our revenue of $2 billion in the quarter, 70% of that was directly related to exchange. I think the thing that\u2019s very interesting though is while that did impact the top line, because it\u2019s simply translation of the strong dollar against the overseas operations revenue. When you look at the bottom line, we are actually seeing good news on exchange in the company. And a lot of that is around is non-repeat of the balance sheet effects that we saw last year in South America, but even as you strip that out, the effect of exchange on the bottom line in terms of profitability is pretty muted. Dee- Ann Durbin : Great, thank you. Operator : I would now like to hand you over to George Sharp for closing remarks. George Sharp : Okay, thanks, everyone. That wraps up today\u2019s presentation. We are really glad that you are able to join us. Operator : Thank you very much. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a great day.",

My name is Katina and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will facilitate a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. George Sharp, Executive Director, Ford Investor Relations. Please proceed. George Sharp : Thank you, Katina and good morning. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I would like to thank you for taking the time to be with us this morning, so we can provide you with additional details of our second quarter 2015 financial results. Copies of this morning\u2019s press release and presentation slides are available on Ford\u2019s investor and media websites. Now presenting today are Mark Fields, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, Corporate Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Mike Seneski, Ford Credit CFO. Also with us is Ted Cannis, who will be replacing me as head of Investor Relations effective next week. Today\u2019s presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford\u2019s future performance. Of course, actual results could be different. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation and of course detailed in our SEC filings. Finally, any non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent in the appendix of the slide deck. Our Form 10-Q is planned to be released later today. With that, I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mark. Mark Fields : Thanks, George. Good morning everybody. What I would like to do is start out within overview and then Bob will walk us through the slides. The headline is that we had an outstanding second quarter. If you look at some of the highlights, we had the best automotive quarterly profit since 2000; the best quarter ever in North America; a second quarter record in Asia Pacific; strong continued results at Ford Credit; we roughly broke even in Europe; and we\u2019re on track to deliver a breakthrough year that we talked about at the beginning of the year. As we rack up the numbers for the quarter, we achieved $2.9 billion in pre-tax profit, which is up 10% versus last year. Our net income was up 44% to $1.9 billion. Our operating margin, our automotive operating margin came in at 7.2%, which was up six-tenths of a point from last year. Our automotive operating related cash flow was a healthy $1.9 billion. Importantly our global market share grew for the second quarter in a row. Our wholesale volume was up. Now revenue was flat and that was due to the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on our international operations. And I would note that in the quarter we had no special items. As a matter of fact, in the first half, we had no special items in the company. Now as we go forward, we\u2019re going to stay very focused on our three priorities, and these drive all of our folks including myself every day we walk in the door and it\u2019s around accelerating the pace of progress of our One Ford plan; delivering product excellence with passion; and driving innovation in every part of our business. And I believe our results in this quarter show that the plan our people and our processes are delivering. If we look at the first half, we racked up $4.3 billion in profit and we expect a stronger second half. On the balance of the year, this year is in total remains very busy. We have 16 new vehicle launches. And I\u2019m happy to say 12 of them have been completed. And importantly, we\u2019re delivering on quality. And actually all regions across the globe are seeing strong progress on quality so far this year. And it\u2019s really encouraging for us to see third-party validate the progress that we\u2019re making on bringing great quality in our products for our customers. As we look at our business units, we expect particular strength in North America and that\u2019s because essentially we\u2019re benefitting from a full supply of new products like the F-150 and the Edge as well as Explorer. We now see the opportunity to be in the upper half of the 8.5% to 9.5% range in North American operating margin. Our new F-150 is a full production and customers love it. We\u2019ve also completed the launches for Ford Edge, Ford Explorer and Lincoln MKX. In Europe, we\u2019re equally busy. We\u2019ve had several new products launch in the first-half including the all new S-Max and the new Fiesta in Russia. And in Asia Pacific, we fulfilled our promise of 10 new plants with the 10th plant opening during the second quarter. Now the balance of the year, we have four more new global vehicles to launch and they are all on track and it includes the Everest full-size SUV and the Taurus sedan in Asia and the F series medium duty truck which is going to be built in Ohio and the Mustang GT350, which will be built in our Flat Rock plant in Michigan. And speaking of our products, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the customer reaction that we\u2019re getting to our new products. In North America, the new F-150 is a smash hit; it has record transaction prices. And for those of you that saw that last week J.D. Power APEAL awards came out and the F-150 was the award winner for pickups. And also AutoPacific came out with their Vehicle Satisfaction Awards and the F-150 received the highest vehicle satisfaction ever for a full-size pickup. Our new Edge, well we had record sales in the second quarter; Explorer, in the second quarter, our sales were up 30%. In Europe, we\u2019re gaining market share and that\u2019s being led by transit. And as you know, we\u2019ve basically redone our entire Transit lineup in the last year. Our new Mondeo and also our SUVs are doing well. In Asia Pacific, Escort is the fastest growing nameplate in the segment and it competes in the Sales-segment. Mustang is already the best selling sports car from a volume brand in China. And down in South America, the Mondeo now leads the segment in Argentina. So while we\u2019re delivering today and staying very focused on that, we\u2019re also intensely focused on the future because we believe that we really are in a period of change and disruption in the industry unlike we have seen in many, many years. And you can see that it manifesting itself in car sharing and autonomous vehicles, connected cars, and new mobility solutions. And rather than seeing that as a threat, we see that as a huge opportunity as a company. And we\u2019re really encouraging our organization actually to disrupt our own business model and really take advantage of the spirit of innovation that we have at Ford, going all the way back to our founder Henry Ford. And our company vision is pretty simple : It\u2019s to make people\u2019s lives better. So, this is about nurturing our core business, but also embracing emerging businesses whether they be products or services. And earlier this year, we launched what we call Ford Smart Mobility. And this really is our plan to go to the next level in connectivity, mobility, autonomous vehicles, the customer experience and big data. And we launched 25 experiments earlier this year and now it\u2019s really exciting because we\u2019re moving now from experimentation to the start of implementation on a number of pilots. And I can assure you that as we go forward, we\u2019re going to share more details in the coming months about the progress that we\u2019re making. So stepping back, overall it was one of the strongest quarters in our recent history. It was a great first-half. The second half is going to be even better. And we\u2019re now more confident than ever that we\u2019ll deliver our breakthrough year. So with that, why don\u2019t I turn it over to Bob? Bob Shanks : Thanks, Mark. Just in terms of process first, I am just going to go through selected slides today, so I\u2019ll be calling out the slide numbers of the deck that was published. So, follow me that way. Let me provide a bit of context first, and I am on slide four. If you go back to the beginning of the year, we laid out a year that was going to start slower and build momentum into the second half which we expected to be the strongest of the year and then ultimately to a breakthrough year. And I have to tell you, based on the good start to the year that we had in the first quarter and what is clearly outstanding results for the company here in the second quarter, strong first-half, we are clearly on a path towards a breakthrough year which includes a good performance that will build on what we have done here in the first-half, something that we\u2019re really, really excited about. What I\u2019d like to do now is start going through the details. I won\u2019t touch on the details of this slide because Mark has touched on it. So, let\u2019s just dive right into the sector results here on slide five. So, if you look at the upper left, you can see that we earned $2.9 billion in the quarter for the company on an operating basis. We had no special items in the quarter. We were up 10% from a year ago, and this was a third best quarter of company operating performance since we came out of the great recession. On the slide, you can see the automotive results were strong at $2.4 billion and financial services at nearly $0.5 billion with Ford Credit itself just over $0.5 billion. So both sectors contributed to the performance; and as you can see below the chart, both contributed to the improvement compared with the second quarter a year ago and both contributed to stronger results compared with the first quarter. Automotive fairly was the big driver between the two segments but both were positive contributors. Let\u2019s go on now and look more deeply at the auto sector on slide six. Here are key metrics and if you start up on the upper right, you can see the $2.4 billion pretax profit in the quarter also up 10% and this was the best automotive profit that we have generated since 2000. Results were better than they were a year ago. They were also better than the prior quarter and in both instances, that improvement was due to favorable market factors. So that\u2019s volume, mix and net pricing. The margin was strong at 7.2%. We did deliver higher wholesales up about 2% that was North America and Europe. Revenue was about flat and this was inclusive of just over $2 billion of adverse currency effects from translation of local currencies, revenue currencies into U.S. dollars. If you look in the lower left, you can see the SAAR was down on a year-over-year basis about 0.5 million units; this was driven by Asia Pacific which includes China which we\u2019ll talk about later. South America was down as well as was Middle East and Africa. Our market share was up as Mark mentioned. For the second consecutive quarter, it was up a tenth to 7.6% and we saw improvements in South America and Europe and in Middle East and Africa. Let\u2019s now go to slide eight and let\u2019s look at the absolute of the sector in the quarter. Let\u2019s start with North America which clearly was a driver of the overall performance. It was North America\u2019s best ever quarterly profit. I\u2019ve probably said that five times and maybe six times if I can do it again. But it was a fantastic quarter for North America. It also drove the year-over-year improvement and the quarter-to-quarter improvement. But there is actually a lot of good things that are happening in the operations outside of North America as well. Let\u2019s look at them individually first. So, Asia Pacific had a record quarter for the profit. We did say potentially a breakeven result when we met with you last time but the team did a fantastic job of delivering a good cost performance in the quarter which generated the good results that we see today. And I want to call out Europe which even though was at about breakeven, there is a lot of positive things that we see both in external environment in Europe but also on our own performance that I\u2019ll touch on in just a minute. If you take these operations collectively, the ones outside North America, they approached breakeven. So letting the North American profits essentially flow through and they collectively improved versus the first quarter and also versus the year-over-year results second quarter of last year. So, very, very pleased with the performance across the board, the breadth of it as well as the depth of it, particularly in North America. Let\u2019s go on now and we\u2019ll start going through the business units on the next slide which is slide nine and this is North America. The North America consistently has been profitable since 2010. It\u2019s average to margin of over 9% and let\u2019s jump right to the margin. Here you can see just a fantastic result of 11.1% in the quarter. And I want to highlight that North America did not benefit from positive year-over-year performance from F-150. F-150 is fairly doing very well but it was still in launch phase during the second quarter; we only reached full production very late in the quarter. Wholesales were actually down 25,000 units on a year-over-year basis in the quarter. So, this performance was a very broad-based performance which is one of the things that we feel so excited about when we look at North America. If you look at the profit, we\u2019ve already talked about it being a record but I can do it once more, $2.6 billion; it was up year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter due to favorable market factors. Now, I\u2019m not going to go through slide 10 which is the details of the year-over-year but if you look at the pricing performance, kind of unusually; you\u2019ll see that we had higher pricing and that was not just F-150 that was across many products in the portfolio. We also have lower incentives. So, it was a very powerful quarter in terms of our pricing performance. Operating margin, I\u2019ve touched on. Let\u2019s go over and look at the top line. The top line was up; wholesales were up and that\u2019s despite the decline in F-150 that I mentioned. And in terms of revenue that was up as well. And that did include headwinds from exchange on the revenues that we earned in Canada and Mexico. Looking at SAAR; SAAR was up on a regional basis and in the U.S. share was down however and this was due to the launch effects of the F-150. It\u2019s not shown here but our retail of retail share of U.S. is actually up a tenth. In terms of the full year, we continue to expect our profits going to be better than it was last year. And as Mark mentioned, we clearly see the opportunity based on the first half performance to generate a return that\u2019s in the upper half of the 8.5% to 9.5%. Mark, any comments on that\u2026? Mark Fields : Yes. Let me just give some perspective on F-150 because obviously there is a lot of interest in it. First off, we are really excited and we\u2019re seeing strong demand for the new F-150. It\u2019s turning on our dealers\u2019 lots of more than twice as fast as the segment as a whole. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re seeing record transaction prices with lower incentives versus last year. The mix is rich. We talked about the third party awards that we were winning in that product. And more basically now, we are at full production at the plants and we expect to hit normal levels of inventory by the end of the third quarter. So, we could not be more pleased and confident where we are with the F-150. Bob Shanks : Yes. It\u2019s really a great performance and certainly something that\u2019s going to drive the performance in the second half. Mark Fields : Yes, absolutely. Bob Shanks : Okay, let\u2019s go on to the next region; we\u2019ll talk about South America on slide 11. So looking at South America, I mean the first thing you have to talk about is the external environment. It is very, very tough, particularly in Brazil. And we\u2019re not seeing any good signs from recent economic indicators, fiscal actions in Brazil have been taken to improve the economy longer term and that probably means more pain in the short-term. So, no signs at this point of reaching bottom. Our team is managing very, very well and very proactively in this environment and we believe that they\u2019re positioning our business for recovery, once it does occur. But again, no signs of a bottom and certainly we\u2019re not talking about a recovery today. But having said that, certainly our One Ford product strategy is paying off; we saw strong share growth in the region and in Brazil once again that was driven by the all new car, but we also saw the Fusion leading its segment once again in Brazil and we saw the F-Series and the Cargo leading the semi-light and the light segments; also proud to say that the Argentina -- in Argentina that the Ford brand was again number two there in terms of market share. The loss in the quarter was $185 million that was a pretty good improvement year-over-year that was due to higher net pricing. Two elements of that : One is the fact that we\u2019re recovering or trying to recover inflation which is very high in the region as well as the adverse operating exchange effects of the weak currencies but we did also see positive pricing from new product in particular, the car. The results were pretty much the same on a quarter-to-quarter basis. If we look at Wholesales that was down, that was due to the lower industries. And if we look at revenue that was down sharply as well, again due to lower industries but also exchange. In fact about two-thirds of the overall decline in revenue was due to the weaker local currencies. If we look at the full year, we continue to expect a loss but we expect that loss to be lower than what it was a year ago. Alright, let\u2019s go on and we\u2019ll go to slide 13 and we\u2019ll look at Europe. Actually feel quite encouraged by what we saw in Europe in the quarter. We approached breakeven which is about where were, a year ago, as you can see here. We did do better on a quarter-to-quarter basis and that was due to market factors. But let me talk about some things that we think indicate that there are some positive things going on here and certainly make us feel that we\u2019re on a good path towards profitability. If you look first at the external environment, we\u2019re seeing modest but good growth in the euro area, stronger growth in the UK in terms of GDP. If you look at industry sales, we\u2019re seeing growth in total Europe and that\u2019s despite big decline in Russia and we\u2019re seeing growth in Europe 20. Our wholesale volume is doing well, it\u2019s up in total. If you look at share, in terms of total Europe, it was up in the second quarter; it was also up in the first half which isn\u2019t shown here. If we look at Europe 20, it was flat in the quarter but it also was up in the first half. The revenue decline that was more than explained by exchange translation, so again on a local basis, we\u2019re seeing growth in revenue. There are a few other things that I just want to highlight in terms of the results for you to think about. If you look at slide 14, which we won\u2019t go to now, but you\u2019ll see in the callout box for volume and mix that we took a hit in the quarter of about $150 million from the fact that in the quarter, stocks only increased by 1,000 units. Normally in the second quarter in Europe for seasonal reasons, we\u2019ve got the plant shutdowns in the third quarter; they\u2019ll have a stock build, which is what we had last year. So, on a year-over-year basis, we\u2019re taking about $150 million hit in the quarter because we did not have that normal stock build. Several reasons for that, first of all, we had a pretty decent level of stock going into the quarter but during the quarter we had industry strikes in Turkey that affected our operations there, that limited the supply of transits back into our European operations and then very late in the quarter, we had launches of the all new S-Max and the Galaxy, which constrained supply of those products in the quarter. Another factor to think about is that in the quarter compared with the year ago, we had higher pension cost. These are lower discount rates that we saw at the end of last year that are increasing the amortization of losses related to our pension obligations in Europe. So, think of this as sort of a penalty for something that\u2019s already happened in the past; it\u2019s non-cash. The underlying run rate of the business is better. But I just wanted to call that out for your awareness. And then the last thing I guess, I\u2019d mention is a year ago -- we talked about it year ago, we did benefit from a onetime reserve release associated with our Cologne investment agreement, so that did not obviously occur this year and we still delivered about the breakeven result that you see today. So we feel that the European transformation plan is continuing to progress. We clearly have to push even further on brand, product and cost but we do feel that we\u2019re on track towards profitability. In terms of the full year, it\u2019s not going to happen this year. We still expect the loss; it will be better than it was a year ago. I will say that we do think the second half results will be worse than the first half and that is due to normal seasonal factors. So with that what I\u2019d like to do is turn to Mark to see if he\u2019s got any comments on Europe. Mark Fields : Yes, just some perspective on the market in Europe. We remain cautiously optimistic on the continued industry growth in the second half. If you look at the channel mix, it\u2019s fairly stable year-over-year. Commercial vehicles encouragingly are up more than passenger cars. And as you know that\u2019s a good indicator for where the economy is going. Pricing, we\u2019ve seen some modest improvement but incentives obviously still remain high. And it\u2019s interesting; we\u2019re seeing some trends in Europe that we saw during the North American recovery. In particular, we\u2019re seeing some pent-up demand, obviously not to the same degree, but some of that pent0up demand. And we\u2019re seeing a mix improvement. When customers are ordering their vehicles, they are ordering a more well-equipped and that\u2019s exactly what we saw here in North America and that\u2019s helped a bit of the pricing environment. So overall, we\u2019re seeing some green shoots, but still we know we got a lot of work to do. Bob Shanks : Let\u2019s go on and I\u2019ll talk about Middle East and Africa. This is our youngest and smallest business unit, I just want to remind everybody, this is a region that is 1.4 million consumers and it\u2019s growing about 4% or 5% a year. And we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re doing here and what the team is working on to establish a good position for us as this region begins to take off. In the quarter, results moved from the small profit last year to a small loss this year and this was driven by essentially production timing differences. Most of the volume that we actually sell in Middle East and Africa is sourced from other regions. So as a result, we\u2019ve got long order and lead-times since we\u2019re going to get volatility by quarterly results and certainly really that\u2019s what we saw this quarter. In terms of the full year, we continue to expect the results to be about breakeven. So, not a lot to talk about today on Middle East and Africa, but team is working hard to really position us for substantial growth here in the years ahead. Let\u2019s go on to slide 16 and we\u2019ll talk about Asia Pacific. So Asia Pacific, a lot of excitement here with record for the quarter, operating margin of nearly 8% and this was despite lower industry sales including lower industry sales in China. Also just want to mention that we also continued to incur cost in the quarter that is for growth that we\u2019ll see in the future. We also just launched the Hangzhou, China and the Sanand, India plants. So, we had probably more cost of revenue if you will in the second quarter. We\u2019re certainly going to see a lot of revenue coming down at those plants in the balance of the year. The profit did improve year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. I want to highlight that that was actually due to operations outside of China. So, we saw a good improvement in ASEAN, Australia and India, and really excited to see the progress the team has made in these parts of the business. Because we\u2019ve been talking about them for some time as areas that we are really focused on to try to get them moving forward in a positive manner. And the progress that team made here in the second quarter was very, very encouraging. For the region, wholesale volume, revenue and share were down year-over-year due to our consolidated operations -- I am sorry, actually share was down a bit. But within China, we saw wholesales about flat; share in the quarter at 4.7% was actually up a tenth and that equaled the record that we set in the third quarter of 2014. So good results in Asia Pacific; clearly some concerns around China and the slower growth, but for the full year we continue to expect strong results from Asia Pacific and expect those results to exceed those of last year. And Mark, you might want to say something about China. Mark Fields : Yes, let me just give some perspective on the China market because there is obviously a lot of discussion around it. It\u2019s clear we\u2019ve seen a market slowdown in the market there in the industry. We\u2019ve seen commercial vehicles actually come down more than past year vehicles which again is a bit of an indicator to us. And that in turn is putting pressure on the likely suspects around pricing, but we\u2019re also -- we\u2019ve also experienced negative pricing in this market for quite some time, but it\u2019s continuing now. But we have to put this market into perspective. This is -- it\u2019s the biggest market in the world right now. By our forecast it\u2019s going to grow to about 30 million vehicles in the next 5 to 10 years. So we\u2019re still very bullish on China, but it\u2019s going to go through its fluctuations and that\u2019s what happens in emerging markets and we\u2019re going to work our way through it in a positive way, and grow the business. Bob Shanks : Let\u2019s go on to the last of the business units and this one, Ford Credit. Once again, Ford Credit had a very strong quarter and as I mentioned, generated that profit of over $0.5 billion. It was an improvement year-over-year and that was due to higher volume that was driven by higher consumer receivables and also with leasing increase in North America. Mix was favorable. We also saw recurrence of large insurance losses that we saw a year ago due to storms in North America. Ford Credit\u2019s business and credit conditions continue to be very healthy. Our origination practices remain consistent. Costs at Ford Credit are well-controlled and very much in line with expectations. Credit losses remain at historically low levels; delinquencies also remain low; and repossessions also are at historically low levels. So everything that we can see in the business looks robust and very, very positive as we look at the future. In terms of our full year guidance, we\u2019re reconfirming that guidance and that includes the pre-tax profit that would be equal to or higher than in 2014. So with that let\u2019s move on and look at automotive cash. We had very strong cash flow in the quarter, automotive operating-related cash flow you can see here of $1.9 billion. If you go back to the first quarter, we had some pretty large debt repayments and also we had some -- we had characterized most of our pension contributions in the first quarter and we said at that time that we would not see that as we move out the first quarter. So, we\u2019re delivering on that promise because if you look at the $1.9 billion that effectively is flowing through to the change in our gross cash position other than the dividends in the quarter which were about $600 million and that balance is the compensation related share repurchase program. So, we ended the quarter with $20.7 billion of cash and marketable securities; subtract from that the automotive debt of $13.7 billion which was up a bit due to funding in Brazil; we ended the quarter with net cash of $7 billion. Liquidity was also strong at $31.7 billion. So why don\u2019t we go now and move into the future and we\u2019ll look at the business environment on slide 21. So, this is pretty simple. We are projecting a global GDP to grow in the 2.5% to 3% range; this is driven by the U.S., by China, the modest growth that we\u2019re seeing in Europe, euro areas as well as stronger growth in the UK, little concerns still about South America as well as Russia; watching China closely but overall expect pretty good growth on a global basis. Now that is not translating into growth in global automotive industry sales this year which is unusual. And that\u2019s largely because the strong growth in China as Mark and I both talked about that is not translating at least according to our point of view, into growth in China and also Japan which we haven\u2019t talked about today; it is growing, but we expect the Japanese industry to decline in 2015 versus 2014. So with that let\u2019s go on to slide 22 and now I\u2019ll end my comments on planning assumptions and key metrics. We are upgrading our outlook for the Europe 20 industry; we\u2019re taking that up to 15.7 million to 16.2 million units. We are downgrading China, as Mark talked about, to 23 million to 24 million units and then everything else of the other financial metrics on track. We\u2019re clearly on a track to achieve our total company pre-tax profit guidance of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion. So, just seven words to leave with you today outstanding quarter, strong first half, breakthrough year. And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark. Mark Fields : Thanks Bob. So, let me bring this altogether. Obviously our plan and our priorities are unchanged. And we\u2019re on track to deliver our near and our long-term objectives and they have remained the same and that\u2019s about being the top five in global sales, getting a better balance of profits and sales around the world, targeting 8% plus operating margins globally, being in the top quartile of total shareholders returns and then highly regarded by all our stakeholders. We have our three priorities on accelerating our pace of progress on a One Ford plan, delivering our product excellence with passion and of course driving innovation in every part of our business. And the way I described it is, it\u2019s about having one foot firmly planted into today and staying riveted on the business and delivering today\u2019s results. But also one foot firmly planted in tomorrow and taking the point of view on that future and rewinding back to the day and making sure we\u2019re taking the decisions to maximize our success in that timeframe. So, we\u2019re really pushing ourselves to think, to act and disrupt like a startup company. And that really means trying to anticipate customers\u2019 wants and needs in that five, and ten, and fifteen-year down the road timeframe. The second quarter, I think it shows more proof that we have the right strategic framework; we have the right process; and importantly, the right team. And again, it\u2019s one of the strongest quarters in our recent history. It\u2019s a great first half. And we expect the second half to be even better. So with that why not we open to the phone lines. George Sharp : Thanks Mark. Now, we\u2019ll open the lines for about a 45-minute Q&A session. We\u2019ll begin as unusual with questions from the investment community and then take questions from the media. Now in order to allow for as many participants as possible, please keep your questions brief and please avoid asking more than two. Katina, can we have the first question please? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Patrick Archambault, representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Patrick Archambault : First, can we just get back to the supply of the F-150; I guess just a little bit more detail there. I think originally you guys were expecting to have that ramped up sort of midsummer and then I think it became late summer and now it\u2019s more towards the end of the third quarter. What have the issues been and how much confident do you have just surrounding the fix that\u2019s in place to try and get that supply up there? So that\u2019s my first question, just an update on that. Mark Fields : Well to put it into perspective, I think we\u2019ve always said that by the summer we would be at full production, late in the second quarter we\u2019d be at full production which we are. And we\u2019re on track to, as I mentioned earlier, to make sure our inventory is at normal inventory level by the end of third quarter because you know Patrick there\u2019s a little bit of a lag time as we get both plants up to production fully that we have to then shift those to our dealers and then also to fulfill fleet orders. So, we\u2019re on track with our launch as with always launches. We work with our suppliers to make sure it\u2019s successful and we\u2019re doing that. We\u2019re very confident in the product and we couldn\u2019t be again more happy with the kind of response we\u2019re getting with it. We expect in the second half as we get up to stocking levels, we\u2019ll fulfill more fleet orders and we expect our performance in the marketplace to grow. Patrick Archambault : So it sounds like the operational stuff is well in hand. Maybe that dovetails well with my next question which is just on the pricing, which was obviously very, very strong, both on the incentive side and the pure pricing. How do we think about -- maybe that\u2019s sort of a Bob question, but how do we think about that being carried over into the second half? I know that -- I think you sort of launched with some of the higher trim level models, how to Dearborn [ph] first and I think some of the other stuff as less contended but just how do we think about those numbers being carried into the second half? Bob Shanks : If I remember correctly, in the first quarter was at over 70% mix. I think it was a high series and I think we\u2019re at 50% [ph] and I think normal rates, if you go back to the old model, was around 30%. We\u2019ll have to wait and see where this settles out because the demand for this, particularly the higher series is quite strong. And as you saw probably was it this week we launched the Limited. So we got more to come that Limited coming in the winter; we\u2019ve got Raptor coming next year. So, we\u2019re not done plumbing every dollar of revenue we can out of that product. So, we\u2019re very excited about that and the customers are demanding that. As we look at the balance of the year, we expect pricing to continue to be a strong factor in North America\u2019s performance. We clearly expect North America to be stronger in a second half than the first. F series actually did not positively contribute to the bottom line in the quarter because of the fact that was in a launch phase, but we certainly expect in the third and fourth quarters on a year-over-year basis that it will be a positive contributor as we get, as Mark said, the stocks up to normal levels by the end of the third quarter, not just numbers of units but also the derivatives in the series and the mix and so forth. So, you will see strong pricing coming from North America and not just F series but even in the quarter. F series clearly was a factor but there was a lot of different product lines and we were able to generate incremental pricing opportunities on in the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Galves who representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed. Dan Galves : Just sticking with North America, can you give us a little bit of perspective on pricing versus material cost ex commodities which was I think slightly negative year-over-year, if you take those two together? And also if you can talk about the warranty freight positive as well whether that was some sort of non-repeat or whether that\u2019s a sustainable kind of improvement? Bob Shanks : Yes, I\u2019ll comment and if Mark has anything afterwards, he can supplement. If you -- I\u2019d like to go back to what I said in the first quarter, because we actually I think got a very similar question then. I actually don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way to look at, at the way that you phrased the question. We clearly are seeing product costs go up as we invest in the new products and we also see increases in the structural costs as we do, so because of the investments in the plants and so forth. But we\u2019ll get revenue for that and we just talk about for F series but you also get positive mix and then you grow the business, you get volume as well. So, really what you want to look at in terms of what\u2019s happen to the total contribution margin of the business is to look at what you are getting on volume, what are you getting on mix and what are you getting on pricing relative to the product cost and some of the structural costs that you build in to business. And as you can see in this quarter that is what generated the improvement year-over-year. And I\u2019ll mention once again, that was not because the F-150. F-150 really comes on stream in terms of the positive effect in the third and the fourth quarters. And so that will simply add to what we\u2019ve already seen here in the second quarter. So, to me it\u2019s much more -- it\u2019s a broader view of what we\u2019re doing with new products and just looking just those two categories that you\u2019d mentioned Dan. In terms of contribution cost, our contribution cost we had favorable performance year-over-year on warranty as well as on freight. And duties on warranty that was combination of things, it was the non-repeat of some large field service actions that we had last year; we also had some supplier recoveries against some of those actions and other actions as well it might have been in different periods. And we also, as I mentioned, have the good news on freight. And I think that was largely because we had a lot of premium freight last year that we didn\u2019t repeat this year. So going forward, we expect that we\u2019ll continue to have good performance on -- as Mark said, the quality is extremely positive not only in North America but around the world. But field service actions, they happen when they happen based on the data that\u2019s in front of us and kind of hard to forecast that one. But right now, everything looks good. Dan Galves : Second question related to China, I mean great performance in the quarter with earnings up on flat revenue, flat wholesale volumes. Just checking like kind of if you could give us anymore detail on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of pricing? How deteriorated versus -- is the pricing pressure worse today than it\u2019s typically? And also it looks like inventory is up quite bit on a year-over-year basis; is that anything to be concerned about or is that are you at normal levels now? Thank you. Mark Fields : On the inventory, it is up and part of that is due to as we were launching some new products and localizing and we had some bridging stocks. But also as the market has come down, we\u2019re implementing our process which is matching production to demand. So, you can see that in our production for the third quarter which is up healthy, it was up healthier and we\u2019ve taken the appropriate actions to get the inventory in line. So overall, we feel pretty good about the inventory. And in terms of the pricing environment, as we mentioned, listen over the past couple of years, we\u2019ve seen negative pricing in the 1% to 4% range and this year we probably see it in the 4% to 5% range. So, we\u2019re seeing a little bit more and it depends on region and segment. But I think the approach from our team is -- and this is I think the silver lining of a little bit of a downturn in Europe. This is the first time our team is going through a downturn in Europe and we have some very experienced folks\u2026 Bob Shanks : China. Mark Fields : Sorry, in China and we have some very experienced folks both in our operations there and in our JV partner and it\u2019s a great learning opportunity, so that when it goes down we know how to manage through and we know the revenue in a declining market comes off fast. And that\u2019s why the big effort on cost and that was one of the elements that drove our performance in the second quarter and our team will stay focused on that at the same time launching five new products in the balance of this year to drive our top-line. Bob Shanks : And Dan, I just want to supplement. If you look at our guidance on production in the second quarter for Asia Pacific, we originally were at 395,000 units; last year came in at 362,000, so 33,000 units down. And back to Mark\u2019s point, this was a reflection of the team acting very quickly and very proactively as we saw the softening and taking production out ASAP. That\u2019s what we do anytime, anywhere that we see something like that happening, on the upside the reverse and the team really staying on top of what\u2019s happening in the marketplace and protecting the level of dealer stocks that we should have. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli representing Citi. Please proceed. Itay Michaeli : I just want to go back to North America, really strong quarter, 11% margins; you mentioned you have the F-150 really contribute in the second half of the year. Adjusting that the second half margin guidance is maybe implied around 10% which is still pretty strong, but down a bit maybe from Q2, can you help us just walk through couple of puts and takes around the second half outlook as compared to the second quarter? Bob Shanks : We\u2019re going to have a fantastic second half and we had a really good second quarter. So, I actually kind of see the first half performance of 9.1% sort of going up a tick, if you will, as we go into the second half. And that will be aided by what I mentioned earlier in terms of the F-150 contributing positively in the second half versus the first half with the launch effect. So, I don\u2019t know more to say, we\u2019re going to go from really good grade. It\u2019s hard to parse really fabulous performance. Mark Fields : And also within that we have to look at the market and there is a lot of discussion around the market being at a peak. I really term it as a plateau because when you look at what\u2019s driving the market, it\u2019s really around replacement demand. And in any mature market, about 80% of the industry in any given year is driven by replacement demand. And we know the age of the car park which is over 11 years old. So we think that bodes well. Within the market, we\u2019re seeing actually incentives. We have to watch that closely because incentives are up year-over-year when you look at the U.S. market than actually been up every month. But interestingly, incentives are up every month on cars; they are actually about even to down on trucks. So that\u2019s an area we got to stay focused on, but we expect our performance to continue to be strong in North America. Itay Michaeli : And then just my second question on Asia Pacific and again very good results, can you remind me what went right in the quarter? I think in the first quarter call, you talked maybe about I think breakeven second quarter on Asia-Pac, so maybe what went right there in the second quarter, if I missed it? Bob Shanks : Yes, I just touched on that in my comments. Itay, it\u2019s cost performance. Mark and I were sitting here three months ago, they looked more like a breakeven type performance, but the team did despite the production adjustments that we referenced earlier, the team did a great job on cost performance. The other thing that was great about the quarter is the performance improvements that we saw outside of China. So that was another big contributor, the improved results in ASEAN, Australia and India. As you know those are areas we\u2019ve been focused on trying to get them moving forward in fastest manner and we did get traction on that in the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan representing UBS. Please proceed. Colin Langan : I just want to understand why did you not take the total company guidance up, given you had $4.3 billion in the first-half, if you set the second half, at least earlier you set second half stronger. What keeps you cautious from picking it quite higher into that range? Bob Shanks : Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re being cautious. We think that the range covers the likely outcomes if you think about the first half, we made $4.3 billion, so that gives us the opportunity to do what is at 5.2 [ph] in the second half, that\u2019s a much stronger second half than the first half to be at the top end of the guidance. So I think we just feel comfortable that there is no need to change the guidance and we believe that at the top end, that covers the potential upside if you will that we\u2019re looking at. Colin Langan : Should we still think the cadence being stronger in the second half for the total company or is that changed given how strong Q2 was? Bob Shanks : I\u2019m sorry. Could you say that again? Colin Langan : Should we still think that second half is stronger than the first half or is that changed given Q2\u2026? Bob Shanks : No. We definitely think the second half is stronger. I mean, if we just multiply the first half by two, we\u2019re at eight, six [ph] and we think that we\u2019ve got, as I mentioned, clearly upside opportunity in the second half and expect to deliver that. Colin Langan : And my second question, can you clarify the F-150 pricing? Obviously there is a local dealer advertising at $10,000 incentive. Has there been a change at all month-over-month in the F-150 incentive structure? Obviously it\u2019s created a lot of headlines. Mark Fields : Colin, it did generate a lot of headlines. And as you know, incentives and rebates, they are normal part of the competitive environment and we use them to either encourage customers to buy more fully equipped vehicles or to finance it forward credit or to reward loyalty. But overall when you look nationally, our incentives on F-150 are around $3,800 or so. It\u2019s down year-over-year. That $10,000 figure that was thrown out, part of it is based on incentives that are available on all vehicles that dealers can add up to and in some cases, some dealer associations, of those a small minority of them decided to add to that. So in some cases, it was $10,000 but overall when you look at our average incentive of around $3,900 and it being lower than the segment and much lower than some of our competitors, I think it reflects the strength of the product. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy, representing Bank of America. Please proceed. John Murphy : Just to parse by results Bob just to understand North America little more. I hate to do this, but on slide 10 there is one number, the stocks positive 451; is that just a reversal of something that was unusual last year and we\u2019re looking at more normal or is that an unusual benefit this quarter? Bob Shanks : Now, what is was, as we grew stocks by 7,000 units within this quarter and in fact if you go to appendix 6, it\u2019s pretty clear. I am sorry, we actually reduced stocks. We reduced stocks by -- actually for the region we increased stocks by 7,000 and we reduced in North America and the U.S. but we had increases elsewhere and last year, we actually had a decline. So it\u2019s the absence of the stock reduction last year on a relative basis that\u2019s generating the good news. Mark Fields : John, part of it is, the industry is growing. So clearly you expect our inventories to keep up. To Bob\u2019s point, overall when you look at it, our inventory levels here in the U.S. are about 608,000 and that\u2019s down from about 643,000 last year. So our day supply are about 70 and this time last year it was about 72. So, we feel good about our inventory levels. Bob Shanks : But the number you\u2019re talking about the 451, that\u2019s a non-repeat of a stock reduction last year; it was a smaller stock reduction this year. John Murphy : Yes. So, last year was a little bit more unusual, this year was normal. It\u2019s really as what I trying to understand that\u2019s the thing what\u2019s going. Bob Shanks : Yes. John Murphy : And then staying on North America, I mean, Mark, you alluded to the medium-duty or the Super Duty launches that\u2019s upcoming in Kentucky Truck and that\u2019s not something getting lot of headlines but that could be a real big benefit above and beyond what\u2019s going on with the F-150 on the truck side. Just to understand if you guys can talk about that a little bit and when sort of there might be a little bit of a weight in results because of that changeover and when the benefits should ultimately come because that could be a big part of the story as well? Mark Fields : Well, we\u2019ll get into that more as we start talking about 2016 but focusing on 2015, obviously in the next month or so, we\u2019re going be launching the medium-duty truck out of Ohio. And that\u2019s a really important product because that only -- we have a lot of customers and have those products, it drives a lot of ancillary commercial businesses across our other vehicle lines. So, we\u2019re excited about getting that up and running. And keep in mind that\u2019s a product we\u2019re bringing back and manufacturing here in the U.S. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas, representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Adam Jonas : Bob, first a quick one. Can you tell us current capacity utilization at Changan Ford, even roughly to the nearest 500 basis points? Bob Shanks : No. We don\u2019t provide that information publicly. The stock level -- the capacity is relatively well utilized but Hangzhou for example which we just launched that\u2019s got about 250? 250, I think in that particular plant but we\u2019re just launching it. So we\u2019ve got the Taurus coming later, so there\u2019s a lot of room for us to grow into that plant. Adam Jonas : And Mark, just a follow-up, so I\u2019ve checked the last four earnings call transcripts and I searched Ford like Apple and Google and Uber and actually none of them have come up in any of your prepared remarks or in the Q&A of the transcripts. I take on board fully what you said about trying to create the startup culture and disrupt yourself and that was very evident when we toured the research facilities in Palo Alto. So can you share with us management\u2019s and the board\u2019s, say high level thoughts on whether players like Apple, Google or Uber are actually emerging competitors, not just that represents an opportunity but could they also be competitors in designing engineering cars and the things that you do? Thanks. Mark Fields : We haven\u2019t heard what Apple is doing. To my knowledge, they haven\u2019t announced anything. But from our standpoint, you know our process, we\u2019re always looking at the business environment. And we\u2019re seeing folks like Uber, who knows what Apple is going to do or Google is going to do? First off, we think -- first off that it\u2019s positive for the industry in terms of generating competition and innovation and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving us. But sure, we could see some of those players be competitors to us, in some cases they could be partners to us et cetera. We\u2019re looking at the whole waterfront here. And we know there\u2019s a lot of people that are interested in the automotive space and would like to extract some value out of that. We\u2019re very cognizant of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman, representing J.P. Morgan. Please proceed. Ryan Brinkman : You talked in your prepared remarks about tracking in the upper half of the 8.5% to 9.5% North American margin target for the full year. It seems pretty easily attainable now; so, you\u2019re already at 9.1% in the first half, at least according to IHS you\u2019re going to build 19% more F-150s in the back half than the first which by the math should help quite a bit. So, I understand there are lot of moving pieces, not just the F150. But does the 2Q result now introduce the possibility that you will not just be in the top out the North American margin target for the full year, which you already are, but you might be above it? Bob Shanks : I think it\u2019s more appropriate for us to cover -- I said on the upper half. We\u2019re always working to do better but I think upper half is where we\u2019re likely to land. Ryan Brinkman : And this is really the same question. In last quarter\u2019s earnings deck, you included a slide, not in this deck, that showed pre-tax results by quarter as a percentage of expected full year pre-tax profit ramping sequentially from 1Q to 2Q and then from 2Q to 3Q before it was flat in 4Q. I know the guidance today is stronger in the back half than the first half. Do you still think that results improve from 2Q to 3Q or whether that 3Q is a greater percentage of full year pre-tax profits than 2Q? Bob Shanks : Well, the purpose of that slide, Ryan, was to demonstrate that unlike most years where the first half is stronger than the second half and oftentimes you will see the first quarter compete with the second quarter in terms of which one is the strongest, that was not going to be the case this year, we want to show that. Also what\u2019s normal is the fourth quarter being the weakest and actually quite a bit weaker than most of the other quarters of the year. And we felt that the fourth quarter, have the opportunity to be much stronger than normal particularly because of the cadence of our launches. That\u2019s still all true. And we still expect as a result, the second quarter to be strong and stronger than the first half. So, very consistent with what we\u2019ve been seen, but didn\u2019t think it was necessary to put the chart and since the half is over and we\u2019ve only got two quarters go and within the \u201cstronger second half\u201d and expect to deliver that. Ryan Brinkman : And then last question Europe, it was pretty good actually. It seems the biggest variance there was pricing. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving that? I imagine Mondeo, S-Max, Galaxy coming through but some of the other drivers you\u2019ve been working on maybe on channel mix, self-registrations, rental car or the [indiscernible] I\u2019m just trying to understand, I know 3Q is going to be softer seasonally but does the year-over-year pricing tailwind remain with us as we progress throughout the year? Bob Shanks : Yes, you\u2019re actually spot on in terms of what drove it; there\u2019s one other factor I\u2019ll mention, but yes that\u2019s new products doing very well. The team has been focusing on brand and the network and customer service and that\u2019s translating into some incremental power in terms of pricing, particularly combined with the new products. The other thing that you didn\u2019t mention that\u2019s the factor, we\u2019re now consolidating Russia. So somewhat similar to South America where we\u2019re seeing some very positive pricing as we try to offset the effects of high local inflation and weak currencies, the exact same things going on in Russia where the team is doing the same thing. So, you\u2019ve got that phenomenon also in this quarter on a year-over-year basis because of the consolidation of Russia but everything else you said is true. And I would expect as we go into the third and fourth quarters that we will continue to see positive pricing in Europe. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner, representing CLSA. Please proceed. Emmanuel Rosner : So, I have a question on North America and the one on China. On North America, I would like to come back to the earnings walk on slide 10. So, I completely agree with your point that the increased I guess material cost results not only in better pricing but also better mix and market share and volume. I\u2019m just curious how you see these material costs evolve over the rest of the year? I think in Q1, it was increase in cost of about $600 million and now it\u2019s about $1 billion and then obviously more new F-150s coming is also more new materials in there. How would you see that evolve over the next couple of quarters? Bob Shanks : I think, let\u2019s look at it from a couple of different ways. I think you will see year-over-year increases that will start to mitigate because we had some of the products that are affected in the later quarters of last year. So, what I do think you\u2019ll see as we go forward is that the effects will be largely mitigated sequentially. So, we have what we have. Some of that will continue to show up on a year-over-year basis, but sequentially we\u2019re kind of where we would expect to be because the launches are behind us. Emmanuel Rosner : And then on China, so just would like to come back on the quarter\u2019s performance; it was obviously an incredibly strong equity income quarter for in the 400 million which is although more remarkable in sort like the flattish volume environment, but also in Ford incurring all these costs from opening new plants. How sustainable do you view this performance in light of the dynamics that you described before in China? Bob Shanks : We expect the operations to continue perform well. We actually expect the volume to be greater in the second half than the first half as we launch the new plant. We got the new launches coming -- product launches that Mark talked about. And some of those products, the Edge, three-row Edge, the Taurus, the Everest; those are going to be higher margin products. So I think that will fairly show up in the results. So I think we feel quite good about the performance in the second half relative to first half and overall for the full year. The one thing I just want to remind you and everyone else that\u2019s listening in is when you\u2019re looking at those equity after tax earnings, that\u2019s not the total picture of China, that\u2019s just the joint ventures. So, if you recall, I said that our year-over-year results for Asia Pacific actually were not driven by China even though you can see that improvement at the JVs; it was driven by the operations outside and that\u2019s because we\u2019ve got EU imports which are consolidated, we\u2019ve Lincoln which we\u2019re investing in which is consolidated, and you\u2019ve got engineering that we\u2019re incurring on behalf of the joint ventures that they will reimburse for later, once we start building those products that we\u2019re engineering at some point in the future, will get that composition through royalty. So, when you take the total picture of China because of what was going on in the consolidated part of our business, it was actually down slightly. We had launch balance out of Edge as Mark talked about, we had balance out of export as we\u2019re getting ready to launch the new Explorer, we have the investments in Lincoln and we have higher engineering for products we\u2019re working on for the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache, representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Rod Lache : I was hoping just kind of a higher level question about China. Obviously one of the fears in the market is that just given the amount of capacity that\u2019s coming on line that it could just be broadly for the industry a significant deterioration in profitability. It\u2019s happened in other emerging markets, once growth in supply reaches or exceeds growth in demand. Can you give us a little bit more color on how does the earnings bridge look like? If you see 4% to 5% negative from pricing, what does every 1% imply for you as a headwind? And for every 1% change in volume, what does that do for you as a tailwind; how should we be thinking about the bridge and the levers that you can pull to mitigate that? Bob Shanks : Well, let me just answer your question directly first and maybe provide a bit of color and then Mark could supplement. So 1% for is $90 million -- $100 million, but I guess the thing I would think about is if you look at our portfolio, we have actually a pretty rich portfolio. We have a very strong SUV portfolio, the Mondeo, the Kuga, the three-row Edge, the Taurus, the Everest, which is body-on-frame utility that\u2019s going to come off at the same platform as our Global Ranger. These are pretty high margin products. And I think that probably puts us in a pretty good position because as you think about where the competitive pressures be, I\u2019m sure it will be across the industry. But there will be a lot of that particularly at the lower end of the market particularly where you get maybe some overlap at the low end of the international brands with the indigenous brands. So, I think the place we occupy in the market is a pretty healthy place. We also have opportunities for cost reductions; the team is continuing to make improvements there. And as we mentioned, we\u2019ve got Hangzhou plant coming on, but we\u2019re only going to man the plant to the level of volume that we actually believe is appropriate and that we can deliver from the plant. So, I think that as we go in, knowing the softness in the market, I think gives us the ability to plan that very effectively. Anything you want to add? Mark Fields : Yes, the only thing I want to add Rod is when you look at the capacity coming on line at Hangzhou, as Bob mentioned, I mean it\u2019s for products that are in pretty high demand. We\u2019re localizing the Edge and obviously SUVs and a seven-seater SUV is in demand, the Taurus that\u2019s coming or large sedan, it\u2019s a pretty significant segment there that has pretty good revenues and Everest as Bob mentioned. But even the -- in the Escort, we launched that earlier this year and that is as I mentioned that\u2019s the fastest growing model in the segment and it\u2019s appealing particularly across the regions but particularly Tier 3 through 6. But across all this, as we look at the industry, look at the pricing et cetera, it\u2019s not only a focus on the top-line, team is taking a very intense focus on the costs and the costs in the industry. And that is the benefit, if you will, of looking at an industry which we\u2019re now calling flat to down and getting ahead of things. So we\u2019re working both ends. Rod Lache : And that is what drove the performances in the quarter? Mark Fields : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson, representing Barclays. Please proceed. Brian Johnson : I want to wish George Sharp farewell and hope you enjoy retirement. We will certainly miss him and his sense of history, shall I say. So I want to quote couple of things, just a little housekeeping for Bob on North America and then a broader question on China. On North America, you talked about the F-150 having no contribution. Is the way we ought to be thinking about is that the volume decrement was roughly equal to the pricing less material cost contribution? Bob Shanks : On a year-over-year basis, it did not generate, if you will, incremental profits and that\u2019s because the volume was lower. We also were in launch mode, so we had all the costs, the structural costs associated with the launch but didn\u2019t have the plants producing at capacity. That will not be the case in the third and the fourth quarter. So when I look at the data for third and fourth quarter year-over-year for F-150, it\u2019s a strong positive contributor to the bottom-line all in; and that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to convey in terms of the effect it had in the first, second relative to the third and fourth quarters. Brian Johnson : Okay. So, we can expect that change as we go -- get passed some of those launch costs as well as full volume? Bob Shanks : Yes. Brian Johnson : And second question on China is kind of Mark. You talked about disruptive innovations in mobility and at the same time you talked about China at some point getting to 30 million cars. I guess, when you think about where transportation could go in China, kind of ten years out. What\u2019s the real argument for such a densely populated urban country getting to the levels of penetration you\u2019d need for that? And are we going to look at kind of new mobility models as maybe kind of taking some of the wind out of those sales? And if so or even if not, how would you primarily with your upper-end -- mid-upper-end product line in China kind of participate in those new models in China? Mark Fields : I think when you look at the overall size of the market, keep in mind that the Tier 3 through 6 cities, these are cities that are still growing, still cities where people are coming from the countryside and moving in. You don\u2019t have the license plate restriction that you do in some of the Tier 1 and 2 cities. So we think a lot of that is going provide the growth to that 30 millionish number in the next five to ten years and still be somewhat manageable. In terms of the overall -- the mega cities, the cities of 10 million or more, I mean there is a lot of debate around what is that going to mean to the size of the industry. And right now, there is no clear answers, because you could argue that car and ridesharing increases the asset utilization which could reduce the car park, but also on the other side more efficient utilization of those assets and a greater just overall access to mobility could actually increase the total miles driven which could increase vehicle sales. It will definitely increase service business, for example with the duty cycles that these vehicles going through. So that\u2019s we\u2019re looking at. And overall as we look at these experiments and pilots, we have our team focused on this. We\u2019re looking at some of the innovative approaches, particularly in China which Baidu and Didi Kuaidi is implementing. And as I said, you\u2019ll see over the next number of months and year or so, in terms of what we\u2019re doing to create some pilots and create some business models out of this that not only can open new business opportunities for us but complement our existing business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak, representing RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed. Joe Spak : Mark and Bob, maybe just to follow on some of your recent comments, I think numerous times you\u2019ve talked about how a lot of your growth in China needs to be driven from those Tier 3 to 6 cities. So maybe you could just give us a little bit more color as to what you are seeing the impact or what\u2019s going on kind of in those cities right now, maybe what the growth is in those cities versus some of the larger cities. Mark Fields : We\u2019re seeing, as we said, larger percentage growth in those cities. And again, part of it has to do with the fact that most of those cities don\u2019t have the restrictions that you do in the larger cities around license plates and lotteries that they have for that. As we look at our business, if you look this year for example, 85% of our dealer appointments are going to be in the Tier 3 through 6 cities. And actually if you look at our wholesales in the quarter, our wholesales in those Tier through 6 cities, were more than double percentage increases than in Tier 1 and 2 cities. So, we think we\u2019re well-positioned. The Escort as I mentioned is really resonating with customers there but also at the same time as Bob mentioned earlier, the full line up of SUVs that we have, small, medium and large we think will serve us well. Joe Spak : And so, maybe a quick one on South America, obviously a very difficult environment, it seems the product is responding well in that tough environment. I know you\u2019ve taken some actions there in the past, is there anything more you can do? Are you rightsized for this level and is it just about a volume rebound at this point? Bob Shanks : The team has done a great job of managing the environment. They have taken appropriate actions on capacity, headcount, personnel levels. We\u2019ve also been working very hard on total costs. They\u2019re looking as how we can -- obviously we were quite localized because we\u2019ve been there for 80 years but we\u2019re even trying to find further opportunities to shield the business from the weakening currencies. We are also working to try to get as much as we can in terms of mix of the products. So the teams doing everything they can but Joe, the environment is so difficult, it\u2019s going to be tough I think for anybody to make sense out of that business in South America until the recovery takes place. As I mentioned in my comments, there aren\u2019t any signs of that happening yet. So we\u2019re just going to have to hunker down, continue to go after every dollar of costs that we possibly can but this really going to depend for the industry on a recovery and the external environment. Mark Fields : But I do think, we\u2019re well-positioned, to your point, around our new products are resonating and we are growing share or 10% share in the region now. So, I think that bodes well. I mean put in a perspective before 2013, the nine years before, we were pretty strongly profitable down that region. I think clearly in the mid to long-term we expect that to return but we\u2019re going to have work our way through difficult economic environment. Operator : The next question comes from the line of George Galliers, representing Evercore. Please proceed. George Galliers : I had a quick question just really to the strategic on China. One of your competitors just announced plans to develop common architecture in engines with its Chinese JV partner for a global car to be sold in emerging market. Obviously your platform and One Ford strategy is well flagged. How do you think about co-developing future product with your Chinese partner for sale in other markets not just in Asia but globally, is that something you\u2019re already looking at or planning on looking at? Mark Fields : Well, as you mentioned, with our One Ford strategy, we have now gone from 27 platforms down to 9 and ultimately to 8. Obviously, we have a couple of partners in China, both Changan at CAF and JMC which is our commercial truck partner. And the bottom line is nothing to talk about at this point but of course as our relationship grows, we will look at those opportunities. We\u2019re well positioned now. But as I said, as those relationships grow, could offer us the opportunity to do that. George Galliers : And then also you mentioned the fact that you\u2019re seeing stronger growth in the Tier 3 and smaller cities in China. Can you give any color on how your market share compares in those regions relative to the 4.7%, you have for the full market? Bob Shanks : I don\u2019t have the exact number in front of me but our market share in those regions is quite good relative to the more developed cities. We\u2019re actually in the middle of the country in Chongqing and our performance is strong in the middle of the country; it\u2019s good in the 3 through 6 cities. And I think that actually positions us well going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston, representing Morningstar. Please proceed. David Whiston : Mark, a question for you, going back to in your opening comments on disruption and how it\u2019s an opportunity; one of those opportunities is for the industry to have more ubiquitous software updates and perhaps not have a customer go to a dealer at all. And so is that an opportunity -- certainly for convenience, but is that an opportunity for Ford to charge for those upgrades or do you expect the customer to get those for free or perhaps a combination? And related to that, is there a lot of opportunity for cost reduction potential on -- particularly on recall repair from these updates? Mark Fields : Well, obviously we\u2019re thinking through the consumer experience as we go forward. And clearly with the things like over the year updates offers, as you mentioned opportunity to make customers\u2019 lives easier and also opportunity as you mentioned to reduce cost for recalls, can\u2019t get into specifics about how we\u2019re going to approach that in terms of pricing et cetera. But our approach overall as we\u2019re looking at our products and we\u2019re looking at our services, the approach we\u2019re taking with our marketing and our engineering communities, we want our people thinking about experiences and then subsequently how does technology enable those experiences and obviously then what we can price for it, but clearly a big opportunity for us to better satisfy the customer and also improve our business going forward. Operator : With no further questions at this time, I\u2019d now like to hand the call back to Mr. George Sharp for any closing remarks. George Sharp : Okay. Thank you Katina and thanks everyone. We\u2019re really glad that you are able to join us today. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

Mark Fields : Great thanks, Ted. And good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. The overall headline is we had an outstanding third quarter and we remain on track to deliver breakthrough year. Looking at the numbers, we are in $2.7 billion and pre-tax profit which was more than double a year ago. We were at $1.9 million in net income also more than doubled. Our automotive operating margin came in at 6.5%, which was up four points. Our automotive operating related cash flow was $2.8 billion and this resulted in a number of records for the quarter. We had a record third quarter pre-tax profit and a record third quarter automotive operating related cash flow. As we look at the business units, we had our best quarter ever in North America, we are best third quarter at Ford Credit since 2011. And we have not had a better third quarter in Europe since 2009 and South America improved despite the tougher external conditions that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. Now along with those results we also delivered strong topline growth. Our wholesale volume was up 7%, our revenue was up 9% or 16% at constant exchange. And our global market share came in three-tenths of a point higher and that's the third quarter in a row of year-over-year global share growth. Now along with this growth we also achieved sustained pricing power and that's really on the back of the strength of our new products. And if you take a step back and look at the first nine months of the year it\u2019s an equally strong headline. We earned $7 billion in pre-tax profit and $5.2 billion in automotive operating related cash flow and both are more than all of last year. Looking at our launches 14 of our 16 new vehicle launches have been completed successfully and that's on top of the record 24 global launches, which we had last year. Importantly, our quality remains strong and it\u2019s also improving in every region around the world. Turning to F-150, our F-150 is performing extremely well in the marketplace and we also just revealed our all-new Super Duty, which will be coming in 2016. And looking at our third quarter F-Series sales in the U.S., well it was our best sales in nine years. And we also continue to build on our strong truck franchise around the world. If you look at Ranger, well that\u2019s the best-selling pickup in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam and the Philippines. And the Ford brand is the commercial vehicle leader in Europe and we recorded our best sales in 12 years there lead by the Transit family. Now, even as we\u2019re delivering in these results with one foot in today, we also have one foot in tomorrow, delivering emerging opportunities through Ford\u2019s Smart Mobility. And Smart Mobility is our plan to take Ford to the next level using innovation in connectivity, mobility [Audio Dip] and our year-to-date results our plan, our people and our process are delivering and importantly creating value for our stakeholders. And as we go into the fourth quarter and close the year and go into 2016 and beyond we\u2019re going to stay absolutely focused on our three priorities, which are accelerating the pace of progress on our One Ford plan delivering product excellence with passion and driving innovation in every part of our business. So at this point I\u2019ll let Bob take us through some slides. Robert Shanks : Okay, Mark, thanks. And on behalf of the 195,000 men and women around the world of Ford, I'm very pleased to take you through the details of what they accomplished in the third quarter. Let's start on Slide 4, on the upper left and let's start with the topline. So we delivered a very, very strong performance on both wholesale volume and revenue as Mark mentioned, wholesale volume was up 7% and revenue was up 9%, 16% if you adjust for constant exchange. Going down looking at the operating results both the automotive sector and financial services contributed strongly to the third quarter record profit of $2.7 million. And we had earnings per share of $0.45, which was up $0.21. Now after two quarters of no special items, we have a special item this quarter it\u2019s a positive item of a $166 million and that reflects an investment that we have in an aluminum casting supplier named Nemak. They had an IPO in the quarter, so we revalued that investment inline with the IPO that generated this non-cash improvement of $166 million. Now just for information going forward, we will mark-to-market this investment each quarter and will reflect the gains or losses in other automotive. Now that combined with the strong pre-tax results generated the after-tax result to net income of $1.9 million which was up 129% from a year ago and earnings per share $0.48. Going down to automotive cash flow $2.8 million very strong and again the third quarter record. We ended the period with $22.2 billion in cash, automotive debt of $12.8 and net cash of $9.4 billion. If you look at the year-to-date results just two things I want to highlight. Again on the pre-tax results $7 million that we have generated so far that is 10% higher than what we generated in all of last year on a pre-tax basis. If you go down the slide further and let\u2019s go back to the operating related cash flow. Again compared with all of last year what we\u2019ve done through the first nine months is already 44% higher so very, very strong performance through the first nine months of the year. Let me just close with a couple of comments on taxes, so let's talk about the quarter first. I have seen a lot of articles thus far that\u2019s highlighting the tax rate difference so versus first call estimate, we nailed the operating results, we came in a little bit different on the tax rate, we originally had guided to 34%, we actually came in at 33%, the first call estimate was 32%, so that entirely explain the $0.01 difference from the first call estimate. For the full-year, we are revising our guidance for the tax rate; we have been at 26% which was about where we were last year. It looks like now we are going to come in at about 30%. All right let's go on and we will look at the automotive sector on a more detail on Slide 5. Let\u2019s just go right through the bars going from left to right so the wholesales were up 103,000 units 7%, revenue was up $3 billion that\u2019s 9% again 16% after we adjust for exchange the operating margin up more than 2.5 times and 6.5% and we tripled our pre-tax results at $2.2 billion. To go to the lower left, you can see the global industry SAAR was actually up 1 million units that was driven by North America and Europe and global market share was up three tens of a point to 7.6% again the third consecutive year-over-year improvement on a quarterly basis. And that was broad-based that was driven by North America, South America and Europe and again go back and look at the year-to-date results just below the bars and they are improved right across the board. Okay, let\u2019s go on to Slide 6 and we will look at what drove the $1.5 billion improvement in our automotive sector results. The simple answer is very strong market factors, very strong volume and favorable mix and very strong net pricing and you can that that was far in excess of the investments that we continue to make in the business to support growth not only in this quarter, but in the quarters and years ahead. Okay, let\u2019s go on to Slide 7, and here we will look at the absolutes by segment within the automotive sector. North America had that fantastic result that was mentioned $2.7 billion, that\u2019s the best quarter that North America has ever had. And if you look at the other business units while accumulatively in a loss, this is the fourth quarter in a row that they have improved on a year-over-year basis and in this quarter improved by $240 million. Looking at other automotive that is primarily net interest expense and we continue to expect our full year results in that space this year to be $650 million. Okay, let\u2019s go on to Slide 8, and we will start going through the business units and I will start with North America as usual. And if you go left to right here tremendous results right across the Board, wholesales up 16% and within that 106,000 units you had 45,000 units coming from F-150 so we are back with the F-150 full availability, we ended the quarter with kind of inventories that we would like to see and we are ready to move forward now into the fourth and continue the strong performance that was already referenced. If you look at revenue that was a very strongly at 19%, operating margin 11.3% this is even better than we did in the second quarter. And if you look at the pre-tax results again that\u2019s best ever result of $2.7 billion. If you look at the SAAR\u2019s both on a regional basis and in the U.S. we had strong improvement on a year-over-year basis and whichever way you look at it our share improved. The North American share improved, the U.S. market share improved and our U.S. retail of retail which isn\u2019t shown also improved by 0.4 points so very strong performance and very strong industries resulting in extraordinarily strong financial results something we are very proud of and if you look at the year-to-date results again right across the board improved compared with the prior year. Okay let\u2019s going to Slide 8 and we\u2019ll looking it was behind the $1.3 billion improvement in North America again very similar to what we saw in the automotive sector is market factors, very strong volume and mix, a strong net pricing and again in excess of the investments that we've made to grow the business in this quarter and in forward years. The other item I would callout is in other we saw strong performance also coming from our parts and services business. Mark Fields : Just a couple comments on the F-150 because there is always lots of interest in F-150 and the bottom line is we are seeing very strong demand for the product .We\u2018re continuing to see a rich mix, we see fast turn rates much faster than the segment average. In the transaction prices are up $2800 year-over-year and higher than our two main competitors. And if you think about retail market share, our retail market share in the quarter it actually climbed above the pre-change over levels and we believe there is more upside in our total share as we begin shipping more F-150's to our fleet customers during the fourth quarter and into next year. Robert Shanks : And because of that we\u2019re expecting North America to have a very, very strong year with topline growth and also full-year process that will be higher than what we achieved last year and we are now revising our guidance on the margin to be at the upper end of our guidance at 8.5% to 9.5%, so really strong performance from North America driving the overall company. Let\u2019s going and look at South America and actually some really great things happening year. Our team has done a wonderful job in a very tough environment of delivering a result it's actually a little bit better than what it was last year. If you look at the wholesale the wholesales are down 10% in industries that are down 20% for the region, 25% in Brazil, if you look at revenue, revenues down 32% almost all of that it is exchange related. Operating margin down of lower revenue, but you can see the pre-tax result actually come in and slightly better than what it was a year ago. If you look at our share in the lower left very strong performance both in the region and in Brazil that was driven once again by the very strong market reaction to the Ford call, If you look the year-to-date performance were down on the topline between better in terms of the financial results again based on what the team is done and is very tough environment. So hats off to the team in South America. Let\u2019s going to Slide 11 and look at the small change year-over-year and you can see that it was really driven by net pricing most of that is to recover the effects of the inflation and also the depreciating currencies, but if you look on the volume and mix callout box you can see the big impact of the industry decline which is partially offset by the strong share performance the team is delivered. For the full-year we continue to expect to have pre-tax loss that will be reduced compared with 14, but we feel very good about what the team is done and clearly has positioned the business recover very quickly once the external environment starts to cooperate. Okay let\u2019s go onto Europe on Slide 12. Again some good things to callout here very strong topline performance wholesales up 17%, the revenue was up modestly in dollars only 2%, but if you look at it again on exchange adjusted basis up 16%. The operating margin and the pre-tax results improved by nearly 60%. If you go down to the third quarter SAARs and shares, you can see very strong growth both in the regional - at the regional level, but also in Europe 20. We did improved share across the region we had a small decline in Europe 20 which was driven by the launch ramp up of the S-Max and the Galaxy, along with the aging of the Fiesta. On a year-to-date basis were seen improvement in wholesales revenue is off again that's more than explained by exchange and strong improvement in terms of the financial results. Okay let\u2019s going to the next Slide and we look at what was behind the $257 million improvement in Europe's results and again very similar to auto sector very similar to North America in the back of great products and good go-to-market strategies you can see the improvement in volume and mix and net pricing more than offset by or partially offset by very modest increases in cost. If you'll at other that is largely explained by the consolidation of Russia. So overall again the teams doing a great job here having us moving forward in a positive direction that we feel that were very much on track to move towards a profitable position will be talking about that more early in 2016. Mark Fields : In just a couple comments are as you look at our transformation plan which we had in place for a while it's gaining momentum and were confident that were on track for return to profitability in the region. If you look at the industry overall it\u2019s improving but it's still a bit of a two speed recovery with markets like U.K. and Germany doing better than some of the southern markets. But that being said, it's improving. The commercial vehicle segment industry itself is performing well and Ford's commercial vehicle performance is doing extremely well. We were the number one commercial vehicle brand in the region for the quarter and also for the full year. So really is an exceptional performance on our commercial vehicle side by our Transit. We are still seeing some muted pricing across the industry. But Ford's mix and rates are strong. And I think all this combine has allowed us to not only grow our share but also improve the financial performance that Bob just brought you through. Robert Shanks : Okay, thanks. Let\u2019s go on Slide 14, and we\u2019ll look briefly at Middle East and Africa. We want to highlight here is not so much the financials, the absolute to relatively small. The results are near breakeven. But the team in Dubai is doing a good job, they\u2019ve laid out an overall strategic framework for how we can participate and what's going to be a very important region in the next 5, 10, 10 years and starting to put the building blocks at actions in place in order for us to participate in that.  In the quarter they did announce a partnership with a local company in Nigeria for us to start assembly of Ranger pickups, relatively soon. So again for the full year we expect to deliver about breakeven results. Let\u2019s move on Asia Pacific on Slide 15, again looking at the key metrics here a little bit different than some of the other reasons, we\u2019ve look at the wholesales were down by 12% 40,000 units, 35,000 of that was in China, and I will come back to that in just a minute. The revenue was flat in dollar terms but again adjusted for inflation it was up 12% and just remind you that does exclude the China joint ventures because they\u2019re unconsolidated. The operating margin was down and the pre-tax results were generally inline with where they were last year. If you look at the Asia-Pacific SAAR that declined and it was more than explained by a reduction in the China industry SAAR. In terms of our share our Asia-Pacific share was down a tenth at 3.5% that was driven by Australia. And in China you can see that we held our share 4.7% that equaled the quarterly record that we set a year ago. If you look below the bars you see the year-to-date results basically downward across the board. Now let's look at I am sorry, I should also comment on the fact that if you go back within the bars on Slide 15. We do have the equity after-tax earnings and our China JVs, you can see they were down about 15%.  Let\u2019s go the next side and I'll give you some of the insights in terms of what's happening. So a pretty modest decline but within the numbers, let\u2019s look at the volume in the next call off box, you can see the pretty sizable stock adjustment. We took stocks down in the quarter and that was something that we have talked about in the second quarter calls, we wanted to get our days supply inline with decline that we have seen in the overall industry. We progressed on that in the first half we needed to go further in the third quarter and the team did a good job of that may also did call the overall run rate of sales properly. So we did end the quarter, right where we wanted to be in terms of stocks. But it did affect profits on a year-over-year basis by about $130 million. The other thing you don't see on the slide is we had a supplier constraint that\u2019s in our result that constrained our production and affected profits to the tune of about $60 million. So overall we think the team is responded well to the slowdown that we seen in China and we are expecting to have a very strong fourth quarter in fact, we think it's likely to be a record quarter on the back of new products and in some cases built in new capacity that\u2019s come on stream this year. We also expect to see a seasonal increase in China that we always see in the fourth quarter as the industry prepares for Chinese New Year early in the following year. And then of course the government has taken a number of simulative actions recently including the purchase tax reduction, which will favorably benefit about 70% of our portfolio and we\u2019ve already seen the benefits of that in our showroom, so we feel very strong and positive about the full year and looking forward to the fourth quarter. Mark Fields : And just a couple comments on the China industry, we are seeing stabilization and as Bob mentioned we do expect to lift from the stimulus package. And as he mentioned we are seeing showroom traffic improve, we are seeing closing ratios improve and unquestionably we see this as a really good opportunity, because 70% of our sales have the engines that are eligible for the stimulus. And just across Asia-Pacific as Bob mentioned we\u2019re confident in a strong fourth quarter. And as he mentioned likely up it\u2019s going to be a record and it\u2019s because of the industry lift, the new products which happen to be good margin products, we are after optimal stocking level so we won't experience the destocking we have in the third quarter. The supplier constraint is behind us and than the seasonal factor so we feel really good about where we are heading in the fourth quarter and into next year. Robert Shanks : Okay, very good. Let\u2019s go on to Ford Credit on Slide 17. Ford Credit again I mentioned it earlier, but very, very strong performance. The best quarterly results since 2011 at $541 million and that was driven by growth. You can see the $115 million in volume and mix, most of that is volume and then we also benefited from favorable mix associated with leasing in North America. In terms of our guidance for the full year, we continue to expect Ford Credit profit to be about equal to higher than what it was last year. We have narrowed the range of our call for managed receivables to $124 billion to $127 billion still looking for $250 million of distributions from Ford Credit in the fourth quarter and we expect to temporarily see our managed leveraged little bit higher than the 8 to 9 to 1 target due to the translation effect of the strong U.S dollar. Okay, with that let\u2019s leave the business units and we will go on to cash and cash flow on Slide 18. Again I have touched on much of this so let me highlight once again the strong operating cash flow of $2.8 million, you can see that was driven by the automotive pre-tax profits, but we also saw some good performance in working capital and also other timing differences. Going down further on a page, you can see we actually had no pension contributions in the quarter to our funded plans. I talked about this earlier in the year I said that they would be \u2013 the contributions would be largely biased towards the first part of the year. We still have a couple hundred million dollars ahead of us that will be done in the fourth quarter ending the year with about $1.1 billion of contributions. We had $600 million in dividends in the quarter, $1.9 billion of shareholder distributions to date and since 2012 when we restored the dividend that we've had shareholder distributions of $8.5 billion dollars. Liquidity ended at $33.2 billion in the quarter very, very strong. Okay, let\u2019s turn to Slide 19 and look at our planning assumptions and key metrics. So at the top you can see industry volume and if you look at the third column there you can see as we usually do at this point in time, we\u2019ve narrowed our call to around a single point estimates so in the U.S. we are looking at 17.7 million units that would be up 5% from last year and in line with the year-to-date results. In Europe 20 about 16 million units that would be up 10% and again pretty much in line with the year-to-date results, and in the case of China, we were at 23 million to 24 million in the last call, we\u2019ve narrowed that now to 24 million based on the actions the government has taken which would be in line with where we were last year and a little bit higher than the year-to-date results. In terms of the financial results on the rest of the page everything remains on track and certainly I don\u2019t want to not state the fact that we expect to see the company coming with the pre-tax profits within the range that we\u2019ve had all year long of $8.5 million to $9.5 million. So overall very strong results for the quarter, for the year-to-date expecting a strong fourth quarter and the breakthrough year that we've been talking about since January. Mark Fields : And a couple of comments on the industry, the U.S. industry in particular before wrapping up. We would characterize the U.S. industry as healthy and borrowing any type of shock whether it would be economic or policy related. We do see industry sales staying well supported at the current levels through the next few years or in other words we expected to be stronger for longer. Transaction prices are strong across the industry and for us replacement demand is back to its historical level of about 70% of industry sales and when you combine that with the vehicle park age, the oldest it\u2019s ever been in 11.5 years, we think that bodes well. The labor market is steadily improving or seeing better wage and income growth and then when you look at the Full-Size Pickup segment which is important to us here in our biggest and most profitable market. 50% of Full-Size Pickups on the road today are 10 years or older and actually 25% of them are actually 20 years or older. So as we stand back across our lineup we think we are very well positioned overall and also with the F-150 and the 2016 launch of the new Super Duty coming down the pike. So let me just sum it all up. We had an outstanding third quarter and as we mentioned it was a record third quarter profit and with that higher wholesales revenue and market share and also better margin, and we are formally on track to deliver the breakthrough full-year. And for 2015, if you look at the regions we continue to expect North America to be very strong both in profit, but also substantial topline growth with margins in the upper end of 8.5% to 9.5% range that we\u2019ve guided to. As we look at Europe, we expect improvement in Europe, as we continue moving towards profitability and will have more to say about that in January. Our Middle East and Africa business unit will deliver breakeven results. South America will deliver better results than last year despite the much tougher environment we\u2019re seeing. And Asia-Pacific is going to have a strong year and in particularly strong fourth quarter and likely a record fourth quarter with the new capacity and the products that are coming online in combination with the government incentives promoting smaller vehicles in China and of course continued strong and steady returns from Ford Credit. And as we look at 2016, we expect a strong year with the momentum that we built in 2015 and particularly in the second half of 2015 we expect that to carryover into 2016. A little bit longer-term we\u2019re on track to deliver our strategic objectives, which are around being the top five in global sales having a better balance of profit and sales around the world, 8% plus operating margins being in the top quartile of total shareholder returns and being highly regarded by our stakeholders. So as you look at the third quarter we think there's more proof there that we have the right strategic framework, we have the right proven process and, of course, we have the right team and we\u2019re consistently delivering. So with that why don\u2019t we go to the phone lines for your questions? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed. Ryan Brinkman : My question, maybe first on Europe, I'm curious what you think the trend is going to be there between diesel and gas given the events since your last call. Can you talk about your mix of diesel versus gas in the region? Then I think, too, you have a higher mix of light commercial vehicles, which are generally diesel and are going to remain diesel, so can you maybe break that out for us without the impact of LCVs? I'm trying to understand if there were a shift towards gas in the region, if you would benefit from that. And then just on a similar note, I think there's an opportunity now for your prices in Europe to converge with Volkswagen's more quickly than maybe was earlier hoped for. That's a key long-term positive, but should we also worry that maybe their prices have to come down near-term pressure in the industry? Thanks. Mark Fields : Okay thanks, Ryan. Let me take the first part of that question. First off as a company we\u2019re well-positioned to respond to wherever the marketplace goes. If you look at some of the statistics our total sales in Europe are about 55% diesel. So it\u2019s slightly less than the total industry, but when you break that out our cars are about 44%, which is below the industry. We do have the capability to actually go up to about 80% of gas engine. So we have that flexibility and on the LCV side probably about 97% of our LCVs are diesel, but we see that continuing strong. It's really too early line Ryan, too early to tell what changes in the marketplace we will see. We have not seen any changes in terms of customer ordering, we've actually seen a little bit of uptick and interest on diesel on our build-and-price, Internet marketing tool that we have out there. And in terms of the pricing, again we\u2019re going to continue to come out with best-in-class products, we\u2019re seeing the strong pricing particularly across our vehicle lineup. As you noted from where Bob took you through, our pricing was positive across Europe. In terms of what some of our competitors will do, we don't know, we are just going to stay focused on our plan and keep driving the business forward. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, thanks. Then just for my last question maybe on Asia-Pacific. I think the guidance earlier in the year was that the profits would inflect from the first half to the back half as you launch new product and lever new facility investments. And since then you surprised with a really very strong 2Q and in the process were softer in 3Q; 4Q is going to be strong you say. I'm just curious what the biggest differences there have been, whether there was some sort of pull ahead maybe from 3Q to 2Q. And then just lastly, it looks like you actually increased here - am I right, you increased your market expectation for China? Now you're saying 24 million versus 23 million to 24 million? Mark mentioned the government tax incentives on 1.6 liter and below engines. Can you talk about, specific to those incentives, what percentage of your vehicles qualify for them, whether you've seen an uptick in your own sales since they've been announced? And then just lastly maybe high level, do you think that China has found a bottom here? Robert Shanks : I think I can remember maybe a third of that, so what it all cover just ask again Ryan. So, in terms of the counterization, I think you'll still see a stronger second half and then first half. And it\u2019s going to be driven by the fourth quarter, I think we probably would have expected third and fourth to be a little smoother than what it\u2019s going to be turn out. But that\u2019s because of the de-stocking action that we had to take in the third. We did that actually through the first and particularly in the second but the industry continued to slow a bit ahead of us keeping up with that. So we caught up in the third quarter. But now looking forward to a very strong fourth. We also were affected obviously in the third by the supplier constraint which isn\u2019t something that we had expected and some of that will get back in the fourth quarter as well. So that's really what's behind the counterization but generally if you talk at second half versus first half it will be consistent with what we said from the very being and one of the factors behind the companies that are second half and first half. Mark Fields : And just your question around what percent of our vehicles are available for the incentives 70%. And when you look at the engines we have in the small EcoBoost engines that we do have. We think we an opportunity there, in terms of how we reached the bottom, while what we\u2019ve seen is I mentioned in my remarks, we seen a stabilization. And I think the good news is we\u2019ve seen a bit of a stabilization on the passenger car market. And when you look at all the actions that the government has taken and the PBOC has taken over last number of months. We think that bodes well, so we think we found a bit of a bottom in passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles still a little bit of weakness there, that we\u2019re seeing persistent. And that will be a big determinant of where the economy is heading. But we\u2019re still seeing some weakness there. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. Very helpful, thanks. Congrats on the quarter. Mark Fields : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak of RBCC. Please proceed. Joseph Spak : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I first wanted to get a little bit of a better sense of the puts and takes for the fourth-quarter North America margins. You're showing production up 12%, but \u2013 and calling that the higher end of the range, but that would still be a step down from what you've done year-to-date, which I think was sort of 9.9%. So maybe you could give us first some of the offsets there. Robert Shanks : Yes, we have all the numbers you cited Joe are correct, 99, year-to-date the 111, second quarter 113, and the third I think we were 67 in the first, when we\u2019re still launching and launch of the F-150. We do think we\u2019ll come in at the upper end of that range, which would obviously suggest the fourth quarter that\u2019s going to be lower than we saw in the second and third and that\u2019s driven by normal seasonal factors. If you look at our business, year in and year out right across the board North America, other regions as well, we have cost increases on a sequential basis going from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And we expect to see that happen again this year. We will still see positive on a year-over-year basis expect to see positive top line in terms of volume, in terms of still see good mix, we will still see positive pricing but we will see that seasonal cost increase. The other thing I'll mention that's different this year than some other years is the fact that there are aspects of the UAW agreement once we conclude one that we will book in the fourth quarter. So for example if we were to have signing bonuses, which you know it looks like GM agreed to and FCA those would be booked in the quarter that the agreement is confirmed or ratified. So that would take place also in the fourth quarter. Joseph Spak : And that considered, I am sorry go ahead. Mark Fields : Joe just to put that in this perspective into the entire year, again in a year, in which we had a lot of launches and particular in the first half of the year launching the second plant for F-150, we are guiding to the upper half of 8.5% to 9%. So that gives you a little bit of perspective of the momentum as we get into 2016. Robert Shanks : Yes, on that point I mean if you look at North America from 2010 to 2014 it\u2019s averaged 9.1%. So I mean it looks like we have the chance of even doing better than that despite the launch is so effective as at the beginning of the year. Joe, you want to say something. Joe Spak : Yes, I was just going to ask any potential UAW agreement is considered in that guidance for the year? Mark Fields : Yes. Joe Spak : Okay. And South America, I know you talked about some positive stuff for Ford there, but obviously the commentary on the environment is a difficult one. I guess what I'm wondering is over the past four or five years you've done a pretty good job of pricing for some of the currency moves. And I guess what I'm wondering is if you're beginning to hit the limits of what you can do there, how have some of your recent pricing actions been received in that region? Mark Fields : Well, we would price more if the industry, but I mean that\u2019s really what needs to happen, there needs to be more aggressive pricing overall by everyone in the market because the impact of the depreciating currencies in the local inflation we just can't keep up with it. And we have been quite active on the pricing front, but it's just not been something that everyone. I think you\u2019ve got the number of players, particularly the larger players are trying to protect their market share positions and not responding to the forces that we are seeing. If you look at the rail for example over the last year it\u2019s depreciate by 63%. If you look at inflation in Brazil it\u2019s running about 10%, and in Argentina 15% to 27% depending upon whether it\u2019s the official inflation rate or the one that people actually live with. So I mean that\u2019s really what's happening is it's just the environment is really, really eating away at the overall cost positions that everybody has there and then the revenue that we are generating. Robert Shanks : Joe that being said when you look at our plan of introducing new product and the fact that we are able to gain 1.4 points of market share. When the economy does turn we think will be well-positioned on product standpoint from a cost standpoint and keep in mind before 2013 we had nine years of good profitability out of the region so we are taking a long view, but we also understand in the short to medium term it\u2019s going to be volatile and it\u2019s going to be challenging. Mark Fields : Just to underscore that, if you go to Slide 11 and you look at the contribution costs and structural costs which are netting to basically about nothing there together. There is about $100 million of inflation effects in those numbers so the teams actually delivered cost reductions of about $100 million just in a quarter on a year-over-year basis. So we are swimming hard, it\u2019s just occurrence quite strong against us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Please proceed. Colin Langan : Great, thanks for taking my question. On slide 9 you show net pricing and contribution costs. When I net them together it's fairly flat, slightly negative I guess. I'm a bit surprised given you talk about the F-150 had APPs up I think you said $2,800. You have the new Explorer, the Edge. Are you --? How should we think about net pricing going forward and sort of what is the drag in there that is preventing net pricing from being more positive? Robert Shanks : Yes, I don\u2019t think there is drag at all Colin and don\u2019t say what I said I think for two quarter in a row. When you look at the business, you got to look at the whole business and if you look at the volume and mix let\u2019s start there first. I just mentioned we were up over 100,000 units year-over-year in volume, 45,000 of that is F series so clearly a significant factor behind what you see on industry share stocks. And on mix and most of them 547 that you're looking at there is actually favorable mix and much of that is F series. So you have to look at the impact that the new product has on volume that it has on mix and that it got on net pricing and obviously it\u2019s a factor and net pricing is not the only factor. And on the contribution cost that\u2019s not all F series I mean you\u2019ve got Explorer, you have got Edge, you\u2019ve got a number of new products which also contributing to everything. So you really have to take all of that and you got to put it together and of course the result is a fantastic margin. Colin Langan : And There has been a lot of questions on the F-150. Can you clarify whether the new F-150 is more profitable than the outgoing model, given the higher aluminum cost, now that it's been in the market for a while? Robert Shanks : I would say what I said for like about a year and a half, the F-150 margins are very, very profitable and we are very satisfied with the contributions we are making to the overall business and the other thing I would remind everyone is that this is a positive contributor to are achieving a regulatory compliance on fuel economy which gives us options on other parts of our portfolios were developing those products. So the effects of the F-150 are very, very positive and/in of itself but also in other ways across other aspect of your business. Colin Langan : I know you're not going to talk about 2016, but your earlier comments talked about margins being at the high end of the range by H1's launch cost. How should we think about that, those costs into 2016, because you do have the Heavy Duty coming? Is that going to be flat year over year or is this still net down when we think about launching the next year? Robert Shanks : We'll talk about margins as well as other aspect of our guidance in the call in January. As Mark mentioned we're looking forward to a very strong 2016 for the company coming off of everything that we build this year. North America will have strong results there is - Super Duty launch next year, but that will be a more normal launch because we've got separate body shop, we are going to take all the actions that we need to take in regularly scheduled downtime as opposed to what we did in Dearborn in Kansas City. So it\u2019s a very different type of the launch and clearly benefiting from everything that we learned on the first two. So this we will not be the effect to that you saw with the F-150 will be a normal launch. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed. John Murphy : Just a first question, if we could maybe look on slide 9. One of the things that I think we were a little bit surprised at was the increase in structural costs and, to a lesser extent, contribution costs here. Can you just remind us how you are thinking about structural costs at this point and how you think about sort of your breakeven level relative to the US SAAR right now? Because it does seem like there's some costs that are creeping in here that we weren't really expecting. Mark Fields : Yes, did not creeping on your planned and if you think about what where thinking about the business we\u2019ve been talking for quite sometime about profitably growing the business. And where we see opportunities to invest in the business to do so and get an appropriate return on our invested capital we will. So hear what you see is investments that we\u2019re making and product, investments we\u2019re making in advertising sales promotion you have an increase in DNA as we ramped up our spending as the business is grown and we see opportunities to do so profitably going forward so all of that is necessary and supportive of the types of margins that were delivering. If you think about the breakeven we are retargeting I think we talked about this back on our Investor Day we\u2019re targeting to get to breakeven that's equivalent to two-thirds of our wholesale volume and that is exactly were North America. So everything is where it should be for North America and when we look ahead if we help opportunities to invest in the business and grow it in a possible way, but the appropriate returns we will do so. John Murphy : Okay, that's helpful. Then the second question : as you look at how the year has progressed here, Bob, it does sound like things have shifted a little bit and obviously you're still going to have second-half profits that are higher than first-half profits. But what do you think is sort of the major puts or headwinds that you are running into that are changing that a little bit? It just does seem like there's a little bit less optimism relative second half versus first half relative to where there was maybe at the beginning of the year? Robert Shanks : Well, John I am not sure why would say that we the year is playing out very much like we had expected we feel exactly - that where exactly were we thought we would be at the beginning of the year. We see the second half still being stronger as we had expected than the first half we delivered you know outstanding results in the second here we are in the third to fourth sequentially will be lower as it normally yes but on a year-over-year basis can be spectacular. We think that you\u2019re playing out exactly as we had that it was going to play out. John Murphy : But, Bob, you talked about sort of the seasonal pattern that was typical where the first half was stronger and the second half was weaker, and now it seems like you're pointing to seasonal factors in the fourth quarter putting pressure on North America, which is what you didn't say before. You actually said the second half would be -- was stronger and you wouldn't see the typical seasonal factors, so I think that's where things have changed a little bit relative to what we were expecting. It just seems like that's a change. Robert Shanks : Okay I respect and this agree why don\u2019t you go back and look at the graphic that we provide you'll see the second half was stronger than the first half you will see that the first quarter was the weakest quarter of the year and you'll see that the fourth quarter was trailing off a bit from the third quarter. That's exactly what's going happen. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner of CLSA. Please proceed. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi, good morning everybody. Mark Fields : Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner : Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask you just a little more color on these, the comments that you made on the Super Duty launch being more of a regular launch versus the F-150. I guess as we're trying to -- from our seat trying to understand through the implications of a launch and obviously some downtime next year, but then also potentially offset by additional strength on the F-150. What does a regular launch mean compared to what we saw in the F-150? Mark Fields : Well, Emmanuel what you saw on launch the F-150 is obviously we took significant downtime to completely rebuild the body shops. And what we\u2019ve been able to do with the spacing that we have in Kentucky or Kentucky truck operation, the body shop actually started being constructed in 2015 and it\u2019s going to be completed by the end of this year. So we won't have the extended downtime that we had in Dearborn Truck or in Kansas City. So overall, what we'll see is the typical model year changeover what that happens during the shutdown period over the vacations. So we won't see, we will see that\u2019s what we mean by a more normal launch, we handle it during the shutdown period during the vacations and they are more up and running. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, that's helpful. Two quick questions on the North American volume in the quarter. On the production side, it looks like you produced maybe 5% fewer vehicles than you had guided just three months ago. I'm curious where that comes from. And then when I look at your earnings contribution from volume and mix in the quarter in North America, obviously very strong, $1.6 billion. Divided by the delta in wholesales looks like it's $16,000 contribution margin per vehicle or so when you said that only about half of the increase is the F-Series. So can you maybe explain the high contribution? Mark Fields : Yes, the contribution margin that you are seeing is because we have a number of very high margin products that we have been launching and Explorer, which is very high margin edge, which was really coming out in the quarter very strongly because we had launched I think in the prior quarter, that\u2019s a very high margin product. And of course Mustang, Mustang is doing extremely well too. So you've got a lot of very high margin products that were driving that increase and generating type margins that you are seeing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. Rod Lache : I wanted to also ask you about that. On slide 9, the North American bridge, typically you provide the material ex commodities, the commodity, and the warranty items for the contribution costs. I didn't see that this time for the segment. You had it for the overall company. I was hoping you could get that and, more specifically, I believe that there was a $500 million warranty charge last year. So is the \u2013 and I'm assuming that that's in the year-over-year comparison. So is the contribution cost actually more like $927 million ex that or is that $427 million really the contribution costs year over year? So is the and I'm assuming that said in the year-over-year comparison, so is the contribution cost actually more like 927 X that or is that 427 really the contribution cost year-over-year? Mark Fields : Yes, Rod, if you were to look at the company, Slide which is back on Slide 6, those the callout explanation are very much the North American callout explanations, you know if you just factor them down very slightly, that\u2019s basically what you would see in the case of North America. So North America in terms of material excluding commodities would be the $1.1 billion, the commodity is about $325 million the structural related cost about $320 million. So you can see the North American results very, very much mapping to the total company and the case of warranty we saw good news of about $340 million year-over-year in North America. So that's exactly what you're talking about, we did have some reserve adjustments that we normally make in the third quarter that\u2019s when we do our deep dives particularly on both coverages. I think and also field service actions that we also have the one time action last year, which obviously didn\u2019t have this year. So it\u2019s a good news and that\u2019s really what's behind that 418 that you see on Slide 6. Rod Lache : Okay thanks, that's helpful. I was hoping you could just comment on going forward, one of your competitors recently suggested that they may be able to mitigate regulatory cost inflation through 2018. Just given that you already absorbed a lot with F-Series to help you guys achieve some of these targets longer-term, is that something that you think Ford can achieve? Mark Fields : Well, we are not talking about forward years today I mean we did have our Investor Day some time ago, we talked about the fact that particularly towards the end of the decade, if you look 2019 and 2020 I mean I think there's a lot of work the whole industry is got to do at that point in time in response to your compliance particularly around the machines and fuel economy, but I think we feel good about where we are up until 2019, but then there is a sort of a step level increase and we are all going to have to continue to work on particularly with more electrification that\u2019s going to be required in that timeframe. Rod Lache : Okay, just one last one if I can sneak it in. You provide all the buckets for the Asia bridge, and I was wondering if you might be able to just give us a sense of how -- if we were just to think about China specifically, how would the bridge be bucketed? What would the structural costs be doing? What is pricing doing on a year-to-year basis as we look at Q3? Mark Fields : Yes, we are not going to breakout individual markets within a region, but I think it would be fair to say that in general because we do include on an equity after-tax basis the year-over-year variances from the China JVs within these data that you are seeing on Slide 16 and you could imagine that a lot of that is going to be driven by China just because of the size of that business within Asia Pacific. So I think you're probably looking at China, when you are looking at the slide here for the most part. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Adam Jonas : Hey Mark, hey Bob. Mark Fields : Hey. Adam Jonas : So Toyota recently made a statement in the media in Tokyo that it expects sales of gasoline and diesel engine cars will be, they said, near zero by the year 2050. Now I know 35 years is a long time, but is that crazy? What do you think of that forecast? Mark Fields : Well, I can't speak to some of my competitors, in terms of our business plan that's a long business plan I mean we\u2019d have to look out, but our plan as you know Adam very simply is provide the power of choice to consumer so we have terrific internal combustion engines, electrification and we all the different variants are working on hydrogen fuel cells et cetera. We have great diesel engines and our approach going forward is fuel economy is important to customers and so machines and things of that nature and we are going to continue to provide that choice and products that will appeal to our customers that are interested in those things and those are the things that they are interested in and we are going to continue to work at it. Adam Jonas : Great, Mark. Maybe nearer term, and this is something I think I asked you about at the Detroit show almost a year ago, the topic of active safety and tying in life-saving and accident-prevention technologies, software and sensors and things, that also happen to make cars more fuel efficient. Any update on your progress of how Ford and some of your competitors have been able to convince the regulators that, look, these things should actually start getting some credit on the fuel economy side? Mark Fields : Well, from our standpoint we are actively engaged with the regulators and it\u2019s an active ongoing discussion. We share the same objectives. We want to reduce the number of accidents. We want to reduce the number of fatalities. We want to loss congestion and we want to improve just overall safety for our customers. So we are in active discussions right now I think the things that you mentioned are things that we are talking to them about, because we feel they do require consideration and we'll see when we come out on those discussions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stover of FIG. Please proceed. Matt Stover : Thank you very much. A question about Asia-Pacific. It's been some time here where one hand off or the other hand took China down, but it's doing pretty well. It's doing about $1.2 billion in profit, but the other APAC businesses are losing about $1.2 billion annualized. And I guess I kind of understand the story in China, but I'm wondering how we should think about those other losses outside of China that are dragging down the results within the region. Robert Shanks : Well, let me first start with China you're only looking at the China joint ventures. We have three other areas of our business in China that would come to what we would call China as we\u2019re looking at it internally. So you\u2019ve got the built-up imports that we send them to China from on the Ford brand we've got the Lincoln products that were also exporting into China and as you might expect since we\u2019re in the process of just launching that brand and launching the network and the products that is not this year contributing positively to profits. And then we've also got engineering costs that were incurring today inside Ford that we will only receive compensation for in future years once we start building the vehicles that were engineering. So that\u2019s a cost if you will that we incur until that point in time. So you have to look at all of that in order to have a complete view of what our profitability is inside China. So looking at the JVs is going to give you not a complete understanding of what that story is. If you look at the rest of the region, the rest of the region for the last two quarters this quarter in the second quarter actually has improved on a year-over-year basis and was pretty flat in the first quarters. So the efforts that we have underway. In India, Australia and ASEAN are making great progress in terms of getting those businesses where they need to be. In the case of Australia we would expect that inflection point if you will to occur when we close our manufacturing facility there in October of next year and teams doing a very, very good job of repositioning the brand and the product lineup to prepare for that. In the case of India we just launched the brand-new Sanand facility and the new product that that we are building there, the Figo and that\u2019s off to a good start, but there will be a while before as we have add product and add volume there to get the plant up and running to the level that we expected to be. And then in the case of ASEAN we actually made very good progress in ASEAN in terms of getting that region back to profitability and the sort of skirting around the level at the moment. So we feel really good about the progress you're making it more work to do and we expect about to contribute positively in the relatively near future. So those are the three areas and again all progressing very nicely and all contributing positively on a year-over-year basis. China is the reason why the region declined year-over-year both in the third quarter and the second quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Patrick Archambault : Great, thanks for squeezing me in here. A couple of clarifications, just one I think it might've been Emmanuel's question, and forgive me if that was answered. But I think there was a question about the shipments being different in 3Q for North America relative to what was originally guided for. What was the reason for that? Was that some of the ramp stuff that we have -- some of the ramp challenges with frames that we've been reading about or is there something else that led to that difference? Mark Fields : Thanks its from a production standpoint what we ran into Patrick was a supplier related production disruption and we are now through that, but it did impact or production in North America and it did impact our production in China, but as I said were through that but is not related to F-150 as you see actually our production in F-150 came just about bang on what we expected. So it was some other vehicles some of our utilities that impacted a number of our clients. Patrick Archambault : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Then just while we're on the same topic of North America, a lot of time is spent on slide 9, but the net pricing piece just taking that on its own. It is down -- the year-on-year increase is down from the second quarter, where I think it was around $700 million if I'm remembering correctly. Is this kind of for the fourth quarter the new run rate of pricing, or is this something that could pop up back towards that previous increase? Just the thing that comes to mind is there was at least one month in the quarter where incentives were pretty big on the F-150, and I feel like they moderated after that. So just wanted to try and put those things together. Mark Fields : So Patrick just to be clear you're talking about sequentially second quarter to third quarter in North America. Yes, if your question was the second quarter to third quarter change we had lower volume was down about 45,000 units and again that's because of some plant shutdowns that we have in the summer. Operator : We will now take questions from the media community and your next question comes from the line of David Shepardson of Detroit News. Please proceed. David Shepardson : Thanks for having the call. Mark, I wonder if you would like to respond to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who over the last six months has been heavily critical of Ford's announced plans to expand its investments in Mexico that the $2.5 billion and could you just sort of address generally whether you think it\u2019s appropriate to be investing in Mexico in response to suggestions that Ford should be spending more resources here in the U.S.? Mark Fields : Thanks Dave. Well, listen as we\u2019ve said we have not talked to Donald Trump and we have not made any changes to our manufacturing plants. And Dave as a company we deal with the facts and facts are stubborn things and Ford were proud of the facts and unfortunately we suspect the facts are getting lost in the politics. The reality and the facts are that we've invested more than $10 billion in the U.S. in our plants since 2011 and we've also added 25,000 U.S. employees. When you look at the way we spent our investments 80% of our North American investments are here in the U.S. and 97% of our engineering is done here in the U.S. We are multinational company and we invest in all the markets we do business in and you just saw the numbers here in the U.S., we\u2019ve been in Mexico for 90 years. And this kerfuffle that we've seen yesterday around F-650 and our F-750 and what\u2019s going on, we did resource them from Mexico to Ohio. We made that decision back in 2011 and that was long before any candidates announced their intention to run for U.S. President. As a matter of fact that was made before the last Presidential Election. So those are the facts we don't as we look at that we don't \u2013 facts don't cease to exist because they're ignored, but those are the facts at Ford and we are very proud of the fact of what we do in terms of driving, doing our part to drive the economic development in the U.S. and many other markets we do business around the world. End of Q& A Operator : At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ted Cannis. Please proceed sir. Ted Cannis : Mark, Bob, anything you want to say to wrap up? All right, thanks very much everybody, and information will be out on the websites. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

So presenting today are Mark Fields, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks our Chief Financial Officer and also participating are Stuart Rowley, Vice President and Controller; Neil Schloss, Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Global Accounting; and Marion Harris, Ford Credit CFO. Mark over to you. Mark Fields : Okay. Thanks Ted. And good morning everybody and thanks for joining us. I'm really pleased to review with you our 2015 full year and our fourth quarter results. And if you recall, last year on this call we promised a breakthrough year in 2015 and we delivered. We achieved a record company full year pretax profit of $10.8 billion. Looking at the business units, every business unit with the exception of South America was profitable. In Europe, we returned to profitability and we earned over $1.25 billion. That reflects the progress of our transformation plan. Asia Pacific had its best ever annual profit and of course North America and Ford Credit continue to deliver strong profitability for the company. We also generated our highest volume in 10 years and the most revenue in 12 years and our automotive operating-related margin came in at 6.8% and that was the highest since at least the 1990s. And in automotive-related operating cash flow, we came in at $7.3 billion and that was the best that we generated since 2001. We also at the same time grew our global market share and that's in large part due to the strength of our new products and a little bit of a sampling of that Explorer remained the best selling three-row SUV in the world. Mustang, which as you know we took global last year is the world's best selling sports car. F Series is America's best selling pickup for 39 straight years and the bestselling vehicle for 34 years in a row. We're also again America's bestselling vehicle brand for the sixth straight years and in Europe, we became the number one commercial vehicle brand and that's the first time we've been able to achieve that in 18 years. And turning to Lincoln, we delivered a second straight of U.S. sales growth and we also became the first luxury brand in China to top 10,000 sales in its first full year of operation. And of course along with this strong performance, we rewarded our shareholders with distributions totaling $2.5 million during the year and also growing our regular dividend by 20%. And I strongly believe that these results once again demonstrate that our plan, our people and our process are delivering and they're creating value for our stakeholders. Now, looking at the fourth quarter on the next slide, you can see it was another terrific quarter that helped contribute to our performance for the year. Our fourth quarter pretax profit of $2.6 billion was nearly double a year ago. Our net income came in at $1.9 billion and our automotive operated margin came in at 6.1% and that was up 2.7 percentage points from last year. Importantly, we also delivered strong topline growth with our wholesale volume and automotive revenue both up 12% and revenue was up 18% at constant exchange and we generated strong automotive operating-related cash flow of $2.1 billion for the quarter. We were profitable in all business units, except South America, including a record profit in Asia Pacific, a fourth quarter record in North America and another solid quarter from our Ford Credit operations and in Europe we delivered our third consecutive profitable quarter. So in sum, our profits improved, our market share improved and our margins improved delivering profitable growth for all of our stakeholders and we're also guiding to achieve equally strong or better results this year. Now, turning to Slide 4, 2015 was also a year of progress from an operating point as well. We successfully completed the 16 global launches that we planned. We improve quality and customer satisfaction around the world as we launched those products and we continue to invest for profitable growth in the future. And I believe of all our accomplishments, one of the most significant was delivering such strong results in the near term while expanding our business model for the future and we're growing and investing to be both an auto and a mobility company. ' And what this means is we're strengthening and investing in core business of designing, developing, manufacturing, marketing, financing and servicing great cars, trucks, SUVs and electrified vehicles. But also at the same time, we're aggressively pursuing emerging opportunities through Ford Smart Mobility with the most recent announcement of SYNC Connect and our plan to have the largest autonomous vehicle test fleet in the industry. And we're also working to transform the automotive customer experience with the introduction of FordPass. And as we do all of this, we're going to stay absolutely focused on accelerating the pace of progress of our One Ford Plan, delivering product excellence with passion and driving innovation in every part of the business. So with that I'll, turn it over to Bob, who will take us through some of the financial results. Bob Shanks : Thanks Mark. What I'd like to do is to start on Slide 5, which is our key financial summary. And the first thing I would ask you to do is just glance down the second and the fourth columns. Those are the year-over-years for the fourth quarter and the full year and what you'll see is everything is positive. So whether it's the growth factor, it's the operating results or the net income factors, cash liquidity, everything better than in 2015, whether the quarter or the full year. Now certainly we should recognize that, and we\u2019ll talk about it later in the presentation that we\u2019re seeing strong improvement from across most parts of the business, in fact all parts of the business in terms of the full year and we should recognize too that we\u2019re benefitting from the big bet that we made on the F-150. We had the launch effects of that in 2014 and including in the fourth quarter and that was a big bet for the company and it's paying off for us. It\u2019s certainly resonating with customers. It\u2019s good for the environment and certainly as I said we\u2019re reaping the rewards of that. Since I\u2019m going to touch on most of these things in the subsequent comments and slides, I just want to highlight three things that I won't come back to later. The first down the page under operating results, let\u2019s look at our earnings per share and operating basis, you can see that we came in at $0.58, which is up 93% from a year ago and $1.93 which is up 44%. Go down a bit further and look at the after-tax results, net income you can see we came in at the quarter at $1.9 billion that was up very sharply from a year ago and $7.4 billion for the full year up $6.1 billion. If you go up just a couple lines from there you can see the special items pre-tax charges in the quarter, we have $714 million that was almost completely explained by the re-measurement losses on our pension and OPEB plans. Okay, let\u2019s go on to Slide 6, I\u2019ve got three slides for the full year I\u2019d like to touch on those first and then we\u2019ll get into more details of the quarter. These are the absolutes of the quarter and you can see the record of $10.8 million and then as you glance across the segments, you can see everything that\u2019s profitable in terms of the business units with the exception of South America. And if you look at the operations outside of North America collectively we made $223 million. To me the big story and one of the big stories that we want to get across today is the quality of the improvement across the business on a year-over-year basis. If you look below the charge you can see the changes. The $3.57 billion improvement at the company level, it was driven by North America $1.9 billion of financial services, a contributor over $200 million but we got $1.4 billion of improvement from the operations outside North America and going forward our whole strategy is to keep North America strong, strengthen it to the extent that we can. But it\u2019s really the other operations we need to get them moving forward in a positive direction both in terms of profitability and returns that\u2019s the big opportunity for us as well as the new opportunities and you can see we made great progress on that in the full year and I\u2019ll touch on that in the quarter as well. Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 7 and here we'll look at the key metrics for the company. This is the automotive sector for the full year. So just kind of looking across the page; wholesale is up 5%, revenue up 4%, 9% at constant exchange, very strong improvement in the operating margin 6.8% and the pre-tax results up 60%. And on the lower left, you can see the global market share which is up two tenths that was in South America and Europe and some favorable geographic mix effects as well. Let\u2019s go on to Slide 8 and here we will look at the full year improvement. You can see $3.3 billion that was driven by $7.4 billion of improvement and market factors, volume, mix, net pricing all driving that in the positive direction. We did have cost increases, both contribution cost and structural cost. The one thing I\u2019d like to highlight here we\u2019ve broken out for the first time manufacturing and engineering separately and you can see with the manufacturing call out, that we\u2019ve also indicated that it includes volume related effects. Some companies include variable and labor and overhead in volume, but we don\u2019t do that. We put all that in structural cost, which is why we don\u2019t call it fixed cost because we recognize that the downturn we\u2019re able to respond appropriately whether it\u2019s taking over time out, shifts, lines to be changed and so forth. And so hopefully that will help to understand better the cost and the nature of the cost that we're investing in the business. On the far right, you can see the ratification bonus related to the UAW agreement. I should note that within the results and all this sits in North America, we\u2019ve got about $600 million of cost increases associated with the agreement. Most of that is the one-time ratification bonus. The rest of it is just normal cost increases related to wage increases and so forth and that\u2019s sitting in our structural cost. All right. Now let\u2019s move into the fourth quarter. I will start by looking at the absolutes on Slide 9, again very strong performance $2.6 billion and again glance across the page and you can see everything profitable with the exception of South America and again the collected results of the operations outside North America of profit of nearly $300 million. Again I want to highlight the story year-over-year, go below the chart first line, $1.3 billion, $400 million from North America about a $130 million from financial services, but more than 50% or $760 million coming from the operations outside of North America, again demonstrating the progress that we\u2018re making in getting the company more balanced in terms of the contributions around the world. Now let\u2019s move to the key metrics on Slide 10, again growth in wholesale is double digits, same thing in revenue of 18% a constant exchange, a good margin for the fourth quarter of 6.1% and pretax results have more than doubled and on the lower left, you can see our global market share was flat. Let\u2019s go on to Slide 11, and here we'll look at the change in our automotive sector results year-over-year up $1.1 billion. Very similar pattern to what we saw in the full year, very strong market factors. We had cost increases again look at the structural cost, you can see the manufacturing of 23.5. Almost all of that is volume related. The balance is explained by the UAW contract and then the gratification bonus to the far right. Okay. Let's go on to North America and here we'll start going through the business units. These are the key metrics. North America had very strong growth in the quarter. It was their best quarter of growth of the year. You can see wholesale is up 15%, revenue up probably nearly 20%. The operating margin very, very good at 8.2% traditionally for the fourth quarter is our weakest quarter and this includes the full $600 million of UAW related cost. So really strong result from North America and you can see the profits of $2.1 -- or $2 billion of 26%.  You go below the chart you can see the full year, very strong factors right across the Board and again the margin came in at 10.2%. As we look at the guidance for the year we expect to sustain this level of benchmark profitability with margins about around where we actually ended up about 9.5% or higher. But I thought I would comment on this because it was certainly something that was discussed quite a bit at the Deutsche Bank conference earlier in the month when we provided our guidance. Let me just again put into context how we're seeing the North American business. It is performing and has been performing for years at benchmark levels of profitability and margins and then as we've mentioned in three of the last four years other than the year when we launched that F-150, its been operating at 10% or higher, which actually is at the high end of the range that we're targeting on an ongoing basis of 8% to 10%. Then in 2016 we expect the margins again to be in this range 9% or higher but unlike in 2015 when the year-over-year growth in the market factors far exceeded the cost increases, we expect to see a smaller improvement in the market factors while we'll continue to invest for profitable growth and this is reflecting mainly three factors. The first is the fact that we will see much less benefit in '16 from industry growth in the U.S. The second one is that we are expecting impact of the super duty launch, which takes place in the second half to have an impact. Now we've target a normal launch, but it\u2019s still going to incur cost associated with such a large launch and we're going to have the normal volume ramp up curve that we have to climb. So it will have an effect primarily in the third quarter. And as mentioned lastly, we're continuing to invest for profitable growth this year and beyond not only in the traditional business, the core business, but also as we transformed Ford into an auto and a mobility company. So that\u2019s how we see it. We're very pleased with the results. We think we\u2019re going to sustain this level of profitability as we move into 2016. Okay let's go to the following slide on Slide 13 and let\u2019s look at what happened in the quarter for North America, an improvement of $400 million strong market factors. Cost increasing related to the products which also drove the market factors, but also the structural cost, which were largely volume related and the UAW agreement with the ratification bonus also having effect which is over in other. Mark Fields : And when you look at just a couple of comments we're coming off a strong year for Ford in the U.S. and as Bob mentioned earlier in terms of the investments, one of the stories within here is our new products have enabled strong pricing power with our transaction prices up over $2,200 versus last year and that was more than double the industry increase. And going forward this year, we're going to continue to focus on profitable growth while at the same time launching some very important high volume products like the Escape, the Fusion and as Bob mentioned the Super Duty. Let\u2019s turn now to South America on Slide 14, there is a lot of very big macro trends that are sweeping across the global economy and certainly the strong dollar commodity -- weak commodity cycle is one and there is probably no region that\u2019s more affected by this than South America and you can see it clearly in our results in the fourth quarter and the full year. You can see the wholesales were down sharply 39%. The revenue was actually down 52%, about 45% of that was related to weaker currencies. Margin of course down sharply and the results were down as well. If you look at the fourth quarter the same-store EBIT, when you get to the full year, you can see that we actually had an improvement in the results and that was related to the fact that we have a non-refit of the big Venezuelan devaluations in 2014. In terms of guidance, as we mentioned we expect our guidance or our guidance for that region is that it will be loss in 2016 and likely to be greater than what you're seeing today for 2015. Okay, let\u2019s move on to South America on a year-over-year basis, down $108 million and if you look at the callout box on volume and mix you can see that it's more than explained by the industry decline. We had a 33% reduction in the Brazil industry in the quarter. Clearly we had a impact on the business, but I will tell you our team did a great job of doing what they can do with the things they can control. We had a strong pricing. We had very favorable results in terms of cost performance and I would highlight that within these positive cost factors we have you have over $100 million of negative impact from the very high inflation that we're seeing in Brazil and in Argentina. And then lastly I would call out the exchange we had over $100 million of bad news that came from the devaluation of the Argentinean Peso that came towards the end of the year as new governments started to take action to restructure the economy so it's good for the longer term of Argentina but certainly hurt the business in the fourth quarter. Bob Shanks : Okay, let\u2019s turn to Europe now which is a very good story around the progress that the team is making there. In the fourth quarter, we were profitable. That's the third consecutive quarter of profitability. We had the strongest growth among the business units in Europe in the fourth quarter. It was up 21% and wholesale is up 19% if your whole exchange constant and of course we returned to profitability with a positive margin. And the story on a full year basis is just as good. We had growth although revenue was down if you adjust for exchange it was actually up 8% and then of course the profit that Mark mentioned of $259 million. Now if you look in the lower left, you can see we also grew share in Europe. We were up six tenths of a point across the entire region that was driven by Britain and Germany and some favorable impact of the geographic mix of the markets. And we also had favorable market share among the Europe 20 and that was driven by good performance of the Mondeo and the Eco Sport. In terms of guidance for 2016 we expect the results for Europe to be higher than what they were in 2015. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 17 and here we'll look at the year-over-year improvement on the quarter from Europe. So up $428 million and going across the page most everything positive we had favorable volume and mix. We had higher net pricing. We had lower cost and if you go to the far right the other is largely the effect of the consolidation of our Ford Sollers and City in Russia. So really, really strong performance right across the Board in Europe. Mark Fields : And just to jump in here for a second, obviously we're pleased with our progress in Europe, but not satisfied and we just want to be clear that getting profitable in Europe is just the first step and our goal is to deliver a sustainable and a vibrant business despite the competitive and regulatory pressures that we're seeing and also the difficult business conditions in Russia. Bob Shanks : Okay. Let\u2019s go into Middle East and Africa. This is the only slide we have for this region. You can see we had growth in the quarter. We also had positive results and for the full year we had a profit of $31 million as the team continues to start to unfold the growth strategy that they developed put in place last year. As we move into 2016 we expect the results to be about the same if not better in Middle East and Africa. Let\u2019s go into Slide 19 and turn to Asia Pacific, great story here. Wholesales were up sharply 16%, the revenue was up 38% if you adjust for exchange, a very strong operating margin and record pretax results in the quarter. If you look at the numbers below the chart, which are the full year somewhat quite as strong growth because the fourth quarter was clearing the big quarter of the growth in 2015. Very strong margin of over 7% and that record profit that we talked about earlier. On the lower left you can see the share in China was flat but we did improve the share overall across the region and that was largely due to favorable geographic mix. In terms of guidance, we\u2019re expecting results in 2016 to be even better than that were in 2015. Let\u2019s go to Slide 20 and we'll look at the improvement in the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific which was quite strong $349 million was largely driven by volume and mix and you can see it was industry a bit of share which is again geographic mix favorable stocks as the industry grew and we also got new products into the pipeline and the mix was very, very strong. Within this mix and other of $181 million you actually had $355 million of favorable mix that was largely the effect of the Edge which is hot and high margin, as well as good performance of the Mondeo and the Kuga. And you can see that the cost were pretty much flat and over to far right you can see other that is largely the royalties in China, so volume related as well. So very strong performance across the region and setting us up for another record in 2016. Mark Fields : And just focusing on China for a second, we delivered record sales in 2015 and we saw growth across the country, but the fastest growth actually occurred in the Tier 4 through six cities and as we started out this year what we're seeing is industry retail sales in January have started strong. They look to be in line with the sales rate that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015 although they're moderating in the second half of the month versus the first half. But just a note to point out that as you know the Chinese New Year is very variable. Some years it falls in January, some years it fall in February. So we're really going to need to look at how sales perform across January and February to get a clearer view of how the industry is tracking. Bob Shanks : Okay. Let's turn now to Ford Credit and on Slide 21 we've actually created a new slide. We wanted to be able to show you the absolutes that are important to the Ford Credit operations. On the far left, you can see a couple of growth metrics around contract volume, which was up 8% in the quarter. Managed receivables grew 12% as Ford Credit supported for its growth overall. Pretax result of $556 million that was up 31% and then we've got three metrics, which just represent the portfolio performance, which continues to be very strong and very robust and for those of you that want to understand more of course you can call into the fixed income call, which will take place later today and our team will take you through more insights and details into Ford Credit's performance, but the portfolio performance continues to be at very, very good levels and in fact compared to history low levels. If you look at the data below the chart, again growth across the Board there whether its volume or managed receivables of the profit of $2.1 billion and again look at those portfolio performance metrics are looking quite good and this is simply because Ford Credit has got a very clear point of view around its purchase polices. It\u2019s been implementing those very consistently for a number of years. So for example in terms of high risk business continues to be about 5% to 6% of the portfolio and its performing very well as the data indicates. What I want to highlight on the left and I am not going to talk about it until I get to the next slide, but look at the debt $120 billion to support Ford Credit and the managed leverage of 9.5 to 1. We target 8 to 9 to 1. It's above that level because of the effect of the strong dollar as it translates the equity of our operations outside of United States. In terms of guidance, we expect Ford Credit to continue to be strong performer about the same if not better in 2016 than it was in 2015. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 22 and we'll look at the fourth quarter and year-over-year performance. Ford Credit, you can see that it was driven by the growth, the volume, favorable mix across the globe in terms of the products and services that it provides and favorable financing margin, which came from lower borrowing cost. With that let\u2019s go into Slide 23 and we'll look at automotive sector cash and cash flow. This was a really great story in the quarter and also for the full year. If you go about a third way down the page, you can see the $2.1 billion of automotive operating cash flow the quarter, driven by the profits. And if you look at the full year the $7.3 billion record at least of 2001 again driven by the very strong profits and then you can see the uses of the cash flow there. On the lower left, you can see we ended the year at $34.5 billion of liquidity, a very strong level and then the automotive debt of $12.8 billion. I just want to stop by here because one of the things I just wanted to take a minute and comment on, we\u2019d seen a number of articles that continue to be written about the very high leverage of Ford Motor Company and generally that point of view is because people are taking this automotive debt, they're adding it to the financial services debt, which is on a previous page and of course the business will look for how to leverage. But that\u2019s not the way that investors should look at. It's also not the way that the credit rating agencies look at it. If you think about Ford Credit, Ford Credit is self funding, Ford Credit also self liquidates in a downturn at lower volume. And so you think about Ford Credit separately and then in terms of its own leverage you want to look at that managed leverage that I touched on and as I mentioned we've historically been within the 8% to 9% we target. A little bit above because of the translation effect in '15. but we're going to go back into a range in 2016. The key one in terms of the leverage of the company and the one that the credit rating agencies look at is this what's on this page, the $12.8 million and this is the lowest it's been since 2000 and its representative of a very good leverage position by the company along with where we stand on pensions and other things that the credit rating agencies look at. So we're in great shape in terms of the balance sheet but I just wanted to clarify that for everyone who had any questions about that. Okay I\u2019m going to wrap up on Slide 24 and this is looking at the planning assumptions and key metrics that we provided at the beginning of the year, and what I'll say is we delivered. If you go to the very bottom of the Slide, you can see a new metric that we've added that we disclosed at the Deutsche Bank Conference earlier this month, which is our after-tax five-year average return on invested capital. We came in and at 16% 2015, which was unchanged from 2014 and in both years well above the cost of capital. So Mark back to you to talk about '16 and wrap it up. Mark Fields : Okay, thanks Bob. So as you go on Slide 25 here you can see the company guidance is unchanged from the outlook that we provided on January 12, and we expect 2016 to be another strong year for the company, one that features obviously sustained strong financial performance and returns, profitability across all parts of our business, except south America, a continued strong balance sheet and of course the next stage in the deployment of our shareholder distribution strategy. Now as always for our process, we're going to continue to monitor the business environment to anticipate or react to any changes that we see and take appropriate action. So to sum it up, before we get to the Q&A, we promised and we delivered on our commitments for 2015. We promised to restructure and invest in our operations around the world and we delivered both topline and bottom line growth. And this year our commitment is to accelerate our pace of progress even further by building on our strengths, but also we're growing lean. We're going to be focusing obviously on profitability and making tough choices to restructure where necessary. We're moving fast to expand our business model and we're on track to deliver both our near and our long term strategic objectives. And our commitment quite simply is to deliver continued strong results in 2016 and expand our business model to take advantage of the huge opportunities in the changing world. So with that, why don\u2019t we just open the phone lines for your questions? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good morning, guys. Mark Fields : Good morning. John Murphy : Just a first question on cash flow, which was obviously very strong for the fourth quarter and for the full year, Bob as we look at the pretax profit that you\u2019re looking at for the total company is going to be flat on a year to year basis. So I would imagine that's -- or up, but that\u2019s not going to have too big an impact that would be negative on free cash flow in 2016. So why the same or lower for the free cash flow number for 2016? Is there something else going on below the line that either benefited on in '15 that would be a headwind in '16? Bob Shanks : Yes thanks John. That\u2019s a good question. Yeah there are two things to think about in terms of our call for 2016 and one of them is exactly what you mentioned. If you look and I am on Slide 23 here, if you look at the cash flow for the full year, you can see a favorable change in working capital and what we benefitted from was the fact that in 2014 we had the launch of the F-150 and there is a launch effect at the end of the year as well. So we had a drain down if you will that was unusual of working capital. We kind of restored that, replenished that in 2015 and benefitted from that. That does not obviously repeat in 2016. So that\u2019s one of the factors. The other factor on the slide you can see favorable other than timing differences and at least based on what we're seeing right now for '16, we don\u2019t think we're going to benefit same degree in that area of the cash flow statement as well. So those are the two factors that are causing us at this time to say that it will still be strong yet not as strong as what you\u2019re seeing here on Slide 23. So I think you can get a sense that it's going to be a good number, but just not at the level that we're seeing right now. Now of course we're going to continue to work to try to get everything out that we can and we will update you in the year if things change. John Murphy : Thank incredibly helpful. The second question just APAC, it seems like you it a real inflection point here in the fourth quarter. It was like a very significant step up on year-over-year basis but more important on a run rate basis. Is there anything that would change going forward here in the near turn? Just mitigate that step up because it is a big factor in the quarter. Bob Shanks : John when you look at the run rate of the fourth quarter, so your question was for 2016, a couple of things, one is as you know in the fourth quarter we do have higher dealer stocks due to the seasonal increases as we prepare for the Chinese Lunar New Year selling season. Also we had a few product launches. So were stocking up on that. Obviously we have to keep an eye on, on what\u2019s happening with the Renminbi in terms of the currency that\u2019s impacting us. And of course we're going to continue to have investments particularly engineering in for new products, but also to meet the regulatory requirements. So we expect as you saw from the guidance to do better in Asia Pacific in 2016, but hopefully that gives you a little flavor of the run rate going in. John Murphy : That's helpful and then just lastly, Brazil seems to be holding up very well for you and the industry. Obviously that's important for FMCC, but it\u2019s also very important for pricing on the new vehicle side. What are you seeing on residuals and as we see this continent march on product cadence just ramping up, how important it is to keep supporting your residuals and how do you see that impacting pricing for the new vehicles? Marion Harris : Hey John this is Marion Harris. Residual prices recently or our auction values have been holding up pretty well. We've seen a little bit of weakness recently, but nothing material. And I think, as we look forward, with the growth in leasing over the last number of years, we do expect to see some higher auction volume coming through over the coming years and as such, we baked in or have planned some expectation lower used vehicle prices. John Murphy : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Okay. Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Please go ahead. Colin Langan : Great, thanks for taking my question. One of the big highlights today seems to be the opportunity to see profits improve around the rest of the world. Can you remind us of the longer term targets you have in those major regions like Europe. And I guess the attention may have changed from the last update a couple of years ago and then particularly Asia ex China, when do you think to maybe get that back to profitability? Mark Fields : We would expect Europe to get to sort of a 6% to 8% margin, that\u2019s what we're targeting. If you think about Asia Pacific, there I think it would be 8% or maybe it\u2019s a bit higher because you've got the effect of the JV net income with no equity. So actually it could even be higher than that. Do you remember Stuart? Stuart Rowley : It's more like over 10%. Mark Fields : Over 10% on the basis that we report and then in case of South America, I would just go back to what we did, the previous nine years before this particular downturn started. We got very healthy margins there. So I think I would expect to see the same type of margins, but you have to think about South America over big cycles. You don\u2019t look at it year-by-year so much as you think about okay what did I get over these nine years. What am I kind of suffering from right now and then it will come back once the worm turns again. So I think we think about it that way, but would expect to get very, very strong margins when the cycle turns once again. Bob Shanks : And then when you think about your question around Asia Pacific outside of china, as you can see we've made progress and it's really in a couple of different areas. One is in the ASEAN markets we made a lot of progress and part of that was the industry getting better, but also we saw a lot of good mix on the back of our Ranger and Arius. The fruits of the labor of our Australian transformation plan are really starting to take hold as well as some capacity actions that we took in India. So we'll continue to work on that. We've seen some good improvement this year and we're going to work very hard to continue that in 2016 Colin. Colin Langan : Okay. Great. And any color on the pricing environment around the world? There\u2019s been a lot of concern about Europe and China. How is it looking for you and how are you thinking about it the next year? Mark Fields : Well when you look at Europe, it\u2019s still a challenging pricing environment, probably more challenging in the non-Euro countries like U.K. and Sweden as those currencies have strengthened against the Euro. But we're still seeing challenging situation there. I think the good news is when you look at our performance on the back of our new products we actually had positive pricing performance. So I think it's showing that the investments that we're making for our products are paying off. And China a little bit of a different story, we saw negative pricing in the industry of about 6% last year. We actually saw it probably peak at about 8% in the fourth quarter. Part of that was the purchase tax reduction and as we go forward into this year, we think we\u2019ll see it in that 6% range and again we\u2019ll see how we go going forward. And here in North America I think on the truck side it's pretty healthy. Obviously we're seeing more competition on the car side particularly the sedan side and given the migration we're seeing from customers. Colin Langan : Just one last question, I get a lot of questions around financing market in the U.S. it seem like Ford Credit's results were actually quite solid and stable. I think what are you seeing in the market? Are you seeing issues with the supply in particular? Any challenges out there that you're seeing in terms of the lending market product? Marion Harris : Colin, this is Marion. No, we\u2019re really not. I know there is a lot of discussion about this, but with the exception of the trend in longer term financing we're not seeing any weakness in the consumer alone. In fact delinquencies which are a leading indicator were at an all time record low for us. Colin Langan : And I think our mix of higher risk is what always is 5%, 6% right? Marion Harris : That\u2019s right. And so our underwriting same has remained consistent and our portfolio continues to be very robust. Colin Langan : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Galves from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dan Galves : All right. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, just looking at the dealer stocks in the appendix pretty big increase sequentially like 11% globally and some of the markets are up year-over-year a lot more than in overall industry demand is. So I guess could you comment on the sequential increase in stocks? Is that normal for this time of year and then looking forward, can you give us any color on what you expecting in terms of year-over-year, full year production growth for Ford in 2016? Mark Fields : Dan this is Mark. When you look at the stocks again you have to put into relation where the market are going and in the U.S. for example when you look at in our day supply basis we're only up one day from 2014. So we think we\u2019re in pretty good shape there. Europe, we're probably about four days above last year, but that\u2019s taking into account the growth that we're seeing as we went from quarter-to-quarter and we\u2019re actually seeing in January the growth in Europe continuing. So we think we\u2019re in good shape there and in China as we mentioned earlier we do have the seasonal increases in stocks as we get ready for the Chinese New Year. Bob Shanks : And in terms of what we are expecting for 2016 Dan, we do expect to see growth in volume in 2016, it's going to different by region. So we will have higher production, but we\u2019re not going to provide any specific details at this time. Dan Galves : Okay. Got it and then on the North American margins obviously really solid right now. Are you stick into the 8% to 10% kind of long term number even thought the pension accounting change added a 100 basis points. Just wanted to ask that question and then how should we think about the margin level let\u2019s say if -- have become more of a North America trend demand level or U.S. trend demand level in the $15 million range. How should we think about detrimental margin if eventually we do get a bit of a down tick in the U.S.? Mark Fields : Yeah, that's a good question. When we develop the 8% to 10% this was before, this was quite a number of years ago actually. So since then we've had this big reduction in interest rate which really drove very big increases in these re-measurement losses which is one of the reasons why after we saw that\u2019s a current understood how the market was really quite sophisticated in understanding the company\u2019s results when they treated in the way that we\u2019re now treating it. And so we decided to move in that direction so that you could clearly see the operating performance of the business. So we developed 8% to 10% before that. So I would say we're back to where we were in terms of the effective it had on the business. And we developed the 8% to 10% and think of it as over a longer business cycle. It's not peaked. We\u2019d actually like to maybe a bit below that and the downturn, but we\u2019d like on average to be around that 8% to 10% and so we see that as something that we're aspiring to get to we think with the breakeven that we have with North America that\u2019s probably where we would be. But going forward, as we've said, we\u2019re operating at this 10% level in fact in two of the last four years, I think we were over 11% from that. So we clearly can go higher and we'll continue to work to do that and certainly Joe is working to stay at the level that we've been in the last several years and do even better if possible, but we\u2019re operating at benchmark levels and the results speak for themselves. Dan Galves : Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Operator : Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Pat Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Pat Archambault : Thank you very much. Just a couple of follow ups, I guess for the North America profit walk for the fourth quarter on Slide 13, just wanted to understand how we see those cost playing out over the course of 2016. We appreciate the detail here. I think it\u2019s very helpful, but there seems to be some moving parts that will affect distinct parts of the year right. We have the anniversarying of the launch or the ramp of the F-150, the launch of the Super Duty and then presumably there is also opportunities that you have to take cost out of the existing F-150. So, how do those things interplay as we think about the cost performance versus '16? Mark Fields : Yeah, I think what you will see in 2016 as that you'll see as I mentioned earlier you'll see less tailwinds of those tailwinds from the market factors in terms of the cost you will see less of an impact on the contribution cost and particularly the product cost because we had the big effect in 2015 versus '14 because of the F-150, but also have the Edge and Mustang and some other products. In 2016 you won\u2019t see such a big effect. So I see much less of an increase in contribution cost in North America than we saw in 2015. And then in terms of the structural cost, we'll have an increase. A lot of that will be in manufacturing, it will be in engineering and some of the other aspects of the business including frankly some of the initiatives that we're working in smart mobility. But I think overall you'll see much less of a cost increase in North America in '16 than we had in '15 but it will be largely driven by the performance and contribution cost. Mark Fields : The only thing I would add Pat is as we look at the cost particularly Bob mentioned the contribution cost, we\u2019re also going to get the full year benefit of the price tower that we're seeing from these new products whether it\u2019s the Edge of the Lincoln MKX or the F-150 particularly in the second half of last year, we get the full benefit of that. Pat Archambault : Got it. Makes sense, one just addition to there on commodities, I think if I\u2019m paraphrasing you guys correctly at the Trade Auto Show that was fairly small positive and likely offset by FX I think it was maybe the commentary, even since then commodities have continued to go down, is there may be a potential upside risk there just given where some of these things are cracking. Mark Fields : Yeah, we saw -- I am not looking at the number, but I think was $930 million of good news on commodities for the company and a lot of that in North America and '15 and then we had the $249 million of exchange. Things are moving in fact since we talked at Deutsche Bank, things that moved, if we look at this year and I just got with the team yesterday and we've looked at this, I think we'll still see positive performance from commodities. It won\u2019t be quite as great based on what we\u2019re looking at right now as it was in 2015, but it will be positive and we will have some headwinds on the exchange. So I think the net of the two at the moment again it changes every day as you highlight it, but the net of the two won\u2019t be quite as strong as it was in '15. The other thing I would just highlight so everyone understands is that we basically of all you locked in about a third of our commodity's exposure either through contracts largely on steel and/or hedging that we do on some of the base metals including aluminum, which is the second largest exposure that we have. The other thing is that our policy on hedging for exchange is basically to have the operating exposure that we have identified across the full year largely hedged on key currencies, not every currency because we leave some un-hedged because we believe that they naturally are hedged with some of the commodities. But we lock in some of those commodities 100% operating basis at the beginning of the year and that\u2019s the position that we're in right now. So we do that not to play the market but we are trying to reduce the volatility both in terms of the impact of commodities and the impact of exchange -- operating exchange. Pat Archambault : Okay. Great. Thanks, appreciate the color. Operator : Okay. Thank you. So your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please go ahead. Brian Johnson : Yes, good morning. Most really probably for Mark is it I\u2019m believe Joe on the phone, if we think about overall environment in North America just around energy prices, it's almost like the opposite of 2007, 2008 we\u2019ve got gas prices approaching $1 in some places. apparently your pickup truck sales and light truck sales overall are very strong but within your results, can you give us a sense of what the drag is on cars maybe recap some of the capacity actions taken. And then with regard to the light trucks since this low gas price hasn\u2019t been lost on others, we heard from a competitor in your suburbs yesterday about adding SUV and pickup trucks capacity, some of the Asians seem to be converting cars to CUV capacity and how do you see the capacity situation in the industry for light trucks verses cars going forward? Mark Fields : Well Brian for your first question if you can tell me where that gas station is that\u2019s selling gas for a dollar. I'm there because that\u2019s a good price, but we're seeing gas prices here in the Detroit Area about $1.50. As you think about the second part of your question on SUV capacity, we think given our view of where the market is going that I think we're well positioned to capitalize on both SUV and trucks and we have opportunities to -- in terms of capacity we're nearly there, but we have opportunities to add line speeds, work during some of the shut down periods etcetera. So I think we're well positioned there. And in terms of the car capacity as you know we did take some down time in for example our Michigan assembly plant to make sure our stocks in line for vehicles like our Focus, but overall we'll just continue to work our process and you know our process, its always matching production to demand and we'll adjust as necessary. And just two more things on the truck piece of it and we're getting a little bit more specific. You may have seen the other day, we announced in Ohio assembly facility we're actually adding super duty capacity and also at our Louisville assembly plant where we make the Escape, we are actually putting in some increased line speed. So we will watch the market and be balanced in our inventories and focusing on profitable growth. Bob Shanks : And to jump in on that, those are the types of cost that show up in that volume related aspect of manufacturing social cost. So obviously they come in but we think they can also come off in a down turn. Brian Johnson : And in terms of the mix versus -- or the pricing versus contribution cost variance in cars, are you seeing pressure in pricing in cars? And so is there a tale of two cities within the profit walks that you're not -- that obviously wouldn't show it, but just directionally? Mark Fields : Well in the marketplace it's very clear what you\u2019re seeing is a percentage of variable marketing as a percent of the transaction or the MSRT, it is clearly higher on the car side and I think that's reflective of the segmentation shifts that we're seeing. And there's a number of our competitors that really want to defend that. We want to make sure as usual, we're taking a balanced approach to profitable growth and as we said, we will just work our process of matching production to demand. Brian Johnson : Okay. Then just finally on that, why not over the midterm have more plants that can flex back and forth like the one here in Chicago? Between cars and light trucks. Mark Fields : Well as you know if you looked actually over the last seven or eight years as you look across our plants, we have increased the flexibility and I think you can assume that going forward we're going to continue to walk down that path because we've always said, we want to make sure we position ourselves for market changes. So I think you can be assured we're going to continue down that path. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Okay. Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC. Please go ahead. Joseph Spak : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just going back to some of the announcements and comments around Detroit and then, Mark, again you talked about this transformation into more of a mobility company. It's clear that partners are going to become important. I think you have already seen that with some of your announcements. I realize it varies depending on what you are trying to do, but can you give us some sense as to how you go about that process? Especially since you could build the case that in some areas, depending on the partner or the function, that could theoretically distract the consumer from the Ford brand and potentially even marginalize the brand. Mark Fields : Well to answer your question Joe when you look at where we're heading we said we were transforming into an auto and a mobility company because it\u2019s really important that we don\u2019t lose sight of our core business as I mentioned on our remarks upfront. But when we look at partners and first off in some cases, I\u2019ll use an example of the Amazon relationship that we have. That really came out of an idea from one of our folks in our Pala Alto facility and it happened to also bump into one of the Amazon folks in the valley. So part of it is just discovery that happens. The other piece is as we identify a need in the marketplace, we look within ourselves and we say what are our core competencies and in some cases we convince ourselves. We can fulfill that need on our own. In other cases we can say listen there are other great companies out there that we can approach and partner with. So that\u2019s kind of the process that we're going through to identify these opportunities and then to execute them. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thanks for the color guys. Operator : Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : Good morning, everybody. Just a couple things. First, you've been asked this in some ways, strategy in passenger cars. Obviously, some competitors are acknowledging that in some markets like North America passenger cars are going to be tough for as far as the eye can see, assuming oil stays where it is. And you see what GM is doing with capacity and yesterday FCA saying they are going to outsource the Dart and the Chrysler 200. Haven't heard anything along those lines from Ford. Is the bottom line that you just have to accept lower margins in certain segments in order to have a balanced approach, or is there a plan to address the passenger car situation more broadly? Mark Fields : Well as you know Rod we're always looking to be as efficient as possible and to your point, in every product that we bring out we want to make sure we're earning our appropriate return on that. As you think about small cars and just cars in general, we believe very strongly that it\u2019s important to have a balanced portfolio because it\u2019s to anticipate changes in customer demand, changes in the economic environment or the regulatory environment. So as we go forward, we're going to be very focused on this and understanding in some cases what do we do on our own. We're always open to talking with others and as we go forward because we realize that we have to be very realistic around what is the type of revenue that these vehicles will be able to command and make sure we have an appropriate cost structure to earn a reasonable return. Rod Lache : So I guess that's TBD on the plans there. I appreciate the color you provided on the structural cost inflation and where that's coming from. Could you just give us a sense of maybe bracketing how we should be thinking about structural cost inflation in North America as we look out to 2016 in the base case? And in a slowdown, how much latitude do you have to moderate that part of your cost structure? Bob Shanks : Well in terms of 2016 over '15, I think you'll probably see less effect of these volume related costs because of what we've seen -- what we've done last year coming off of '14 where we had a lot of down weeks and that sort of thing and also just we had a really big increase in overall volume year over year. I don\u2019t see that happening to the same degree in 2016. We'll still have some volume related cost and Mark just referred to a couple of them, but I don\u2019t think that will be as much of a factor in '16 versus '15. But the key point which is what you mentioned Rod and I think someone else just touched on, but the key point is that we just want to highlight that our structural costs aren\u2019t necessarily fixed cost, that we've got the ability when volume changes or the economic cycle changes to go in and do something about it. I think you can see an example of that in South America, where despite really big headwinds on inflation we're actually getting net reductions through actions of the team we're taking including around some of these volume related factors, but we're probably across the business and that flexibility is there. I think the way that perhaps we were showing and talking about the structural cost that wasn\u2019t clear and so we just wanted to make that understandable to the investors. Rod Lache : Okay, thanks. Then just two more last things. One is any color on how you are feeling about credit costs? Obviously, benchmarks and spreads have widened a little bit in certain markets, subprime, ABS. Even the Ford Credit CDS has widened slightly. If that continues, is there something -- is that something the industry absorbs or do you think that gets passed along? And then just a point of clarification on your Asia earnings guidance for 2016 in the context of I think you said minus 5% pricing. How are you feeling about Asia this year? Bob Shanks : Well let me answer the Asia question, I may have Marian respond to your other question about the credit spreads. So we've factored that in and I think Mark actually mentioned that we were assuming about 5% or 6% reduction in pricing in China. So we have factored that in and we actually came in line at about that level I think on 2015. So that is consistent with our guidance of higher results in '16 versus '15. Marion? Marion Harris : Okay, Rod and you\u2019re absolutely right credit spreads have been widening out a bit and that has affected us and the industry. But on the other side of that the base rates have not gone up as much as we had anticipated either and so the actual all-in cost to the consumer hasn\u2019t really flown through yet. Rod Lache : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Stover from Susquehanna Investment Group. Please go ahead. Matt Stover : Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered and I don't want to beat a dead horse, but I kind of want to think about this car problem or car issue because it feels like it's deja vu all over again with the industry. I know you guys are in a much different place versus FCA in terms of your product and your balance sheet. But I do wonder if you think about this program over the course of the next five years, if there -- or 10 years rather, if there's an opportunity for you to more significantly restructure the cost structure of your small and mid cars. And what I'm specifically speaking about are the transmissions and engines, referring back to some of the work that you've done with GM on transmissions in the pickup truck market. Are there opportunities for you to husband some capital investment as you think about these new programs to fundamentally improve the cost structure of them as their near term demand seems uncertain, but long term demand seems more necessary. Mark Fields : Yeah, thanks for the question Matt. And you're right. It's a little bit like looking at the crystal ball and your view depends upon the point that you're at and right now obviously we\u2019re seeing customers migrate more towards small and medium size SUVs. But in simple answer to your question, yes, we're looking at all opportunities because we want to make sure that we get a good return on our invested capital as you saw we\u2019re measuring that and we pay a lot of attention to that as a company. So we\u2019re going to always look at different opportunities to improve the profitability of all of our vehicles including our small cars. Matt Stover : Just out of curiosity from a timing standpoint, has the Board okayed the next-generation Fusion and Focus or is that still something in front of the Board? Mark Fields : No, we don\u2019t talk about what decisions have been made by the Board etcetera, but obviously you're seeing the launch of the freshened Fusion that we showed at the North American International Auto Show. Matt Stover : Okay. Thanks Mark. Mark Fields : Sure. Operator : Okay. Thank you. So our next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : Great, thanks for taking my question. Maybe a couple really on the latest that you are seeing in terms of demand in China and the U.S. The stock market seems -- the industry market seems actually quite great in both of those countries, but the stock market seemed to sort of reflect the price to the automakers and the suppliers that investors think that these markets could decelerate maybe materially over the short run. So just what you are seeing there, the latest, for example, in China the big surge in 4Q; does that pull ahead from future periods? And if so, which future periods? Because industry forecasters, like IHS, they are increasing their outlook for 2016 thinking it pulls from 2017, but the investors we talked to think it pulls from much sooner, like as soon as this quarter. So any color you can provide on what you are seeing in China in January, etcetera that would be helpful. Then in the U.S., too, December was a little bit softer than the preceding months. Are there any signs that the U.S. is really slowing on an underlying basis? Are there any real reasons to think it might slow as the stock prices, including your stock price, seems to maybe imply? Mark Fields : Okay, Ryan thanks for the question. In China obviously as we mentioned, when you look at the stock market volatility, that\u2019s endemic of the country that's moving from an investment and industry led economy to one that's consumer led. And actually when you look at the components of GDP growth there, the services in the consumer portions of that are actually growing while some of the industry ones are coming down and we view that as a good sign. It's going to be a big bumpy as they go through that transition. As we mentioned in the fourth quarter you usually see a more production by the industry and by us that\u2019s normal as we get for the -- get ready for the Chinese New Year. We're going in we're in line with our stocks going into January, into China. And as I mentioned China started off -- the month is starting off strong. We have seen it moderate in the second half verses the first half, but as I mentioned, we really have to wait and see how January and February play out because of where the Chinese New Year falls this year and we will get a good sense for that. But our view is that the market will grow in China this year and a lot of that on the back of the response we've seen from the purchase tax reduction. In the case of North America in terms of the industry, we don\u2019t see the cycle being over. Obviously the consumer sector drives the majority of the economic growth. All the metrics we're seeing, wages growing, jobs growing, low interest rates, low energy costs, those types of things are really putting more spending power in the hands of consumers and when you marry that with the demographics of the inventory of vehicles that are out there, they\u2019re the oldest they\u2019ve ever been, pickup trucks also in particular are very old. So we think that bodes well. As we get into January what we're seeing it will probably be a solid month for the industry, but as you know January is always a bit of a difficult month to call, right because it\u2019s a small industry. There\u2019s lots of seasonality. Of course I hate the turn January always into a weather report, but there\u2019s always storms and obviously we have that big one on the East Coast. So we could see an industry maybe around 17 million units, maybe somewhere around there, but I think it\u2019s a little bit of a tricky month, but what we're seeing in our business, commercial sales continue to be strong and we will report out on February 2. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. That's helpful and encouraging color. Thanks a lot. Mark Fields : Sure. Operator : Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Mark Fields : Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner : So I appreciate all the color on the profile from North American margins and certainly understand the issue of maybe less industry growth this year and then the Super Duty launch. It also feels like there's a decent amount of it that has to do with investments, maybe not necessarily just for the short term but for the longer term of the business. Can you give a little more color on that? It just feels, maybe in comparison with some of your competitors, that you seem to be investing more heavily maybe. Can you either put that into buckets or how should we think about these investments and what they are going towards? Mark Fields : Well I think let me start with, I think we said that at Deutsche Bank, but our CapEx for the company for this year is expected to be about $7.7 billion. I think we came in at $7.1 billion in 2015. So you can see that, that will be increasing again as we invest for our future growth. As I look across the business more broadly and I think you were talking specifically Emmanuel about North America, is that correct? Emmanuel Rosner : Yes. Mark Fields : There I think we will see higher engineering. The spending related will go up because we've been ahead of the curve in terms of the spending. The DNA is catching up. So that\u2019s probably going to be around $0.5 billion alone. And then there is additional investments that we're making to support some of our more future opportunities around Ford Smart Mobility, which we're not going to break out, but clearly that is something that is ahead of us as well. So around product refreshment, powertrain investments to support regulatory actions, and Ford Smart Mobility and obviously we expect all of them to pay off which they\u2019ve done over the little last six years. Emmanuel Rosner : Great. And then still on the topic of investments, just wanted to ask a little bit more about where you stand now in China. I know you've opened a lot of factories and capacity over the past few years, including in 2015. Is there more to do? Do you have more in the works or are you pretty much now working at filling this capacity and maximizing what you have? Mark Fields : Well from a capacity standpoint we're at 2.7 million units across Asia and when you look at China in particular we're at 1.9. We are adding our Harbin facility a little later this year. So I think we're in good shape Emmanuel from a capacity standpoint and when you look at the investments as Bob mentioned earlier, the investments on the product freshness in China, but also meeting the regulatory requirements of powertrain and those type of things and also Ford Smart Mobility. Emmanuel Rosner : Great. Thank you very much. Mark Fields : Welcome. Operator : Okay. Thank you/ [Operator Instruction] So our next question comes from the line of Christina Rogers from the Wall Street Journal. Christina Rogers : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Mark Fields : Hi Christian. Christina Rogers : First off on the UAW profit sharing, how much will that cost in absolute turns? Is this a matter of just taking the 93,000 per worker and multiplying it by the workforce? And when will that payout be booked? Is it in the first quarter? And my second question is also on the shift and demand to trucks. Auto Nation's Mike Jackson just said America has gone truck-crazy and it sound like there is opportunity there for you to increase production on those vehicles, but I\u2019m wondering will you be taking down passenger car capacity to do that? Mark Fields : Okay, Christina on your question on UAW profit, its generally in line, but again the profit sharing checks when we say on average is 93,000, so it depends on how many hours have been worked by the employee etcetera. And that profit sharing check will be paid in the first quarter and its booked in the first quarter as well. When you think about trucks obviously we have our capacity, it\u2019s a medium term thing, but in general when you look at trucks just focus on F Series for a minute, we\u2019re going to have -- we expect actually our volume on F-150, we think there is upside opportunity this year to grow it versus 2015 because we now have the availability of regular cabs and super cabs and so we didn\u2019t have a lot of availability of that and so that will give us some good entry points both from the mid and the entry level price points. So we think we have about opportunity to grow at least our volume in F-150, but over the longer term, again we'll make our assumptions around what we think the segmentation is going and make appropriate capacity changes. No and just in the short terms as we talked about earlier, line shift beat or lines beat adjustments and working shutdowns. Marion Harris : And just to clarify, we pay it in the first quarter -- about 1,500 of that was paid in the fourth quarter that was -- and we accrue could -- we accrue that throughout 2015. We accrue in advance. Christina Rogers : With the total charge look like in the first quarter for the payout to have\u2026 Mark Fields : Well, it\u2019s a cash outflow, it\u2019s not a profit hit because we accrued for it during 2015. So that profit recognition is behind us. It\u2019s in the results that you're seeing today. Christina Rogers : Okay. Okay. And then regarding the passenger car capacity, will you be looking to take that down as you increase volume on the truck and SUV side? Mark Fields : That will be based on our view of segmentation going forward. So that will be part of our business planning process. Christina Rogers : Thank you. Operator : Okay. Thank you. So your next question comes from the line of Bob Gritzinger from WardsAuto. Please go ahead. Bob Gritzinger : Hi, thanks for taking my call. I noted that you\u2019re dropping out of the Japanese and Indonesian markets in the coming year are there other small volume market that you are considering pulling out of. Mark Fields : Well, obviously we announced Japan and Indonesia. We\u2019re going to follow our normal process and we\u2019re committed to serving global markets, but also at the same time, we\u2019re committed to aggressively restructuring parts of our business where we don\u2019t see a reasonable path to sustain profitability or a return on our investment over a reasonable period of time. So we\u2019ll continue to work that process going forward, but nothing to announce. Bob Gritzinger : Okay. Good. Thanks for taking my call. Mark Fields : You bet. Operator : Okay. Thank you. We have no more questions at this time. So now I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ted Cannis. Please go ahead. Ted Cannis : All right. Thank you very much everybody for joining the call today and we\u2019ll see you soon. Operator : Thank you for participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect and have a good day.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ted Cannis, Executive Director, Ford Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ted Cannis - Executive Director- Investor Relations : All right. Thanks very much, Tiffany. Good morning and welcome, everybody, for the first quarter 2016 financial results. As normal, copies of the press release and the presentation slides are available on Ford's Investor website and the media websites. As always, the results discussed today include some non-GAAP references and those are reconciled to the US GAAP equivalent in the appendix to the slides. Also, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance. Actual results may vary, and those most significant factors are included in our presentation. Also, by the way, later today we will be issuing the 10-Q and Ford Credit will be hosting a call at 11 :00 AM to review their results. Now presenting today and we'll have a few more comments, Mark Fields, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are Stuart Rowley, Vice President and Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President and Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Corporate Accounting; and Marion Harris, our Ford Credit CFO. Before we dive in, we just made some changes to the presentation just to make it a little clearer for you, a bit of a more overall look to the business and highlight key points. And also, we just wanted to show you how we're continuing to focus on creating value and driving our long-term growth. So with that, Mark, ready to go. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: All right. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. We have some very strong results to share with you today. In fact, an all-time record quarter for the company and very strong performance across the business. Our company pre-tax profit came in at $3.8 billion and that was $2.1 billion better than a year ago. Our net income was $2.5 billion and our operating earnings per share was $0.68. Both those results are more than double versus last year. Our revenue was $37.7 billion and that was up $3.8 billion, increasing 15% from last year at constant exchange and 11% as reported. We grew global market share from 6.9% to 7.1% and that was driven by improvements in North America, Europe, and our Asia Pacific regions. Our Automotive operating margin came in at 9.8% and that was a quarterly record, and Automotive operating-related cash flow was $2.7 billion and that was a record for the first quarter. We also provided $1.7 billion of distributions to our shareholders in the quarter as well. We had a tremendous performance across our portfolio of businesses. Here in North America, we achieved a record quarterly profit and a record operating margin of 12.9%. Looking at Europe, we earned $434 million in the quarter and that was up $476 million from a year ago. And this was also our fourth consecutive profitable quarter in Europe. Our revenue in Asia Pacific climbed 18% to $2.7 billion, and pre-tax profit more than doubled. And Ford Credit grew pre-tax profit and they delivered more than $500 million in the quarter. So all-in-all, a very strong start to the year, and given our strong start, we remain confident in our expectations to deliver another strong year in 2016. And we're taking the opportunity today to reaffirm the guidance for the company that we gave in January, which is to deliver performance equal to or better than last year's record. So now let's turn to slide four. And we are continuously focused on the four drivers of shareholder value that you can see on the screen here. That's about growth, returns, risk, and rewards. So first, let's talk about growth. Growth is strong and it's especially evident in our trucks, our SUVs, and as we pursue expansion into mobility. Second, let's focus on returns. We expect strong returns from our healthy mix, targeted increases in investments that will make the business stronger in the years ahead, and diversifying regional profitability. And this includes continuing our momentum in Europe and Asia, acting decisively in South America, reducing high-cost car capacity, of course increasing efficiencies across the business, and leveraging partnerships where we can. Third, let's turn to risk. Our risk profile is improving as we work to reduce our break-even levels globally with a focus on sustaining our robust structure in North America, strengthening our regional diversity, and maintaining one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. And finally, let's talk about rewards. We're continuing to reward our shareholders with the payout of our regular dividend, plus a supplemental dividend, and we will remain absolutely focused on driving total shareholder returns and ensuring we maintain our regular dividend through a downturn. So looking at the first quarter on slide five, as I mentioned earlier, we made a lot of progress in all four focus areas. We grew our top line and announced our actions to continue to grow our core business, while expanding our business model into new areas of emerging opportunities around mobility. Our returns were strong, setting a number of records, as I mentioned earlier, and demonstrating very strong broad-based performance. In terms of risk, our business units outside of North America collectively were profitable and improved year-over-year. We also, at the same time, saw the progress we've made in improving our risk profile, which was recognized by ratings upgrades in the quarter by Moody's, S&P, and DBRS. And finally, in terms of rewards, we increased distributions with the addition of a supplemental dividend of $1 billion. Looking at slide six, among some of the other quarters, other highlights, we were recognized for the strength of our products, notably the F-150, as well as for our ethics as the only automaker on the list of the World's Most Ethical Companies. We continue progress in our journey to grow the Lincoln brand, and of course advances in new technologies and new mobility projects. So with that, now let's turn to our view of the global business environment and what's ahead. So looking at the global business environment on slide seven, conditions remain broadly supportive of growth in the global economy. This will be driven by the U.S.; continued modest recovery in the euro area; growth in the U.K., despite probably some increased volatility that we are seeing ahead of the June Brexit referendum; and continued growth in China, although at slower pace that we've seen in recent years. We also expect conditions in Brazil and Russia to remain difficult through 2016. And before I turn it over to Bob, who will take us through some of the details of our performance, let me just underscore again the strength and the broad-based nature of the record quarter that our team delivered, the very strong start to the year and our expectations to deliver another strong year in 2016. So with that, Bob, do you want to take it away? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I sure will. So let's start the financial review here on slide nine by looking at the key financial metrics, both for the company and also the automotive and the financial services sector. Now, because I'm going to cover many of these metrics on subsequent slides, I just want to pull out a few things from this one. First, if I ask you to look at the year-over-year performance in the column to the right, just scan down that column and you can see everything is essentially positive and very, very positive versus a year ago. The one exception is special items. We did not have any special items a year ago. We have two that we are booking in this quarter. The larger of the two was at $186 million; relates to buyouts that were part of the UAW contract that we agreed in the fourth quarter. The remainder of the special items relate to charges associated with our exits from the Japanese and the Indonesian markets. If you go just above that you can see our operating EPS of $0.68. $0.39 better than where we were a year ago, so more than doubling that. And if you go down two lines to after-tax results or net income at $2.5 billion, again we more than doubled that particular metric. What's not shown on the slide is our tax rate that came in at 29.5%, which was lower than what it was a year ago. So with that, let's turn to the next slide and here we'll look at the company results. These are absolutes and we'll look at it by segment. To the far left, you can see the record profit of $3.8 billion. Going right beside that, we've got the North American result, $3.1 billion. Go to the far right, financial services came in very strong at about $0.5 billion, and within that Ford Credit was $514 million. We had the best result in Europe since 2008 at $434 million. We doubled our profit in Asia Pacific at $220 million, and then in South America we had a loss, as expected, and in the Middle East & Africa we fell into a loss driven by largely the external environment exchange. I will talk about that in a bit. And in Other Automotive, that's largely net interest expense. Now when you look at the operations outside of North America, the business units outside North America, we did make a profit there. It was nearly $400 million and that was more than $400 million better than a year ago. All right, let's go to the next slide and we will start going through the details of the automotive sectors starting with the sector itself. These are the key metrics and as you just scan across, you can see all of them very, very strong and all of them improved compared with 2015 first quarter. Starting at the left, we had strong growth in the top line, both wholesales and revenue up double digits. Revenue at constant exchange was actually up 15%. We grew our market share and that was in a global SAAR that also grew up 3%. And that was around North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe. Operating margin was a record at 9.8% up sharply, and then Automotive also set a record at $3.3 billion, again up sharply from where we were a year ago. All right. Let's go to the next slide and we'll look at what was behind the improvement. This is slide 12. A $2 billion improvement and, as you can see, it was driven largely by higher volume, favorable mix, and favorable cost performance, driven by favorable contribution cost. We did have negative net pricing, but within that $548 million decline there was a one-time stock accrual effect that I will talk about in just a minute. That was over $600 million. You will note in the callout box for volume and mix, mix and other we had over $1 billion of good news on product mix. And that was a theme that really drove performance, not only in North America, but also in Europe and in Asia Pacific. All right. Let's go to the next slide. Now we'll start going through the business units with North America. North America, of course, had extraordinary performance and it was very, very strong right across the board, very strong improvement in the top line at over 20%. Revenue about the same, market share was up in a growing industry, both for the region and in the U.S., and that was driven by two things. One, it was in North America, rather in U.S. and that was fleet sales. It was around SUVs, Transit, and F-Series, but also in Canada. We had very strong performance in Canada. We were up 1.5 points of share. That was driven by F-150 and by the Edge. Operating margin at 12.9%, a record, and then the $3.1 billion that we talked about earlier. So really, really strong performance in North America. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: And just some \u2013 we've gotten some questions around fleet sales, and Bob mentioned fleet. There's just absolutely no change to our approach in fleet. Fleet is good business for us, including rental, commercial and government sales. We understand these customers real well; their use cases. Rental deliveries, as we've said before, were frontloaded this year. This is primarily due to the model year changeover, which in some of our vehicles was late last year, and based on rental company requests because, keep in mind, rental companies like to purchase their vehicles as close as possible to job one as possible. And for the full year, we expect our rental sales to be about the same as last year with the government and commercial sales up slightly, driven by the availability of the new F-150, because a lot of variants have now come on board. So we have good margins in the fleet business and, as you can see, they contributed nicely to a record performance in the quarter in North America. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Let's go to the next slide, and we'll look at what drove the improvement in North America's results of $1.5 billion. As you can see here, it was higher volume, it was favorable mix, and it was lower cost performance. So it was very strong in some really key parts of the business. Within \u2013 there's three or four things that I want to call out here. If you look at the stock performance of $691 million in the callout box there for volume and mix, that is more than explained by the F-Series. This time last year, we were launching F-Series, F-150 rather, in Kansas City. Obviously, that's behind us now, and we're operating both Dearborn and Kansas City at three crews. So that's simply reversing what was an anomaly last year and making it more normal. So on a year-over-year basis, picked up that good news. If you go into mix, mix and other, about $0.5 billion, and that was actually favorable product mix. Again that was around returning to normal with F-150, but also a year ago we were launching the Oakville products, the Edge as well as the MKX. We are benefiting from the fact that that plant is now up and running. We've got normal supply of those successful products. If you go into the net pricing, this one is interesting. You can see the incentives and other of negative $1.2 billion. Half of that is a one-time stock accrual that is taking place and most of that, about 80% of it. Again it's driven by the anomaly of last year. Last year, because we were launching the F-150 at Kansas City, we had extremely low levels of inventory. We also had very low levels of incentives. So in the first quarter this year, of course we had normal supply. The incentives, while they are still lower than our domestic competitors, they're at what we would consider to be normal levels, and so that effect is reflected in the stock adjustment. So if you think about it, that's an accounting adjustment. It didn't have any effect in the quarter in terms of what incentives were given to customers. And so, if you take that out, we actually had somewhat positive, small, but positive net pricing. And then with the favorable mix that I talked about, we ended up having higher U.S. retail transaction prices. They were up about $1,500, if you exclude lease. Okay, let's go to the next slide. We will look at South America. South America, the team is doing a great job in a very, very difficult environment. And this is really around Brazil, because we actually are very encouraged by what we're seeing in Argentina from the actions of the government, the new government has taken since it has come into power. Very, very positive and really bodes well for what we can see from that part of the region in the months and years ahead. But if you look at the metrics, we did have a sharp decline in wholesale, down 38%. Revenue was down 44%. Half of that actually was exchange. If you look at market share, we had a decline. As we pulled back from certain sales, it just didn't make any sense in terms of profitability, so we lost share, if you will, in an industry that was down. The results of that is we had a sharp decline in the operating margin, and we were able to keep the increased loss, if you will, to about $67 million. And we'll go through that on the next slide, please, slide 16. So this was really around industry volume. You can see that we had a negative industry volume, effective $91 million. That was Brazil itself down 29%. The team continued to do a great job on cost performance. Last year, we did over $400 million in terms of the cost performance. We did $76 million in the quarter and during the quarter, and there's not much effect from this, but during the quarter we did remove the third crew at Camacari, which is something I mentioned to the analysts and investors that were listening in on the Let's Chat call back in March. So, team's still working to get more costs out because the environment is still very, very difficult. We still expect probably next year that we will start to see things bottom out, particularly from the commodity cycle, and start to turn around. Let's go to the next slide. That will turn to Europe, which is a great, great story. Europe, if you look at the metrics, wholesale volume up, while revenue as reported was flat. Actually up 6% at constant exchange. We had higher share in an industry that was growing. That share was driven in terms of markets by Italy, Germany, and Russia. In terms of product, it was basically SUVs and commercial vehicles. The operating margin was over 6%. And again that profit, that was the best that we've had since 2008. So very, very strong performance in Europe. Let's go to the next slide and see how we got there. The improvement of nearly $0.5 billion came from everything. Industry was favorable. The volume factors were favorable. The mix was favorable to the tune, within that $106 million that's shown on the slide, of about $300 million that was both product mix from what we've done around the products over the last number of years, as well as series mix and options. And then we had favorable cost performance, both contribution costs and structural costs. And even though it's not shown on the slide, even though the Russian market continues to be very challenging, actually Russia improved on a year-over-year basis as well. So the team, really delivering across all aspects of the business in Europe and you can see the results of that. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Just a little bit more color on Europe. If you recall, a central part of our European transformation plan that we last launched at the end of 2012 was continuing to invest in our core business of great product. And as you can see from the results here, it's really starting to pay off. Actually our average transaction prices in Europe on a year-over-year basis were up over $1,200 and actually our high series models and sports derivatives accounted for 60% of our Ford passenger vehicle sales. Things like Titanium, Vignale, ST versions of Focus and Fiesta, and even Mustang, which, I don't know if you caught this, but in March Mustang was the best-selling sports car in Germany, leading folks like Porsche 911. So this is really allowing us to accelerate our efforts in total. And many of the things that we saw in the North American turnaround we used as a blueprint for Europe and it's paying off. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Great, let's go on to the next region, Middle East & Africa. This is a region also that has many, many challenges external deal, geopolitical issues, weak currencies, a number of the markets are major oil producers and so they are suffering, if you will, in terms of the low oil prices. But within that environment the team basically held on wholesales. Revenue was actually flat, excluding exchange. As reported, it was down 9%. We held our own in terms of share and that was in a declining industry. It was down about 7%, 8%. But if you take Iran out, which actually is growing, and we don't participate in Iran, it was down over 20%. In that environment, we did move into a small loss of $14 million and that was largely driven by weakness of the South African Rand. We've got operations in South Africa and adversely impacted by the weakness of that currency. All right, let's go to the next slide and turn to the great story here in Asia Pacific. We had another strong quarter driven by new products. You can see wholesale is up 9%, revenue up 18%, 25% at constant exchange. Here we also grew share in a region that also was growing. The AP SAAR was up over 2 million units, as was China, so strong performance there, it was really driven by the new products that we have introduced. And China was one of the big factors there as well in terms of market contribution to the share. But we saw share improvement in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, ASEAN, Australia so a lot of good things going on in terms of the market performance across the region. Our operating margin was over 8% and the pre-tax results at $220 million. On the lower right of the slide, slide 20 I'm on \u2013 I don't think I mentioned that \u2013 you can see the very strong performance we had from our China JVs that came in at $443 million. That was up sharply, over 20%, and they generated a margin of 16.4%. The other good thing about the performance in the region is that we had good news coming from China, but we also had good news coming from the other parts of the region : India, ASEAN, and Australia. So that was very encouraging. Let's go to the next slide, and this is how we got here. It was largely around volume, so industry share and then the favorable mix that I had mentioned earlier. This was again driven by the new products. Edge was one of the big factors, but we saw good news from the Ranger, we saw good news from Mondeo, and a number of other products. So again, a broad-based contribution there. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: I just came back from the Beijing Auto Show, and it was very interesting to see consumers are almost fervor for SUVs. You saw it not only in the exhibitors that were there, but just looking at the folks that were crowded around the vehicles. And I think the investments that we've made over the last couple of years to have a full lineup of SUVs \u2013 small, medium, and large is really great for timing of the market. At the same time, we introduced the Raptor. And I have to tell you, I literally had to, as we were done presenting, it run out of the way because of the people running up to the vehicle. I think that vehicle will do well, not only just from a sales standpoint, and it won't play a major role, but we will sell, I think, every one we can but what we'll do to continue to accelerate the perception of our brand. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Let's move on to another part of the business we absolutely love, that's Ford Credit. I should mention that today at 11 o'clock, and the details are in the press release, we are going to have a Ford Credit earnings call for the first time. And that will be led by Bernard Silverstone and Marion Harris. You will be able at get much more deeply into that part of the business. But we have that on some extra slides and data here are to support this call, so let's go through it. On slide 22, you can see contract volume was flat. We grew everywhere with the exception of the U.S., and that was largely driven by the type of marketing programs that we had in effect in the U.S. in the first quarter. Managed receivables were up. Pre-tax results over $0.5 billion, as I mentioned, and up. If we look at some of the metrics around U.S. retail and lease performance, we still had a very strong FICO score. If you look at the delinquencies, over 60 days they were only up 1 basis point; loss to receivables up 11 basis points. And those are levels that we still consider to be at the very low end of our historical performance, so very healthy. Let's go to the next slide and look at the improved results year-over-year of $31 million that was driven by a strong growth in all of our products and regions. We did have unfavorable performance in credit losses and also lease residuals. I kind of referred to the lease residual performance at Let's Chat in March and that was driven by a couple of factors. One, we had losses on units that came in during the quarter and we also have an expectation of lower auction values going forward. So we've had an impact in terms of accumulated supplemental depreciation and that is very much in line with what I said at Let's Chat about that metric coming in : bad news year-over-year, but less than $100 million. If you look at the credit loss, that was also impacted. There were two things there. Charge-offs increased related to severities, and then we also have increases to the reserves. Expectations, again, of the impact of lower auction values going forward, but also just the business being bigger. Let's go to the next slide. This is an added slide giving you some additional metrics around some areas that I know of interest from analysts and investors. On the upper left, if you look at the lease performance, the industry has been \u2013 we have been seeing increasing lease rates over the last number of years, but even during the last few quarters. And you can see in the first quarter, it was 32%. We have traditionally not been at the same level as the industry, which was the case. In the first quarter, we came in at 26%. Our expectations are that for the full year we will come in at a level that will be below that. Again, we are continuing to follow a proprietary modeling that we do of lease, making sure that we don't have any concentration of risk, whether it's geographical, product series, and so forth. We are very comfortable at the level of leasing, but that number will come down for the full year. On the bottom just beneath that, you can see our experience in terms of auction values at first quarter mix across all periods there. And you can see that we have seen a decline in both 24 months and 36 months auction values versus a year ago. We are up sequentially from the fourth quarter. We would normally have expected that increase to be higher. It hasn't occurred and that is largely based on supply. We have, across the industry, more units coming back from the increasing rates of lease over the last number of years. We'll have about 200,000 units coming back this year. Demand, for us anyway, is still very healthy and about where it has been, we just have more units coming back. So we have assumed going forward, as I mentioned earlier, lower auction values. And that's built into our guidance. If you go to the upper right, you can see the retail contract placement terms, our experienced. Of course, this has been, again, an industry trend of longer-term placement terms, for us at least, over the last number of quarters. We are sort of around that 64-month level. We do have \u2013 we are participating in terms that exceed that and you can see that on the line. About 3% to 4% of our business has been at 73 months or higher, which is well below what the industry is at. And if you go below that, you can see our FICO scores. You can see we did have a decline in the first quarter. That is not unusual. We've gone back and looked at the last five years, and we generally see that happen, a lot of that is mainly due to the types of marketing programs that we have in place in the quarter, which tends to drive a little bit fewer customers to Ford Credit than to other alternative financing. If you look at the line, you can see our risk portfolio continues to be in that 5% to 6% range that we've had for quite a number of years. So, very robust balance sheet and strong performance by Ford Credit. All right, let's go to the next slide and we will look at cash. This is slide 25. I think the best thing to say about the very strong performance on cash flow is it just underscores the quality of the earnings. You can see the $3.3 billion of automotive pre-tax profit. Over 80% of that flew right through the cash flow, so a very, very strong quality of earnings message there. With that cash flow, we had some pay down of debt, normal maturities. We did fund some of our funded pension plans. We're still on track to $1.5 billion for the year and then, of course, the dividends that Mark mentioned. In addition, in the quarter we completed the anti-dilutive share repurchase program that was about $145 million. Ended with very strong liquidity and automotive debt of about $13 billion. That is up a little bit from where we were at the end of last year. It was largely exchange and some non-cash debt changes. Okay, with that I'm going to turn it over to Mark. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Thanks, Bob. Slide 26 summarizes our industry and our GDP planning assumptions going forward. Again, all-in-all, we see conditions as being supportive of growth in the automotive industry sales globally and for the major markets that you see on the slide here. Our expectations for the full year industry sales by market are unchanged. I won't go through slides 27 and 28, but they show our guidance for each of the business units and our company guidance, both of which are unchanged. And just to provide some additional color on guidance, we are through the first quarter. We had a really good start to the year, and we'll continue to focus on delivering our guidance, which is equal to or better than last year's record. So just kind of bringing it all together on slide 29, the first quarter was an absolutely terrific start to the year for us. It was an all-time record quarter for the company. It was a very strong performance across our businesses. Our commitment remains to accelerate our pace of progress even further, and again focusing on those four key areas that drive creating value in the company : growth, returns, risks, and rewards. Importantly, we are building on our strengths as we expand our business model to be both an auto and a mobility company and also taking advantage of emerging opportunities through Ford Smart Mobility. Importantly, as we grow, we are committed to growing lean and focusing on profitability. So, I guess the bottom line is that we expect 2016 to be another strong year with sustained strong financial performance and returns and with continued strength into 2017. And I believe our results this quarter clearly demonstrate that our passion for products, our focus on innovation in all areas of our business, and driving improved mix \u2013 they are driving improved mix, a strong business structure, and of course exciting new technology that benefits our customers around the world, all of which is paying off with the record performance. So we're proud of our achievements, but with the full understanding that we have to continually earn them. We're excited about the future and we are confident in our ability to continue to drive growth, returns and rewards at lower risk across the entire company. So with that, why don't we open it up to your questions? Operator : Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Pat Archambault of Goldman Sachs. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. Good morning and congrats on a great result. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Thanks, Pat. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I guess maybe two areas of questions for me, it is first on the walk in North America. Just a little bit more, perhaps, on the pricing versus cost piece. Maybe I'll just take it at a very, very high level. I think one would've expected that, given the newness of the portfolio, pricing would be still up as it was in previous quarters. And I get that there was that inventory adjustment, but even with that it seems that pricing would have been up much? Then also, likewise, on the positive side, I guess -- I think I was quite surprised by the extent of benefits from lower variable costs, right, and just given all the new content. I guess that took me by surprise as well. So maybe we could talk a little bit about that and how we think about those things going forward? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I'll take that, Pat. So if you look at the pricing, you can see we did have strong absolute pricing of about $600 million and that was pretty much, if I take the stock accrual aside, that was pretty much offset by incentives. And again, I think this quarter, in terms of a run rate, is sort of more normal. Last year was the anomaly because of what was going on with the F-Series and the Oakville launch. And I think that really is influencing this because last year we largely did have \u2013 while we had the new product, we had very low levels of incentives because of how tight the inventory was at that time. So really what you've got is you've got F-Series, or F-150, which is an important product for us in terms of absolute volume, coming back to more normal levels but still better than our key competitors. So I think that's largely what is at play. We are seeing some benefit from the Edge and the MKX, although again Edge was in the first quarter of performance last year as well. So I don't think you're actually seeing so much in terms of brand-new product in this quarter versus the lack of that product in the year-ago period, which is maybe a little bit unusual in this particular quarter. In terms of the contribution cost, again I think it's the same factor. We didn't have as much in the way of adverse or increased product-related cost, new product cost, because we had F-Series largely in the quarter last year. Not a lot of volume, but it was there. Edge was there. So as a result, what you can see is the great performance the team delivers quarter in and quarter out in terms of material efficiencies flowing through. We also had some good news on \u2013 down in that warranty, freight, and other line. A lot of that was freight. We had a lot of premium freight in the quarter a year ago related to some of the launches, and so that's coming through. One thing maybe I'd take the opportunity to answer. I did say, I think it was back at Deutsche Bank, that we didn't think we'd see as much benefit on commodities this year. That clearly has changed based on what's happened subsequently to continued decline in commodities, I think. Last year we'd had, I think, it was $930 million of good news on commodities for the full year. At the moment, it looks like we were tracking to something like that. I still think we'll have a little bit more bad news on exchange this year on a year-over-year basis than we had last year, but the net of the two are still going to be a bit more good news than what we had expected. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: And just one more thing in terms of what to expect going forward. Our teams, I think, are doing a really terrific job of really understanding the consumer and what costs should we be putting in products. And I think you're seeing that path in the mix in terms of the average transaction prices. And our average transaction prices are up more than double the rest of the industry. And that really comes down to understanding the customers and putting the right costs in the vehicles that drive revenue. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Could I squeeze one last one in just on production? I think they were some comments out this morning in the press about having to reduce production in the back half, just given the inventory situation. More on that? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : What we really see in the second half is primarily around two other factors. One is normal seasonality. You've got, both here and in Europe \u2013 and in fact, in Europe you have more \u2013 the summer shutdown weeks. You also have the shutdowns that occur at the end of the year, so it's just normal to have less production, and therefore less wholesales in the second half than in the first half. It was a bit different last year because of the launches, but this is going to be a more normal year. Secondly, we've got the Super Duty launch that I referred to that will take place in the third quarter. While we'll be able to contain that in terms of down weeks within the normal scheduled summer downtime, you still have the launch curve, which is going to take some volume out. Which is one of the reasons why we're a little heavy on Super Duty stock today, because we have to anticipate that, make sure we've got enough inventory to get through that whole launch. So that's a key factor. In terms of tweaking the production for inventory, that's just going to be a normal process. We see ebbs and flows of demand in inventory and we will adjust as we go forward, but it's really those first two factors that are the key ones that are affecting us. There's not just in North America, but particularly in Europe too. Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay, thanks a lot for the color and congrats on the quarter. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Pat. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned that warning you gave intra-quarter about the $100 million headwind to Ford Credit in 1Q from lower used car prices, impact of lease residuals, etc. Yet, your profit there was strong and it rose year over year. So can you talk some more about the tailwinds impacting that business that are allowing you to offset that headwind, whether just an increase in portfolio or something else? Then, as the year progresses, what is your outlook for both the headwind from used car prices and the tailwind from the offsetting factors? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Ryan. Good morning. I think it's largely the same thing that I said at Let's Chat, which is we would expect to see sort of an adverse year-over-year from lease residuals in most of the quarters that we have ahead of us, if not all of them, although it will start to mitigate as we get towards the end of the year. So we think \u2013 and we built that in. As I mentioned in March, we do have an expectation of lower auction values and that's particularly on the car side of the business, but we haven't built that in. I think that will be on a year-over-year basis, the headwind, although again mitigating towards the end of the year. But that will be offset by strong growth of the business, not only in North America, but in other parts of the world as well. So I think that will be an offset. Again, the other thing I should mention is the team is really, really focused on cost performance. Our operating cost performance is the best in the business and that will continue to be something that will keep us lean and mean and enable Ford Credit to continue to generate the types of profitability that it has. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Yeah, go ahead, sorry. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: And then, Ryan, on your question on used car prices, obviously you've seen some of the Manheim reports. This is not a demand issue. The demand is there. It's really a supply issue as more of these three-year leases come off. We're going to watch it closely. Obviously, we've done a lot of the studies to see, are used car buyers actually cross-shopping with new cars. It's very small, it's in the single digits, but clearly it does have implications for trade-in values, so we're going to continue to watch that closely. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Then just on the 6.3% margin in Europe, obviously that's really impressive. If I go back to your last Analyst Day in September 2014, it looks like you were guiding then for 3% to 5% margin by 2020. How sustainable do you think this improvement in Europe is? I understand it's a seasonally stronger quarter, but presumably as volume continues to normalize higher over time, does that now mean there's upside to your out-year 3% to 5% outlook? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think we're going to have a great year in Europe. And as we said, even though we are off to a very good start and I think we're going to continue to have a very good year, our objective is to make Europe a very sustainable and vibrant, profitable part of our business and achieving 6% to 8% operating margin. And that's what we are focusing on. Importantly, as we do it, we are seeing a lot of the things that we've done over the past couple of years pay off. On the cost side, as you know, we reduced our capacities. On the brand side, if you look at, for example, our channel mix in Europe, we're about 6 points above the rest of the industry in terms of channel mix of retail and fleet, which is good business for us. If you look at the investments we've made in our commercial vehicle brand, we are number one, the best-selling commercial vehicle brand. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing very rich mix in Europe, which I think bodes well, particularly based on the experience we've seen over a period of time here in North America. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. Just lastly then, I'm curious with your planned new plant in Mexico and now with the really essentially complete intertwining of the U.S., Mexican, and Canadian auto markets, whether you have given much thoughts to the potential risk to your North American operations, and to the industry in general, from all of this weird rethinking on both sides of the political aisle of the benefits of NAFTA. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I can't speak to what's being said on the campaign trail. Obviously, we have these trade agreements and I think, as we look at our business, we have made a big commitment obviously here to our facilities here in the U.S. You've seen some of the numbers in terms of backing that up. Not only just the absolute numbers of what, we've invested $10 billion over the last number of years and another $9 billion going forward, of which you saw some of that announced two days ago. But, clearly, we manufacture more vehicles here in the U.S. than any other OEM and employ more people. But at the same time, we are looking at our footprint and we are seeing what does it make sense for our business? And I think we have a good plan going forward to support our growth, despite some of the political campaign chatter right now. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. Congrats again. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Rod. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I had a couple of things. First, on North America. Obviously the Q1 numbers are up a lot and, as you said, the full-year earnings will be flat, which implies some, I guess, negative comparisons later in the year. And I think you alluded to some of those drivers. It sounds like a lot of it is related to the launches. So as we think about the pluses and minuses, the last year obviously you had a pretty significant number of launches. This year you've got the Super Duty, and I presume next year is going to be the same. So as you look out to 2017 are there some drags that are being incurred right now that you think might go away as we look further out? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, Rod, I think you kind of touched on a number. When you look at our Super Duty launch, we will have the full benefit of that launch in 2017. Couple of other things, we continue to see here in the U.S. customers migrating from passenger cars into SUVs. And when you look at our lineup and you look at the performance there, we think that continues to bode well for us. I think our work overall, as I mentioned earlier, are really understanding the costs that we're putting into the product to drive mix, will be important. So I would look at it \u2013 you could look at it and say, oh my gosh, the second half is going to be weaker and that's going to run into 2017. As we said, this is kind of a normal year in terms of the calendarization of our profits and sales, but the bottom line as we get into 2017, we see continued strength based on the foundational elements of the business : product, brand, and cost. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Can you comment on where you expect to end the year with respect to inventory days, to the extent that there is some \u2013 a little bit of an elevated level in the field? Is that something that gets corrected by the end of the year? And how should we be thinking about the outlook for the non-raw-material cost inflation going forward? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In terms of inventory, Rod, as I said back in March, our expectations are that you will continue to see the inventory levels come down, particularly as we get further into the higher selling seasons in the spring and the summer. And then towards the end of the year, we always end strong, usually with the end-of-year sales as well. So I think you'll see us very, very normal by the time we get into the second half of the year in particular. So I don't see anything unusual there at all. We are a bit heavy right now on Super Duty, as I said, and then of course with the very low volume January and February sales months, the visible, if you will, of the day supply look high, but we are actually quite comfortable with where we are. So I don't think you're going to see anything unusual other than what I just mentioned. In terms of the raw materials, I think I mentioned... Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You mentioned non-raw materials. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Oh, non-raw materials. I think we have a very strong cost performance across the business this year in North America. You saw the positive news and the same thing with Europe. You will see seasonal cost increases in the second half and I think you'll see some cost increases, for sure, coming from the new Super Duty, which is normal. We'll have the product-related costs that will come through in the second half of the year, which is not unusual in and of itself, but also remember we haven't updated this product in 19 years. So we're going to be coming out with a product that's going to really set the standard and be something that we can sustain over the next 5 to 10 years. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Is that something that should be \u2013 should that be more benign than what we've been seeing with the F-Series and Edge and some of the other products that had a lot of content cost added, some of which was regulatory? Is there any color you can provide on the trajectory of that content cost related to regulatory? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We will talk more about that when we get to the launch itself. And we've got an Investor Day, which happens to be about the same time, so I think we'll provide more insight and texture at that time. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: The only thing I would add on that, on the Super Duty, is just look at our performance on F-150, in terms of the content that we put in it and what it's driving in terms of revenue. Even in the quarter, the F-150, our average transaction price was up $1,700 year-over-year, so customers are really seeing that value. And that's the same approach the team is taking on Super Duty. Rod A. Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Galliers of Evercore. George Galliers - Evercore ISI : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Two questions. The first one just on China, you reported a nice step up in the JV margin, which remains at a very strong level. What do you see as the sustainable margin for your China JV over coming quarters? And do you see improvements in mix and structural costs effectively compensating for lower net pricing or could margins move higher still? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think we'll see very strong results for the course of the year, George, from China. I think the margins, I don't know if they will be at 16%, but they will be double digits. They will be very, very strong. I would suspect. It might be different by quarter because you get calendarization and volatility by quarter, but I think by the time we get to the end of the year, as we have shown in recent years we'll have very, very strong margins. I would add, when you look at that number and you look at the Asia Pacific results, you go what am I missing? The China JVs is not the total China profit for Ford. We incur engineering that we absorb and are reflected in the results for the region that we don't recover from the JVs until we actually start producing the vehicles years later. We're launching Lincoln. We've got other allocated costs that sort of, sit at the regional level that you wouldn't see there. So China very profitable for us and improving year-over-year, but I think you'll kind of, see very strong performance in JVs over the course of the year. How are we offsetting the effect of negative pricing? That's through a lot of cost efficiencies through the business and then we have been benefiting also from the very, very strong mix that we have and I think that will continue through the course of the year. George Galliers - Evercore ISI : Okay, thank you. And then also just with respect to Europe, I was wondering if you could give any indication on what Brexit, if it happens, might means for Ford given the importance of the U.K. market and your fixed cost basis and what strategy or plans do you have in place if it does indeed happen. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, George. Well, when you look at the issue around the Brexit, obviously the U.K. is a very important market for us and what's important for us as a business is stability, particularly stability in trade, and that's important because that allows us to continue to build a strong business in the U.K, for the over 14,000 folks that are part of the Ford team there. And that's why our position has been that it's beneficial for the U.K. to be part of a single market, a reformed EU. In terms of what may or may not happen, we'll apply the same approach in the U.K. as we do in every other part of the world. Our aim is to keep up our businesses globally competitive. So wherever that referendum comes out, we'll do that. George Galliers - Evercore ISI : Thank you very much. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Thanks, George. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, John. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just a sort of a simple question on North America. I mean, when you look at the guidance of 9.5% or higher, that would, at the low end of the range, indicate a sort of, a mid-to-low 8% EBIT margin or pre-tax margin for the remainder of the year. As we think about this, and I know there's a lot of puts and takes and there's seasonality here, what I mean, should we kind of, focus a little bit more on the higher component of 9.5% or higher, or do you think that 9.5% is something we really should keep in our thought process? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, again, let me just restate what the guidance says. It's not 9.5%; it's 9.5% or higher. So we do see upside potential from where we were last year and so we just need to let the year play out. We're in the first quarter. There's a lot of moving pieces, a lot of things that we have to manage. We will have, as I mentioned, lower production, which is normal. In the second half, we will have a launch, which will have an effect in the second half with all the benefits to come later, as Mark mentioned. But we think that we'll come in at 9.5% or higher, and I know Joe and the team are working as hard as humanly possible to make sure that we continue to get everything out of that business unit that we can and they certainly did in the first quarter. So we feel super good about where we are in the quarter and we'll have an extremely strong year. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: And we'll provide updates on this at the end of the second quarter when we do the second quarter call. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yeah. That's very helpful and thank you. And then on Europe, you kind of alluded to Russia not being as big a drag in the quarter. I was just curious, if you could put Russia in context in the European business, sort of, size and potential stability and recovery there because it seems like the rest of Europe is firing on all cylinders and if that ever stabilizes, as you could even see some real upside to Europe. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Yep. (51:54) Just to put it into perspective from just a sales standpoint or a share standpoint. In Europe in total, our share was up a couple of tenths to, I think, about 8% in terms of market share. In Russia, we actually doubled our market share in the quarter from a year-ago period. We were about 3%. So you can do the math and see the impact from a volume standpoint. But our approach, as you know, in Russia going forward, we view that as it's going to be -- it's an important market. It will recover over time and the investments that we've made both on the product side and the distribution side and just the business structure itself. I think it will position us well for when the market does start to come back around and that will happen when commodities start coming back around. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I think it is a really good point. That is one of the, sort of, on its own a big profit opportunity for us, when the commodity cycle starts to turn. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just lastly on slide 24, you gave us some great incremental data here on financial services at Ford Credit. As we look at the, sort of, the slight extension in terms that are happening in the industry but don't seem to be happening for you and then also look at, sort of, the percentage of loans that are above 73 months. Can you talk about what's going on with credit scores and the consumer that's being offered extended terms? Because it seems like that's only occurring in high credit quality consumers. And also maybe, if you could just comment on prepayment speeds as you've seen an extension in terms, because I think they have been picking up. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I'll just give a high-level comment and then we'll let Marion supplement. What we are seeing and you touched on it, and I think we talked about it at Let's Chat, we are seeing these customers have very, very high FICO scores. These are really high-quality customers. The other thing that's interesting is we are seeing them come out of that contract early. They don't hang into the bitter end, if you will. And so we are also not seeing any signs here or in Canada, which is about 10 years ahead of us in terms of this trend, in terms of extending the trade cycle. So right now it just looks like these customers recognize it as being a good deal and they are taking it, but then they don't necessarily hold on to it as long as the contract would allow them to. So you're right in that the industry is higher. I think it is like a 17% mix or something like that. That's around these 73 months terms. We are not participating in that. We actually are offering in very small volume even 84 months. That's something that is out there as well, but again, I think you'll see us trending well below the industry as that trend continues. Marion, do you want to add anything? Marion Harris - Chief Financial Officer : No, I think you covered everything, Bob. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, everybody. Really strong quarter. Question on for Smart Mobility LLC, I think that you made some really important efforts to identify some of the opportunities as the industry changes and to put some of these technologies within a kind of captive company. The question is, is there a rationale to take the LLC and to separately capitalize it or create a tracking stock or some form, which has been done by large companies in the past in your industry and in others, as a way to kind of find a mechanism through which to attract and compensate employees that would be -- that you would be recruiting in that battle for talent that could be done in a more customized way outside the scope of the traditional forces that affect an auto industry's and auto company's performance? And I say that seeing thing, your stock up, you posted an incredibly strong result. Your multiple is still really, really low. Stock is up a percent and change. At some point does the capital \u2013 the mechanism through which you can raise and attract capital need to match the mission, if you follow? Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Thanks, Adam. And those are some really interesting thoughts. I think, first off, the reason we set up the LLC to begin with is we wanted it to be what I call separate, but connected, which is to allow the Ford Smart Mobility group to have the organization and the structure to face off with some of the tech and mobility companies in terms of acting really fast. And I think going forward, it's still way too early to kind of talk about some of the things that you mentioned. I wouldn't put them off the table, but at the same token, what's really important is this Ford Smart Mobility group is working very tightly with our core operations. And I guess where we're at on Ford Smart Mobility, we are very focused, Adam, on where to play and how to win. And as you know, we are generally using experiments and pilots to, not only test technology and customer preferences, but very importantly test the business models, because at the end of the day you want to make money on these things. And we're doing that before we make, what I would call, major bets on investments, whether it's internally or externally. And we'll have more to say about this as our Ford Smart Mobility strategy progresses this year. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I appreciate that and look forward to hearing from Mr. Hackett. Can I just have one follow-up about the cycle? Many industry leaders, including yourself, Mark, I think have made statements like and I'm not direct quoting, but that the automobile will see more changes in the next five years than in the last 50 years. If you just take that at face value, and first, do you believe, say categorically with that kind of sentiment? But if that's even order of magnitude correct, what does that mean for the potential for a super cycle of unprecedented replacement of vehicles in the park now that might become obsolete a little faster than in the past? Where do you come out on this with your team? Is this good for SAAR, is this this urgency to replace and that buying a car is a life-saving decision? Or does it gets stunted by the fact that you have maybe trillions of dollars of used cars out there that where the equity is kind of stranded and creates a credit problem as people, trapped in that equity, that negative equity? Thanks. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Thanks. So there's a lot of kind of aspects to that question. I do think \u2013 I do agree \u2013 we've said that we are going to see \u2013 we're at an inflection point as an industry over the next number of years, given the technology that's available, not only in the product itself, but how to serve the customer. So when you look at the \u2013 your comment around is there going to be a super cycle, listen, I mean there's hundreds of millions of cars, over 100 million cars here or \u2013 I can't remember exactly the numbers. There's a lot of cars here in the US. It's going to take a long time, even with breakthrough technologies, where people will change that over. Just the math will show you that will take a good amount of time. And in terms of what technology, whether it's autonomous, or semi-autonomous, or all the connected cars will do for the industry, what is it going to mean? From our standpoint, we're looking at this \u2013 first off, it's too early to tell, but we're really looking at this as vehicle miles traveled. And you could argue that in urban areas there may be less car density, either because of costs or just outright legislation, not allowed to use personal vehicles, which could dampen car sales. But also, at the same time, if you make something more available and you make it less expensive, it's used more. And if you think about things like autonomous vehicles that will be used 24/7, they'll rack up miles sooner, which will drive, as I mentioned earlier, more service revenue and, ultimately, more car sales. So I think it's still too early to tell. But our strategy, very clearly, is to continue to make the investments on the technology side and the investments on the mobility side so that we can participate in both of those revenue streams. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Mark. This makes a lot of sense. Cheers. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: All right. Thanks, Adam. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Just want to go back to sort of more of the next five years in terms of North America and Europe. We seem to, as you've noted, had this heavy shift towards CUVs versus sedans; seems to be creating what some might call a sedan recession. So as you think about your mid-term capacity plans, putting aside NAFTA and political issues, just where do you think you need more CUV capacity? Do you have, and I know I keep coming back to this question, more ability to get additional factories to be able to flex between the two product lines? And then, as you kind of look across the industry, do you see maybe a risk of too much capacity coming in to the CUV category? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So on the CUVs or SUVs, in terms of flexibility, clearly we've said, for example, we're going to come out with four SUVs in actually new segments over the next number of years. And what we're seeing, Brian, around the world, literally around the world, is this migration from passenger cars to small and medium and large-size SUVs and CUVs. So, clearly, our planning going forward is looking at the marketplace and making sure that we're there for consumers in that. So I think you'll see that here in the U.S. You'll see it in Europe and you will see it in Asia Pacific as well. In terms of your comment of will everybody be going there, well, I think that's the nature of the business right in terms of understanding where consumers are going. And that's why I keep bringing back to our strategy of how we are differentiating ourselves on fuel economy, safety, quality, and smart technology, and using our brand. And if you think about this, Brian, whether it's CUVs or SUVs, this really plays to kind of the sweet spot or really a strength of our brand. And we are seeing it now in our results and I think that will bode well going forward. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And will you be reducing car capacity and do you think \u2013 and will others do it such in a way to take some pressure off the car pricing? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I can't speak to others, but clearly, as I mentioned, when you think about the number of SUVs that we're going to be adding, you could see us do that. With the caveat, our approach as a company is to offer a full lineup of vehicles and that's for a couple of reasons. Obviously, one, to anticipate any changes in customer demand, any changes in the economic environment, or any changes in the regulatory environment. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And final question on this shift. What happens when someone comes in with a five-year-old car, maybe a Japanese brand car, that hasn't held its value and they're looking to get into one of your CUVs, are you hearing anything from the dealers about the need for trade-in allowances, underwater loans, or something to help that car buyer get into \u2013 car owner get into a CUV? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I mean, we're not hearing anything above the normal kind of commentary we get from dealers on that, so nothing above the normal. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Means they always want money? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. That was the politically correct way of saying it, yes. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston of Morningstar. David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thanks, good morning. Just one question on leasing and one question on Europe. Bob, your comments on leasing mix for Ford, if I heard right, you said it's going to be going down, your penetration will be going down throughout the year and I just want to know how much of that is a function of not having, say, AA type of credit rating versus standard residual value risk management and related, do you think the industry is being too excessive in its leasing penetration right now? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : For us it's -- we do have what we call the One Ford Lease Strategy, so we've got a lot of analytics behind what we think is the right and appropriate level of lease. We look -- because we are really -- we want to make sure we can support what the market needs, but we also want to make sure that we are managing the concentration of risk. We think that at 26% that will be sort of a high-water mark for us this year. And some of it is seasonal. When you get into the summer selling season, it tends to be much more of a \u2013 it's a retail season and it's very much around APRs and that sort of thing. So there is just a natural change that occurs in certain times of the year. But that's one of the reasons why we think when we get to the end of the year we will be at something probably a little above last year, but below where we are right now. And we think that's the right level given where the market is. The other thing I would mention is that, for us, there's a much lower percentage of leasing, in Ford anyway, on Super Duties and F-150s, on trucks, that has not been \u2013 that's been generally true across the industry. Although some of our competitors got pretty heavy on that in the first quarter in some of the regions of the country, we didn't participate in that. So I think that's another factor as well. It's just our natural mix of product. David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thanks. And on Europe, if I heard right, you said 60% of your passenger vehicle volume was on the high end trim packages, which is impressive. I was just curious is the European customer trading up in price given an economic recovery or are you just attracting wealthier customers than in the past? Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: I think it's a combination, David, of both of those things. David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Thank you. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli of Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning and congrats, everyone. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Thank you, Itay. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Maybe just to continue on Europe, I mean given the improvement in mix and pricing, and I know there's a lot of political uncertainty out there, as well, for early in the year. But could this be a year where Q1 contributes, maybe what it used to contribute in terms of the quarterly cadence back in 2005-2006 when you were profitable in Europe? I mean what prevents this from being sustainable? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we think it is sustainable. I don't know if it's going to be sustainable at the margin, because we would expect again going back to what's normal. The second half in Europe is generally not as strong as the first half because of the summer shutdowns and the end of the year shutdowns, that seasonal cost effect that comes into play. But, yeah, we think that we're going to have a good second quarter. We think we'll be profitable throughout the year and we're going to have strong results in Europe. But we do think that there will be a first half stronger than second half story, but it's still going to be a great story all throughout the year for Europe. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Which again is a normal kind of cadence of our profitability. Nothing unusual. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Absolutely, that's good to hear. Then maybe just going back quickly to North America. I know you alluded to year-end inventory targets. I know you don't provide an annual North America production outlook, but as we think \u2013 I think your first half was up about 11% in North America production. Any kind of ballpark of how we should be thinking about the full year in terms of a range or kind of roughly where you think you might come out as you manage through the launches and some of the inventory? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I don't think we want to provide a guidance for the full year because we still have a lot of year left in front of us. I think we're just going to continue to manage the production in line with demand. You can see on Appendix A9, the call for the second quarter for North America, 850,000 units, that's up 35,000 from where we were a year ago and pretty much in line with where we were in the first quarter. So, I don't see anything unusual in the year progressing. Again, you'll have lower volume in the second half, for the reasons we've talked about throughout the call, just seasonal and also the effect of the Super Duty launch. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thanks so much. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak of RBC Markets. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi. Congrats on a really strong quarter. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks Joe. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : First question is on commodities. I believe back in Detroit, you'd mentioned it would be a fairly neutral for the year. It was obviously up by almost $0.5 billion in the first quarter. Is there a change there? Or given that commodities are coming back up a little bit, do you expect to maybe give back a little of that in back half? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : What I said at the Deutsche Bank conference was that we would have favorable commodities on a year-over-year basis this year versus last year. It just wouldn't be as favorable as what it was in 2015 versus 2014. Getting to the neutral point, that was, the point that I was making was, that we have favorable commodities, not as great as last year, but we'd also have more headwinds from exchange in 2016 than what we saw in 2015. So that was the neutral bit. It was good news commodities would be offset by bad news on exchange. What I said earlier in the call, Joe, is that now we see commodities as being more favorable than what we thought, because the prices have continued to fall. So I think we will see commodities about as much of good news, based on where we are today, as we saw last year, which was over $900 million. But we will still have more bad news on a year-over-year basis from exchange. So the net of those two, while it will be positive, won't be as positive as it was in 2015 versus 2014. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay, thanks for the clarification. Then on Europe, it sounded like mid or long-term there is a little bit of a bump to that margin target, 3 to 5 to 6 to 8. Is it fair to think that maybe 1.5 or 2 points of that 3 points is related to the pension accounting change and then maybe 1 point is just from some better operations or mix outlook? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Certainly the elimination of that drag that we had on pensions, which we were relatively unique compared to our peer set, that certainly helps. But actually what it is, it's our view of what we can get out of the business from a performance standpoint of change. The team has done a really, really good job on all the various aspects of the transformation plan, product, brand, and cost. And we see more potential now in terms of driving the business to the types of margins that we need than where we were perhaps two years ago. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: To put that into perspective, Joe, again we're using this momentum to really drive us towards those margins. Not only is the product launches that we have this year, but we're looking at the product portfolio we have. We are focusing on the products that have high growth and high profitability, and we will drop products that actually don't have either of those characteristics. At the same time, we are going to continue to work on the costs. As we've said before, we have a voluntary separation program going on right now in Europe which when all is said and done, should save us around $200 million a year annually going forward. So we're going to continue to work every element of that to make sure it's a sustainable and vibrant part of this. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And I would just add. When we had that conversation in 2014, that was only about two years into the plan. So we didn't fully see the potential that we are now seeing from the business. The aspects of the plan are very much the same. It's just the team is really, really delivering and we see a lot more potential now for Europe than perhaps what we had before. Joseph R. Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a great quarter. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Thanks, Colin. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : I understand the comments about second half getting weaker from a seasonal cadence perspective, but how should we think about quarter-over-quarter? You are going off record margins in North America, you had $600 million accrual in Q1, and production in North America looks flat. So should Q2 also be a very strong quarter? And the same thoughts on Europe, it looks like production is even up quarter-over-quarter. Should Europe actually maintain a very strong level in Q2 and then fall off in the second half? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The only thing that I will say about the second quarter is we expect it to be strong, but I don't want to get into calling quarters because I'm always wrong. But it will be a strong quarter. The first and second quarter, again going back to this theme around what's normal, they are the stronger quarters of the year. I would expect that to be the case this year. So we'll have a strong second quarter. I won't characterize it any way other than that. And then we'll have the seasonal effect in the second quarter, along with the product launch impact. And then a really, really strong year. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Is there anything unusual in Q1 that we should be aware of going in North America and Europe that actually helped it out but that won't reoccur? Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I'm glad you asked that question, because there is actually nothing in the results in any of the business units that you would consider to be unusual. This is really quality earnings right across the board. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And any color on \u2013 I saw in the press release you mentioned Ford passed this rolling out. How has that rollout gone? Is that going to be something you are going to advertise going forward? Any just color there on that launch? Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: What we're doing, Colin, right now is, we should be launching that in the next month or so and we are very excited about it. Think about, we will obviously communicate it, because we think it really provides a way for us to have a fundamentally different relationship, not only with our customers, but customers that don't own Fords. And so what you will see is, think about it this way, it's a launch, but then we'll be continually improving it to improve the experience for our customers. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much for the color. Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Colin. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Keith Naughton of Bloomberg. Keith Naughton - Bloomberg LP : Good morning. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Good morning, Keith. Keith Naughton - Bloomberg LP : Hey, Mark, there has been some headlines recently that have said that the Ford did not plan to offer a 200-mile electric car to compete with the likes of the Tesla Model 3 and the Chevy Bolt. And I just wanted you to clarify, does Ford plan to offer a long-range electric vehicle? Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Absolutely. Our approach, very simply, is we want to make sure that we are either among the leaders or a leadership position in the product segments that we are in. And if you look at our BEV today, our Focus has about a 100-mile range and that is very competitive for the price point that it's at in the marketplace right now. And that's why, as you know, we've made the announcement late last year where we're going to invest another $4.5 billion into our vehicle lineup on electrification. And by the time we end the decade, we will have 40% of our nameplates around the world that will be electrified and they will be very competitive from a cost, quality, range standpoint to allow us to move the business forward. Keith Naughton - Bloomberg LP : And will your long-range electrical vehicle go 200 miles and when will that come? Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Well, our electric vehicle will be, as I said, it comes down as we want to make sure we are among the best or the leaders in those areas. So in that timeframe, when you look at some of the competitors, what they've announced, clearly that's something that we want to \u2013 we are developing for. Keith Naughton - Bloomberg LP : Thank you, Mark. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: Thanks. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I would now like to turn it back over to Mark for any closing remarks. Mark Fields - President, CEO & Director: No. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: Eric J. Selle - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Garland Buchanan - Legal & General Investment Management America, Inc. Operator : Good morning. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Second Quarter Ford Credit Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the floor to Stephen Dahle, Associate Director, Ford Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Dahle, I hand the floor to you. Steve Dahle - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, LaTonya, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either via phone or webcast. On behalf of the entire Ford management team, I'd like to thank you for spending time with us today. With me this morning are Bern Silverstone, Ford Credit Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Marion Harris, Ford Credit Chief Financial Officer; and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer. Before we begin, I would like to review a few items. As a reminder, we've moved the format of this call to focus only on Ford Credit's earnings and we have expanded the content of our communications to provide increased disclosure on topics for which we commonly receive questions from the fixed income investment community. All automotive-related questions should be directed to the Ford Equity Investor Relations contacts, as detailed in the Ford press release. I'd also like to remind everyone that we posted our Ford Credit University slides on our Investor website on July 15. These slides contain helpful information for investors to better understand our business and financial reporting. We welcome your feedback and questions, as we strive to improve our investor communications. A copy of this morning's Ford press release and the Ford Credit earnings slides that we will be using on our call today have been posted on the Ford Motor Company's Investor and Media websites for your reference. The Ford Credit Investor website also contains the slides. The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. The final data will be included in our Form 10-Q. Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to the U.S.GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck. Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford Credit's future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risks and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly and current reports to the SEC. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Credit Chairman and Chief Executive, Bernard Silverstone. Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: Thank you, Steve. Let me add good morning to everyone, and on behalf of Marion, Neil and myself, thank you for dialing in or indeed joining via webcast. So, today, we will review our results for the second quarter and we'll look at key metrics and trends for the business, bring you up to speed on our funding, of course, and as usual take your questions. So we can get started if we can turn to slide one, where you should be familiar with this. We talked about this slide last quarter, but I did want to quickly touch on it, again, today, really to reinforce our focus on running our business with clear operating principles executed by our very experienced team. Consistency and discipline continue to define our origination practices and world-class customer service. Additionally, strong risk management and focus on business fundamentals are cornerstones of how we run the business and they really underpin our results. So if we can move to slide two and we will start the review of some of those results for our operations for the second quarter. So as you can see, in the second quarter, we made $400 million of pre-tax profit. Now that was lower than a year ago, but is still a very solid result and that puts us at more than $900 million in pre-tax profit for the first half of the year. Also, our receivables were up as we continue to grow in line with expectations and you'll see later how our worldwide credit losses were actually down for the second quarter versus the first quarter, but here you see that in the U.S. market our loss-to-receivable ratio was higher versus the second quarter last year. However, the loss-to-receivable ratio remains close to historically low levels and consistent with our expectations for this stage in the ongoing recovery, it continues to edge closer to the longer-term trends. For placements, our average placement FICO scores \u2013 just to remind everybody \u2013 this is one component of what we use for proprietary scoring models, but it remains very consistent and strong, and U.S. delinquencies, although slightly up, remaining at very low levels. So, starting on the next slide, Marion will go through the results in more detail. Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: Thanks, Bernard. On slide three, you'll see our $400 million of pre-tax profit. The decrease from the second quarter of last year can be attributed primarily to unfavorable lease residual performance, higher credit losses and a couple of factors in the category we call other. Partial offsets were favorable volume and mix. These were driven by growth in finance receivables globally, plus operating leases in North America. Unfavorable lease residual performance primarily reflected higher supplemental depreciation in North America related to lower expected auction values on smaller vehicles in our lease portfolio. The higher credit losses reflected higher charge-offs in North America and an increase in the credit loss reserve. The higher charge-offs reflected increased defaults and severity, as well as growth in receivables. Other reflects a few items, including higher storm-related insurance losses and unfavorable derivatives market valuation following the BREXIT vote. The slide four shows North American financing share and contract volume. Financing shares were down slightly in the second quarter and first half from the year ago periods. The lower retail and lease financing shares were driven by marketing programs and the lower total contract volumes from the second quarter and the first half are more than explained by lower retail installment and lease financing shares. Turning to slide five, this shows our financing share and contract volume for our international operations in the second quarter and first half. In Europe, share was largely unchanged from last year and in China, share and volume were higher related to marketing programs. Total contract volume was higher primarily reflecting higher financing share in China and higher industry volume in Europe. Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: So just on some of those quarter-over-quarter movements that we can see in these share metrics just to give you a little bit more texture. In the U.S., the reduction in share mostly reflects the lower leasing share, which is consistent, in fact, with the outlook that we talked about at the end of the first quarter. And of course, we're always reviewing marketing programs to understand customer needs and market trends and then respond appropriately, which means that it's also quite normal to see quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in share. And additionally, looking at China, we continue to see a gradual increase in market acceptance of credit, as a means to acquire vehicles and that's particularly true amongst younger customers. Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Bernard. So turning to slide six, you'll see placement FICO in the U.S. in the second quarter was up slightly from the first quarter, and our average FICO scores remain very, very consistent. And as Bernard mentioned earlier, FICO is just but one component of our proprietary scoring models. As you know, we support customers across the credit spectrum and our higher risk mix has been running consistently around 6% in recent quarters and has been stable for over 10 years. Our average retail term remained largely consistent with recent periods and lower than the industry. So slide seven shows our U.S. retail and lease credit loss metrics, as we continue to come off an extended period of extraordinarily low credit losses. Delinquencies at 12 basis points remained at historically low levels and repossessions were up slightly in the quarter from the second quarter a year ago. The severity increase in the second quarter from the prior year primarily reflected lower auction values, higher balances at repossession, and higher amounts financed. Severity has been relatively flat from the first quarter. Our charge-offs and loss receivables ratio were higher year-over-year and that reflected primarily higher defaults and severities. So, now on slide eight, as Bernard mentioned earlier, our worldwide credit loss metrics remain very, very strong. Worldwide LTR in the second quarter was higher than a year ago, reflecting primarily U.S. retail and lease business that we covered on the prior slide. The credit loss reserve was up from a year ago, primarily reflecting credit loss performance trends. The reserve as a percentage of managed receivables was also up from the second quarter of 2015. So on slide nine, our lease placement volume in the second quarter was about the same as last year's second quarter, but our lease share continues to run below the industry. We continue to expect our lease share of retail sales to be lower than the first quarter. Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: I just want to mention here that, as we've talked about before, just to remind everyone that our placements and shares continue to be managed as part of our overall One Ford Lease strategy and we've referred to that before because that's where we work with our Ford partners to plan leasing considering things like share, term, model mix, all those things that we've got unique insights to. And in fact, it helps us balance sales and residual values in the future and of course, as we've also emphasized before, our focus on the trade cycle so that we've got satisfied customers and a sustainable leasing program. As you know, the industry of leasing stayed about flat and we've taken a more proactive approach, we believe, by managing down our lease mix, as we indicated in the first quarter. We think this will help address some of the supply concerns around returns of off-lease vehicles given the growth in leasing these past few years. Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: Okay. So, on slide 10, you'll see we had 62,000 units of lease return volume in the second quarter. This was higher than last year and reflects our higher lease placements in recent years, as well as an increase in the return rate. Our used vehicle auction values in the second quarter were lower than a year ago, but have been flat from the prior quarter \u2013 past couple of quarters, in fact. Although, Manheim reported an increase in used vehicle values in the quarter, our results reflected a larger mix of two and three-year-old smaller vehicles, which have had lower auction values. Our mix of newer vehicles is just a subset of the broad range and age of products that make up the Manheim Index. Let's go to slide 11. Slide 11 shows our trend in funding of our managed receivables and at the end of the second quarter, managed receivables were $134 billion, up $7 billion from the year-end, and our securitization funding was about 35% of managed receivables. And as we've said in the past, we continue to expect the mix of securitized funding to trend lower over time as our unsecured funding becomes a larger part of our funding structure. However, the calendarization of our funding plan may result in quarterly fluctuation of the securitization funding percentage. Our funding strategy really continues to center on having a very strong investment-grade balance sheet with ample liquidity and funding that's diversified across markets and channels and investors. Just one other thing I want to point out on this slide. You will note that we are no longer providing a range on year-end managed receivables and funding structure and that reflects the recent regulatory changes around the use of non-GAAP measures in guidance. So turning to slide 12, this slide shows our public term funding plan, and we are off to a terrific start this year, and we've completed more than two-thirds of our full year funding plan with only just halfway through this year. And for 2016, we do continue to project funding in the range of $27 billion to $33 billion. This is a bit tightened on the range from the first quarter and both the amount and composition of our full-year funding plan are consistent with our issuance in 2015. Turning to slide 13, you can see our leverage and liquidity metrics. At the end of the second quarter, our financial statement leverage was 10.2 to 1 and our managed leverage was 9.4 to 1. We target managed leverage in the range of 8 :1 to 9 :1 and our managed leverage was above our targeted range reflecting the recent growth in receivables and the continued impact of a strong U.S. dollar. For liquidity, we target at least $25 billion to protect against downturns and market disruptions. Our quarterly levels can be affected by near-term debt maturities, receivables growth, timing of transactions and other factors like that, but we feel very good about the very strong liquidity we have. So with that, I'll turn it back over to you, Bernard, to wrap things up. Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: Great. Thank you, Marion. So if we could turn to slide 14, here we show that we now expect our pre-tax results to be lower than 2015, which is really impacted by the higher ongoing depreciation reflected in our expectations of continued lower auction values on smaller vehicles. We do expect, however, that second half pre-tax results will be about in line with our first half results. And as you've heard earlier in the Ford earnings call, both Ford and Ford Credit are already finding improvement actions and working to mitigate some of the risk that we discussed. Also, on this slide in terms of Ford Credit working to return leverage towards our target range, one of the initial actions we've taken is to continue to change our plan for distributions and you can see it's consistent with our first quarter guidance. So, now we go over to the takeaway slide, slide 15, before we turn to your questions. But before I actually go through them, just wanted to touch on the British vote to leave the European Union, as I know that is certainly on many people's minds and to mention at this stage we continue to monitor the developments closely and assess any impact on our business. And of course, we will act appropriately under any new regulations that result as and when we understand and what those are going to be. So, now just to summarize our performance. We've had a solid second quarter and first half. We know expect our pre-tax profits to be lower than 2015, reflecting the increased depreciation charges that we've mentioned throughout this presentation. We do, however, expect our second half pre-tax results to be about in line with the first half results. So, as always, we remain focused on disciplined and consistent execution to support sustained performance, all based on a very strong balance sheet. So that's how I report out. Steve, back to you. Can you open the line for questions. Steve Dahle - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, Bernard. We will now start the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, we will only take Ford Credit questions on this call. Automotive-related questions should be directed to the Ford Equity Investor Relations contact as detailed in the Ford press release. LaTonya, may we have the first caller, please? Operator : Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Eric Selle with SunTrust. Eric J. Selle - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for the time again. I kind a hitting on the lease share, and I do appreciate how you guys have \u2013 I think Mark said it on the last call \u2013 you guys are always very early to react, which is why we appreciate color from you guys because you guys are always honest and early. You guys are decisively giving up some lease share. Financing is still available to you. The auto side needs support. Is this a Ford Credit risk-adjusted return decision looking out at the ALG guide? How was this made to move away from the lease market? And is it something that the other financers are going to pick up the slack because there's so much growth in that area? Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: First, Eric, thanks for joining us, and thanks for your question. So I think I can relate it back to really as we talked about our One Ford Lease strategy. So it's definitely a joint approach to how we think about leasing. I think one of the keys also to underpinning that is our view that leasing has to be sustainable. Not to go back to 2008 and 2009, but you know what happened there. So we're taking a long view in terms of the dimensions we've talked about and they spit out, if you like, some concentration parameters for us and we've used those in aggregate to look at our overall lease share. So we may be giving up some leash share in the short term, but would it be good lease share in the long term? When those customers come back in two or three years' time, if there isn't a comparable lease program, then it's really not sustainable. One of the main benefits, of course, is the loyalty we see, the satisfaction we see, as well as the near-term impact on sales. So we are certainly going to be present in the leasing market at the right level, but we are managing this to make sure it's also sustainable and that when those customers come back at the end of their lease, we can have a good experience and offer them a new product again and hopefully enjoy the kind of loyalty we've always seen from our leasing presence. Eric J. Selle - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I appreciate the holistic view. I've worked at a bank for 20 years and I always tell my bankers it's easy to initiate a loan; it's hard to sell it. So, obviously, short term/long term is obviously appreciated. Looking in the States, it's obviously well-advertised and well-expected, sedan glut concentrated with the Japanese and Germans. How can they come in and support residuals? We're hearing stuff that they are getting a little bit more conservative on some of their structures. How can they \u2013 because I feel like if they support the residuals, some of the overhang goes away. Are you seeing them come in and really come in and support some of that residual risk? Anything they are doing that would help bottom that trough, and kind of how are you all looking internally at that sedan glut? When does the glut kind of peak and kind of move through the snake, per se? When is the worst of it? And are you seeing any of your J3 or G3 captive competitors step up to support the residual risk that they have because it seems like it's more pronounced over there? Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: I'll kick off on that one and just say that I think you can see it on the numbers on the page there that the industry is still running higher than we are certainly running, so clearly the marketing offers there are presumably being supported in terms of as you say the residuals that are being held out. When that eases, I think it's back to the disciplines we talked about in the earlier call, that if the industry holds its discipline, if indeed the pattern that we are seeing is across the industry in the various segments, and you've called out a couple of segments that I think are very valuable and clear insight on your part there, then you'd think there would be an adjustment. But clearly we don't have insight to their specific plans so I can't give you a call of when that will change. We are taking our own actions and you can see it in our numbers there that we've moderated our leasing programs to make sure we can be there through the cycles. Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: Eric, this is Marion. I would just say that where industry leasing is today is about the peak of where it was almost 20 years ago. And so our view is that, at those kinds of levels, it's a bit too high. And as Bernard said, we have to manage our own business and we do that through our One Ford Lease strategy and you want to keep it at such a level that you are not getting people into cars with so much Motor Company subvention that it gets them into a car that they really probably shouldn't be in as opposed to a different, a lower price point vehicle. And you see that. You see it in the luxury segment. Sometimes when folks are chasing share, they will do very aggressive lease programs and they'll support the residual very strongly and in the end that ultimately results in a bunch of returned leases that run through auction at lower prices and over time kill the brand. Eric J. Selle - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: We've all seen the One Ford work through the cycle, so as a credit guy, we appreciate it and I do appreciate your time today. Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: Thanks, Eric. Good to hear from you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Garland Buchanan with Legal & General. Garland Buchanan - Legal & General Investment Management America, Inc.: Hi. Thank you for taking the question. Can you just confirm, of the remaining $2 billion to $4 billion issuance recorded out of Ford Motor Credit, how much of that is expected in the unsecured market and the tenor views there? And then another question, in terms of rating migration, you've communicated a desire to go upward. Do you think that you need to get through the cycle in order to get that upgrade, or is that something in your conversations with the agencies that you see as possible going into a downturn or even in a downturn? Thanks. Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: Yeah. I'd say, I'll start and then kick it very quickly over to Neil. If you look at our slide 12, this shows in the forecast for our funding plan. So we have somewhere between $2 billion and $6 billion left to do in unsecured and you can see it broken out by region and then what we need to do left in securitization. So that gives you some guidance on where and how much is left to do. And then as it relates to tenor and rating agency questions, I will ask Neil to comment. Neil M. Schloss - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, I think on the tenor question, which I think we both look at the market, but also manage our maturity profile to fit into where we are not overly concentrated in any one calendar year or calendar quarter for that matter. And so we've issued these things sort of three years and 10 years, manage to an average maturity sort of in the middle there, but then we also look at the market from a standpoint of where best to issue. And then on the ratings, I think your guess is probably as good as ours from the standpoint of what it takes. I think we continue both at credit and auto to manage to a, single A credit from a standpoint of our balance sheet. We think we are there. You look at some of the metrics on both leverage for the company, as well as for Credit and they would, based on the rating agency metrics, would say we are single A. So it's getting the business there and obviously getting through a cycle being able to maintain our funding, being able to maintain our base dividend would obviously go a long way to supporting a higher credit rating. Garland Buchanan - Legal & General Investment Management America, Inc.: Okay. So I'm sorry, to confirm then that slide 12, if you just look at the $2 billion to $4 billion issuance remaining, that does not include commercial paper? That's correct? Neil M. Schloss - Ford Motor Co.: Correct. This is unsecured term and secured term. Garland Buchanan - Legal & General Investment Management America, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot. Bernard B. Silverstone - Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC: Just to add a little bit of flavor on this page is something that I think underscores some of the values that we've espoused into how we run the business. If you look in the middle there at our European operation and what they funded through July, you can see how we approached having the contingencies in place for Brexit, not knowing how the vote would go, but really having a great step forward on the funding. I think it more talks to the values we espouse about being a consistent player and making sure we are fully funded and that's why we've got the strength of the balance sheet that Neil just referred to. Neil M. Schloss - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, and specifically on the CP side, we ended the quarter with about $4 billion of commercial paper outstanding, which is up from where it was at the beginning of the year, in part because we now have a two rating from all of the agencies, which obviously creates new demand for us on the short-term programs. Garland Buchanan - Legal & General Investment Management America, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. Mr. Dahle, I will turn the floor to you for closing remarks. Steve Dahle - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, LaTonya. With that, I would like to conclude today's call. As a reminder, all of the information that we reviewed today is available on our Investor website; and thank you to all who joined us today. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

(Research) Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and thank you for participating in the Ford Motor Company Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ted Cannis, Executive Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ted Cannis - Ford Motor Company : Thanks very much, Victoria and good morning, and welcome everybody. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's third quarter 2016 earnings review. Presenting today is Mark Fields, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer; also participating are John Lawler, Vice President & Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President and Corporate Treasurer and CFO Ford Smart Mobility; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Marion Harris, Ford Credit CFO. As usual, copies of the press release and presentations are available on our website. And also as usual, there are some non-GAAP references and those are reconciled in the appendix to the GAAP measures. Today's discussion includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance, actual results may vary. As a reminder, Ford Credit has a call later today at 11 A.M. to discuss third quarter results and later today, we'll be filing our 10-Q and based on some of your feedback, we've added some supplemental information to help with the analyses that some of you've requested and that's on pages 54 and 55 of the 10-Q. And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Mark. Mark? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Thanks, Ted. Good morning, everybody. In the third quarter, we delivered our better than expected company adjusted pre-tax profit of $1.4 billion, which was lower than a year ago, as were all the other key metrics. And the decline from last year was due to North America and this reflects the impact of the Super Duty launch, F-150 stock changes and increased warranty cost from the door latch recall that we announced back in September. Now, during the quarter, in addition to the all new Super Duty, we also launched the all new Lincoln Continental and I'll talk more about these as we go through the call. Looking at our global market share, it was down slightly and we had improved share in Asia Pacific and that was offset by results in North America, South America, and Middle East and Africa. Turning to Europe, we had our best third quarter profit there since 2007, and it also was our sixth consecutive profitable quarter there. Looking at Asia Pacific, we saw strong growth plus our best ever third quarter profit. Ford Credit remains strong with the best quarterly profits since 2011. And as we step back and we look at the first nine months of the year, our pre-tax profits and our cash flow were strong and about the same as we generated a year ago. Now, we expect the good news versus our guidance that we delivered in the quarter to be offset in the fourth quarter. But stepping back and looking at the full year, we continue to expect to deliver one of the best profit years ever for the company, and that's a full year company adjusted pre-tax profit of about $10.2 billion. Now, if you turn to slide 4, you can see we're having a continual focus on the four drivers of shareholder value and that's really around growth, risks, returns and rewards. And looking at growth, we launched several key vehicles and helping fortify our core business with strong reactions from customers as evidenced by the record third quarter retail sales that we recorded in China and for the overall Asia Pacific region. We also announced our intent to have a high volume, fully autonomous vehicle in commercial operation in 2021 in either a ride-sharing or ride-hailing service. And we also, during the quarter, completed the acquisition of Chariot, which is a San Francisco-based shuttle service that we now plan to grow globally as we work with cities to help solve their transportation issues and also provide importantly new sources of growth for Ford. In terms of returns, our profitability at Europe, Asia Pacific and Ford Credit were strong, and we continued our focus overall on making sure that we deliver cost efficiencies, net of economics across the business, as we once again in the quarter delivered favorable cost performance versus our plan and that's despite the large recall in the period. In terms of risk, we contributed about $200 million to our funded pension plans. And in terms of rewards, we distributed regular dividends of $600 million and that's part of our ongoing strategy to deliver attracted dividend to shareholders that we can then sustain through the business cycle. And just looking year-to-date we rewarded shareholders with $2.9 billion in distributions. Slide 5 shows some of the additional highlights in the quarter, and I'd like to just touch on a few of these. Our new Lincoln Continental is off to a strong start and we're also receiving a lot of positive feedback from customers in terms of delivering on our quiet luxury brand promise. Our new Super Duty just won the important Truck of Texas award, which is particularly significant given the importance of this market to our truck franchise. Moving over to Europe, we launched our new KA+ which is imported from India as we work to improve the profitability of our small vehicle business and the initial feedback on the KA+ has been positive. And we also announced a number of important collaborations and investments in autonomous vehicles and mobility services, all of which position us as a solid investment in the near-term with an attractive upside in emerging opportunities. So, let's turn to our view of the global business environment and you can see that on slide 6. Global growth remains below trend and that's due to recessions in key emerging markets, as well as some constraints on business investment spending. Looking at the U.S., growth is improving after a weak start to the year. And in Europe, we expect moderate economic growth and continued monetary policy stimulus to support industry volume. Just looking at the UK in particular, the economic data have improved from the initial Brexit shock, but the tone of the recent statements regarding the timing of exiting the EU have contributed to additional sterling weakness. And in China, we expect continued growth supported by government stimulus. And just moving to Russia and Brazil, incoming data are pointing to economies that appear to have passed the low point of their present cycle. So, with that, I'd like to have Bob take us through our performance and I'll come back to cover our outlook. Bob? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Thanks, Mark, let's turn to the next slide, slide 8. This is our key financial summary and I want to start by just base-lining this with some of the key data. So we'll start with the third quarter, in the first column, I just want to highlight several metrics. So, first, company adjusted pre-tax results of a $1.4 billion. Net income of $1 billion. Go further down the page, adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.26 and then the operating cash outflow of $2 billion. So, as Mark said, these were all down from a year ago, and this was consistent with our expectations. If you go further down the page, you can see in terms of our cash and net cash balances very, very strong, and cash above our target of $20 billion. Now, we're going to go through a number of these things in detail through the deck, but two things I want to highlight that we won't talk about again, if you go back up above sort of the middle of the page, you can see we had very few special items on a pre-tax basis this quarter, only $26 million, and that was related to separations, and our effective operating tax rate in the quarter was 25.9%. And if we move over to the first nine months, the year-to-date column, the third column. Just to highlight the strength of the results, $8.2 billion so far this year in terms of company adjusted pre-tax results, $5.4 billion of net income, $1.46 of adjusted earnings per share, and then very strong operating cash flow of $4.9 billion. And as you can see, in the comparison versus a year ago, all of those are pretty much in line with what we did a year ago, which was the best year that we've had in our history. Okay. Let's go to slide 9. And now, we're going to start to peel back the onion a bit in terms of what happened in the quarter for the business, and these are all absolutes. You can see the $1.4 billion to the left, and let's look at the segment results, $1.1 billion, in terms of Automotive, you can see that at the top of the chart. $550 million from Financial Services. And then all other is primarily our central Treasury Operations $223 million negative, that's primarily net interest expense and portfolio gains or losses. That is also where we put Ford Smart Mobility, but nothing material in the quarter to talk about. Now, if we go back into the Automotive segment, some things to highlight here. If you look at North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, all profitable, South America and Middle East and Africa, losses. If you go below the chart though I think this tells the story of the quarter. If you look at the total company, down a $1.7 billion, it's essentially North America. So, when we get to North America slide, this is really where the story for the business occur in the quarter versus last year. Now in terms of guidance, let me just touch on that. Here we had guided you, this quarter being about $1 billion million which is 10% of our outlook for the full year, we did come in better, our view of that is it's simply, a re-calendarization of some items from fourth quarter into third quarter and vice versa. And it's really around marketing accruals. There's about a $100 million of good news in marketing accruals in the quarter that will offset in the fourth quarter. The balance is a number cost changes, cost improvements that took place in the quarter, but it is $20 million here, $40 million there throughout the whole business. We don't see any signs of that changing the run rate of cost and that will be offset in the fourth quarter yielding the same outlook for the full year that we had back at Investor Day. Okay. Let's go on to the next slide, slide 10. This is looking at the key metrics of the Automotive segment. So just kind of running across the page, you can see wholesale is down about 4%, revenue down 7%. All business units were lower with the exception of Asia Pacific. Our share was down one-tenth of a point, North America, South America, Middle East and Europe all lower, Europe was flat, Asia Pacific was higher. If you look at the SAAR, the SAAR was actually up on the global basis that was driven by Asia Pacific and Europe, the other business units or regions were lower. Our operating margin and PBT were down sharply, that was driven by North America. Now one of things I want to touch on here and I'll mention it again when we get to North America. We have included in our operating results the effect of the door latch recall, which if you recall from our 8-K that we issued is around $600 million. Not all companies do that, some companies will treat that as a special item. We included it in the operating results because it is a normal course of the business, although clearly something of this size is unusual. So to help you understand more the run rate of the business, if you were to exclude the recall from our operating results, the margin that you see here of 3.3% would have been 5%. And if you go down below the page, you can see the year-to-date metrics 7% would have been 7.5%. I'll say the same thing when we get to the North America slide. All right, let's go slide 11, and this looks at what's changing on a year-over-year basis. You can see we're down $1.7 billion, this was driven by volume declines that was largely around stocks, some share, a little bit of industry and then of course, the impact of the recall and you can see that in the warranty item in the callout box for the contribution cost. I do want to mention net pricing, this is the first quarter we've had this year, a positive net pricing. This was primarily in North America, but we did see net pricing in all regions with the exception of Asia Pacific and that decline was just a usual downwards overall industry pricing \u2013 negative pricing that occurs in that market. And we'll talk about that when we get to that slide. All right, let's move on to the regions and we'll start as usual with North America on slide 12. These are key metrics. So going across the page, volume was down 11%. This was stocks primarily, negative change in stocks, market share, a little bit of industry. Revenue was down 8%, that was driven by volume. Market share was down 0.5 point, now within that, that's the region. Canada was actually up 1.6 points, Mexico was up three-tenths of a point, the U.S. was down seven-tenths of a point, that's what drove the overall region. And within the U.S. that was around a retail decline, that was cars and utilities, and it was fleet, and that was more than explained by rental. F-Series in the quarter was flat on a year-over-year basis. When you look at the SAAR, it was down about two-tenths, 200,000 units for the region; that was more than explained by the U.S. consistent with our view of an eroding but high plateau, it was down about 0.5 million units, but still coming in at a strong absolute level. Both retail and fleet in an absolute sense were down on a year-over-year basis. Margin and PBT were down sharply, but again if you go back and look at the margin, if you exclude the recall, the 5.8% would have been 8.4%. So, it's still a very healthy margin and that's including the effect of the Super Duty launch in the quarter. If you go down to the year-to-date metrics, which again are very, very strong, the 10.1% would be 11% on a year-to-date basis. Okay. Let's move on to the following slide and this is the slide that essentially explains the whole company. So, North America down $1.6 billion; there are three things that are happening here. Now, I'll go through them in order of magnitude, but they're all roughly about a third of the entire decline. The first impact is a Super Duty launch and so this is the effect of less volume, but also launch cost that always comes along with the launch. So, that's the first effect, something that we talked about at Investor Day. The second item is around normalization of F-150 and so when you look at the normalization of F-150, there's two things going on. If you go back a year ago, we were coming out of the launch of Kansas City towards the end of the second quarter. So, in the third quarter, we were restoring the pipeline at the dealers. The units that we were selling were essentially all retail, no fleet, and we had very, very high mix. In this particular quarter, we have a normal balance of retail and fleet units, a normal balance of series mix and options, although still very strong. And we actually have a stock decline in the quarter versus the stock build that we had a year ago, as we continue to maintain our production alignment demand. And then thirdly, we had the door latch recall, which was a bit less than $600 million. So, those three things effectively explain the entire change in North America, which explains the change that occurred in the company. I do want to highlight the positive pricing, this is the first quarter we had positive pricing in North America and this was across many of the vehicles in the portfolio. Obviously, Super Duty one aspect of that, but it was not the key driver, it was a major factor, but not the key driver. So, that was a very positive effect. And you can see on the far right, we did have \u2013 continue to see higher average transaction prices. They were up about $1,300 a unit. That was nearly twice the industry average. But we did see within that a continuation of higher incentives across the industry, but our increase was less than the industry. In terms of guidance for the full year, we're now looking at North America coming in at a margin of 9% to 9.5%, that's because of the door latch recall. If we were to exclude that, North America's margin would be over 9.5%, which is consistent with our original guidance at the beginning of the year. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: And just a couple of comments on the market in the U.S. here. Our view is the industry is at a relatively strong level, but the retail market is softening and the pricing environment is getting tougher. And as you've seen and as we've communicated previously, we have taken some production adjustments on a number of selected models to match production to demand and that's consistent with our strategy. We do expect some further actions in the fourth quarter and that will be primarily related to Fusion and Focus and Escape and one fewer crew next week building F-150 at Kansas City. And then our approach on incentives, Bob mentioned incentives in the industry, our approach is to be competitive and disciplined, and I think, as you've seen in certain segments in the last few months, when the competition has increased incentives, we prioritize margins over market share, and you can see that in our results. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Let's move on to South America. In South America, the key metrics shown on this slide, slide 14, you can see both for the third quarter and year-to-date, all the metrics were lower. This is driven by the external conditions in South America, which remain challenging. Although I will say that we are starting to see a number of the economic indicators that while they're still negative, they're starting to turn upwards. And so I think we feel comfortable that at least direction of the economies in South America seem to be moving in a positive direction and supportive of our view that we could see next year the first positive growth, although very, very modest compared to where it's been in the past, but that's a positive sign. If you look at the metrics, the top-line is lower, that's driven both by volume and the weaker currencies. Our market share was lower, that was due to Fiesta in Brazil. And in terms of SAAR, South America itself was down 400,000 units or 10% that was entirely driven by Brazil, which was down 400,000 units or 17%. Turning to the next page, looking at what's behind the $132 million decline. In South America, it's a very, very similar pattern to what we showed you in the first quarter and second quarters. While we're pricing as aggressively as we can, you can see that it's not enough to offset the effect of high inflation, as well as negative operating exchange effects. The volume and mix is a bit lighter than what we've seen in the past, but we're still going after cost improvements. And you can see that we generated nearly $100 million in the quarter that was both contribution cost and structural cost. In terms of guidance, we continue to be on track to a loss for the year that would be greater than what it was in 2015. Okay. Let's move next to Europe, which is a very nice story. As Mark said, this was a great quarter for us, it was the best third quarter that we've had since 2007. If you look at the operating margins and profits up very sharply, I'm going to go right to the year-to-date numbers at the very bottom of the chart to the far right. We have already earned in the quarter \u2013 or in the year over $1 billion and that number will get a bit better as we go through the fourth quarter. So, we feel extremely good about what's happening in Europe. The team has done a wonderful job and it's showing up in the results. And that's despite the fact if you go to the left, we're starting to take actions in response to anticipated reductions in demand in the UK as OEMs start to price in response to the weaker sterling. We certainly announced a price increase, a number of others have. In the quarter, our wholesales were down, our revenue was down, that was driven by those actions, although actually in the quarter, the SAAR of the UK was unchanged, but we think that will change over time as those price increases start to take hold. Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change in Europe. So, up $130 million, you can see the impact of the stock adjustments in terms of the volume. We did continue to see very, very strong mix that was both favorable product mix as well as series mix and options, good cost performance on contribution cost that was driven by material. Good news on exchange, we're fully hedged on an operating basis. This is the non-recurrence of bad news on the balance sheet a year ago. But the other thing I just want to highlight is all the way through here in various categories we're seeing continued positive performance on a year-over-year basis of our Russia business. So, Russia seems to be recovering a bit ahead of where South America is, but very pleased to see the continued performance by the team in that part of our business. In terms of guidance, clearly we're on track for a result that will be significantly stronger than our profit a year ago. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: And just a little bit more flavor on Brexit impacting the UK because obviously we get a lot of questions on that. As Bob mentioned, so far, we haven't seen a major impact on the industry. We've seen retail down slightly, but that's offset by increasing fleet deliveries. And in fact, if you peel that back a little bit, we've seen a lot of strength in the commercial vehicle market and especially the van market, which obviously plays to our strength with transit, which once again was the number one commercial vehicle in the UK and also across Europe. What we are watching though is pricing. And as Bob mentioned, we, as well as our other competitors have taken pricing in the UK and that's obviously to compensate for the weakening of the sterling. And our view is that this is what will start to be negative for the market as we close this year and we get into 2017. So, we're getting ahead of that as Bob mentioned from our production actions. And in addition to that, we're working all elements of the business to mitigate the potential negative effects on the market. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Let's move on to Middle East and Africa. This is the only slide as usual that we have for this region. This is an unusually large loss for us. If you look at the first quarters and second quarters, we averaged a loss of about $50 million. And so let me explain what's going on here. So, if you go across the page, you can see wholesales and revenue are down, that's driven by industry changes and the impact of that on our volume, as well as the revenue. Our share was lower, although if you just look at the markets in which we participate, that's code for exclude Iran, which is the largest market in the region, our share was actually flat. What was happening is, the markets we participate in were declining and Iran was growing. So, it's a geographic mix effect. What's happening in terms of profitability is issues in the Middle East and specifically in Saudi Arabia. That country is transitioning its economy or trying to transition its economy from one that's a very oil-based to one that's more diverse pulling back on subsidies. It has an impact on our performance in the quarter. We are working very hard to address those issues. We think we'll be back on track in terms of a more normal result in the fourth quarter. Probably a loss still, but much, much less than what we're seeing here in the quarter. But year-to-date you can see that all the metrics are down, but we would not expect this level of loss to continue in the fourth quarter, nor do we see this as a run rate. For the full year, we expect to have a loss in the region compared with a small profit a year ago, but again think about the pattern of the loss based on the comments I just made. Okay. Let's move onto Asia Pacific. This is another really good story. And if you go back to the second quarter call, if you remember we talked about performance issues in China and then and Mark, I think had some commentary around the actions the team that were working to address that. And I think I have to tell you they really, really responded beautifully. You can see here, wholesale is up 30%, the revenue is up 16%. The share improved and that's not just in China, we had share improvement in Australia, ASEAN and India. So it was pretty broad based. The margin and profitability are up sharply. And that was not just China. We also saw improvements, in fact most of the improvement is coming from outside China. But having said that, if you look on the far right, towards the bottom, our China JVs did contribute on an equity after tax basis $320 million of profit. That was up 26% or over $60 million and our margin came in at 13.4% which was an improvement of seven-tenths a point from the year ago. So we feel really, really good about what the team delivered not only in China, but broadly across the region. Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change and our profitability of $100 million and you can see, it was driven primarily by volume. If you go across the page, you can see the negative pricing that occurred in the region, this was driven by China. In the quarter, the industry was down about 4% or so, we were up a bit more than that but it is moderating as we go from quarter to quarter to quarter, consistent with what our expectations has been at the beginning of the year. So, when you think about the guidance for the year, we do expect a profit, a good profit in the region, but it will be lower than it was at a year ago and that's driven by the effect of the negative pricing in China as well as the weakness of the renminbi. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: And just as Bob mentioned back in the second quarter call, he mentioned that we expected our third quarter to show improvement and the reason for that is, we're going to really leverage our new product launches and also step up our go-to-market strategy. And as you can see from the results, we had market share improvement, importantly, we saw sequential market share improvements literally every month, and also then the increased profitability for the quarter. And as we look forward, obviously we're now in the fourth quarter, we want to build on that performance with our new model launches, we'll have a full quarter of the freshened Kuga, we have the Mondeo coming in the quarter and really take advantage of what we see being actually a strong industry in the quarter, with the purchase tax incentive coming to an end at this point. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Let's turn to Ford Credit on slide 21. Great results in Ford Credit in the quarter $567 million, that was up little bit from where we were a year ago. If you go below the third set of bars, you can see the year-to-date numbers just under $1.5 billion. Our guidance for the full year continues to be about $1.8 billion. Going back to the metrics, you can see the business continue to grow that was across all regions and all products. And if you look at some of the data we have to the right around the portfolio. Performance of the portfolio continued to be very, very good. The LTR continues to rise, but still below what we would consider to be a normal level, it's probably more around 50 basis points to 60 basis points. So if we go the next slide. Looking at what drove the change on a year-over-year basis, it was the higher volume and the favorable mix. You can see that credit losses continued to be down on a year-over-year basis, this was driven by higher charge-offs and our lease residuals also were down on year-over-year basis and that was driven by, as you can see in the call-out box, our outlook for lower auction values particularly in smaller vehicles and small utilities going forward and the impact that has on the vehicles still in our portfolio. Let's go over to the next slide. We'll get some more metrics around Ford Credit, just want to highlight the top two. So on the upper left, you can see auction values, our auction values continued. They were down $235 sequentially looking at the 36 months, which is the majority of our portfolio and on a year-over-year basis, down about $535. The decline that we've seen so far year-to-date in our portfolio is very, very consistent with what we've seen for the industry if we adjust the industry to our mix of products. If we go to the far right, in terms of lease share of our retail sales, you can see that the industry itself is trending down although at a very high level, we're trending down more so, coming down to 18%. We guided earlier this year that we expect to be about 20% for the full year and we think we'll still be more or less around that level. And this decline reflects our view of residual values and the impact of that on the business also and recognition of the fact of the very high lease rates that we've seen over the last number of years against a very high level of industry sales. There's going to be a lot of units coming back over the next several years. And so, we're adjusting our lease trends in response to that. Okay. Let's move now to automotive cash flow. And you can see here, towards the middle of the page, the $2 billion negative cash outflow. This was driven by the changes in the working capital, largely around payables associated with the adjustments that we made particularly on stocks and then you can see there is also an adverse effect and timing differences, again that was related to the stock changes, any impact that had on the marketing accruals. If you go further down the page, you can see that our funded pension contributions came in at $200 million. We're actually changing our guidance for the full year. On pension contributions, we expect to contribute about $1.2 billion versus the $1.5 billion that we've guided to, that $300 million difference will be paid in 2017. Dividends came in at $600 million and as Mark said, $2.9 billion of distributions to our shareholders for the full year. Okay. With that, we'll go to my last slide, which is around the balance sheet. So, I just want to highlight here the metrics that we shared with you last time, we're still looking very, very good for the automotive business as well as Ford Credit. I would like highlight the pension performance, you can see $7 billion in terms of a funded status but I just want to remind you that we will re-measure our pension assets and liabilities at year-end. So, this reported number does not reflect the impacts on the decline in interest rates that we've seen throughout 2016. I will say, however, because of all the actions taken over the last number of years to de-risk and to fund our pension plans, we expect only a very modest deterioration in our funded status at year-end 2016, that will largely be outside of U.S., because we're ahead of the overseas market in terms of getting those plans funded. So, with that, that concludes my comments and I'll turn it over to Mark. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks Bob. Okay, if you turn to slide 26, this sums up our industry and also our GDP planning assumptions. And all in all, we see some risk to global GDP growth, as you have things like policy uncertainty including what's going on with Brexit negotiation, that adds to existing weakness that we see in global trade flows, but also in just business investment spending in total, and this is offset partially by steady consumer sector in most of the major markets. So today we're updating our global GDP guidance to 2.9% and that really comes in at the low end at the prior range that we guided. For industry volumes, we are providing some upward adjustments, slight upward adjustments for China and Europe with a small downward adjustment for Brazil. Now, as you've seen, we have had a strong first nine months for the year, and we continue to expect 2016 full year company adjusted pre-tax profit, to be about $10.2 billion and again, an outcome that would be our second best since the year 2000. And just kind of bringing in it all together, if you go to slide 28, we are on track for one of our best profit years ever as I mentioned, but that's following a third quarter that was better than expected, but lower than a year ago, as we guided. We successfully launched the all-new Super Duty and also the Lincoln Continental in North America. And importantly, we're taking the actions to address the continuing challenges of what we see is a plateauing U.S. retail industry, higher incentives in the U.S., and of course uncertainty in Europe due to Brexit. Bob mentioned our cash and liquidity are strong, and we continue to deliver a robust regular dividend that we're committed to pay through the business cycle. And as we outlined at our Investor Day that we held last month, the entire Ford team, we remain committed to our strategy and also our roadmap to grow our business as we expand as an auto and a mobility company. And this includes fortifying and building on our strengths, and that's trucks and vans, the performance vehicles, SUVs, Ford Credit and of course our parts business. Transforming parts of our business that have traditionally underperformed and that includes luxury small vehicles and emerging markets. And we're growing emerging opportunities in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility, that will define and also differentiate the future of our business. So, with that, why don't we just open it up and take your questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Good morning. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: A lot of investors have been struck by the difference in sort of optimism versus pessimism between yourselves and one of your neighbors. Just a couple of things. One, could you maybe highlight where you see kind of the market going in 2017? Do you think there is risk of further downside? And two, once we get past these dealer stock reductions, how you're looking at the market in terms of fighting for share versus letting it drift down to where it might naturally go? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Brian. First off, I would call our approach realism, not optimism, not pessimism, it's realism. And we've \u2013 number of us have been through a number of cycles, and we're looking at the data and big part is interpreting that and what it means for our business. So, I think as we look at the market going forward, as you look at the balance of this year in the fourth quarter, we expect the SAARs will probably about the same as last year but with retail being down. And then as we get in \u2013 and with that a tough and more competitive pricing environment. And you can see that in the data that we're all looking at today. You're looking at incentive levels on an absolute basis go up. They're in the industry, they're going up as a percent of MSRP. As we get into 2017 as you know we've guided to an industry that will be slightly down. I think it was 17.7% for next year and then 17.5% for 2018. So at relatively strong levels, we don't see a recession on the horizon but we do see a marketplace that from a cycle standpoint, it's mature. And we're starting to see the evidence of that and I think we're being very proactive in looking at these pieces of data and taking I think very prudent actions and realistic actions for our company. And as you look at your comment of fighting for share versus pricing, et cetera. It's always a balance. We want to optimize our profitability and we want to optimize our market share and you've seen, look at the latest quarter, last quarter here in the U.S. in the full-size pickup segment. We saw a lot of variability in incentive spend and even in that environment, our retail share of the segment was even and it's up year-over-year. We spent the least incentives in the segment and have some of the highest transaction prices. And that's the approach that we're going to take going forward as we see the market go wherever it wants to go. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: If I can, the only thing I would add is, we're also seeing a maturing credit cycle. You can see that with the used vehicle values. So I think that's another sign or signal in terms of \u2013 we are just at a different part of the cycle. Again not bad, but just a different part, yeah. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And just a quick follow-on question to that, Bob. You \u2013 I'm struck by the pullback in leasing at Ford Credit. Do you think that's having an impact in the showrooms or you are you using other promotional tactics to kind of keep the consumer there? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I think \u2013 Brian, this is Mark. I think as Bob mentioned upfront, naturally we wanted a lower rate, because you just look at the mix of our products, right, we sell more trucks and vans, which you know tend to lease less, we have a less of a percentage of luxury sales. And as Bob mentioned, we previously guided, beginning of the year, about 20% was about right. In terms of looking at, is it impacting in the showroom? You could say it's having some level of impact. At the same time, we do have an opportunity to take those funds we would spend on that and port them over to maybe some retail incentives. So, yeah, in general it probably has some level of impact. It depends on the region, obviously depending upon the leasing concentration, but probably modest at this point. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Just hoping we can follow up a little bit on kind of the big picture pricing view on North America. You're cutting production, it looks like by 12.5% in the fourth quarter. So, it looks like you're really positioning to have very tight inventory by year-end, but at the same time it looks like GM's production gets in the \u2013 almost the 100 days over the course of Q4 and Q1, and as you mentioned we're seeing some pretty aggressive incentives from Fiat Chrysler. So, I guess my question is, when you're positioning and talking about this strategy, and perhaps willing to accept lower market share but protect profitability, does that strategy kind of vary on a product by product basis? I know you're adding quite a bit of content here on some of these vehicles, particularly the pickup trucks. So does that limit your options, vis-\u00e0-vis pricing competitiveness? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: No. I think overall Rod, our strategy is pretty consistent across the segments. As I mentioned upfront in Brian's question, it's always a balance of optimizing pricing and market share. And that's the approach we take pretty consistently across the patch on all of our segments. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just a data point on Europe and China. Could you update us on what your updated view is on the Brexit impact now with the pound where it is currently? And on China, you mentioned that you're expecting a little bit of a decline; obviously the pricing and the RMB. Could you just remind us of how you are thinking about the magnitude of the pull forward that's occurring now and how that kind of plays out as you look out, maybe preliminarily, on 2017? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah. Let me just \u2013 I'll start and Mark can supplement. So, in terms of Brexit effect, so what we saw in the second quarter just to remind you, we took a $60 million hit related to the balance sheet, because of the weakness of the sterling that occurred after the vote on the 23rd. We then said we'd see about $140 million of impact in the second half of the year and that was around actions we would take in anticipation of lower industry. So, we've already started to do that in the quarter. So, we start to make those stock adjustments. So, as I mentioned, Rod, in Europe, even though the industry hasn't yet actually declined, we started to take stocks down, so we had a stock reduction in the quarter versus the stock build a year ago. We announced a price increase, gross price increase of about 2.5% on September 1. A number of other OEMs have announced as well. So, I think that will be the beginning of what will be a chilling effect on the industry; we're just getting ahead of it with the adjustment. If it turns out not to happen as fast as we're expecting, then we've got the ability to react to that, so we'll be very flexible on that. In terms of looking at 2017, consistent with what we said at our Investor Day event, we think the effect is probably about $600 million. So, think of that as the adjustment in terms of industry being about double what we said for the second half, on a full year basis, and the balance is around sterling, and if anything there could be potentially some risk on the sterling, given how weak it became following the Tory Conference, and the comments from Prime Minister May. But we already are about 80% hedged in terms of our operating exposure at this point in time for next year. So, we still have a little bit of exposure, but you know we're comfortable right now with that $600 million. If you look at Asia-Pacific, in terms of what's happening with pricing, and the year-to-date, the industry is down about 6% as best we can tell. We're down about 1 point more than that, but we've seen that moderate; we talked about that in the second quarter. And we saw that continue to moderate in the third. In the third quarter, industry year-over-year was down about 4%. I think we were down about 5%, and sequentially I think it was down about 1 point, 1.3 points. So, we are seeing a decline of \u2013 the pace of the decline in pricing. We've built that into our outlook. You want to add anything to that? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: No, it's good. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, you believe that the price deterioration will moderate as you look out into 2017, just despite some expectations of maybe currently we're benefiting from pull forward demand? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, we think there'll be some moderation. Our assumption \u2013 we've mentioned this before, our assumption is that, the purchase tax incentive will not be extended. We'll have to wait and see. I think there's some conflicting signals now coming from the government. That's our assumption, but again, we're prepared to respond if that's not the case. I think I would also \u2013 it's interesting you mentioned that what we've seen is because the Chinese renminbi is now part of the IMF basket of currencies. It's actually weakened as the sterling has weakened, because they're trying to balance the renminbi versus that currency and the effect it's had on the basket. So, interestingly Brexit has actually had an effect on us in Asia-Pacific. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Rod. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Good morning, John. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I hate to follow up on this question again just on pricing. I mean, it does seem like pricing in the quarter was very strong for you guys. You are being very aggressive on adjusting your stocks to demand with these production cuts, but you are also \u2013 it looks like you've gotten pulled back dramatically on leasing as well. And it looks like you are playing the game of holding up pricing, both on the new vehicle side and on the residual side, and taking a hit on volume and playing sort of the long game. And I'm just curious; as you think about these pricing decisions, I think everybody is focused on inventory production and pricing actions by competitors in the very near term. But as you think about this, I mean, how does the residual value now in the next three to five years play into this decision process? And are we seeing something that is a little bit more balanced short term and long term thinking now? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, John, we always think of both as we make these decisions. We're just standing back and again looking at the macro factors. And Bob mentioned this, when residual values are extremely important to our customers and they're extremely important to us, and we're just looking at the physicals, right? We are looking at an industry, where it is in the cycle. It's mature, the retail industry is coming down, we're looking at the levels of leasing and the number of leasing vehicles that are coming back this year and projecting out over the next two years or three years. They're going to get to levels that we have never seen on an absolute basis in the industry before. So, that's telling us and informing us and saying, we need to get ahead of that. And that's our philosophy in terms of how we're looking at this, we're looking at the short-term data, we're looking at the leading indicators and that's informing our decisions, both in the short-term and the long-term. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, it's not an either or, we're just trying to balance and try to find the optimal mix, which is constantly shifting, because it's a dynamic competitive environment. But that's what we're doing and that's what we always do. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : It's refreshing. Just a second question on Ford Motor Credit. You cited volume and mix as being a pretty significant positive in the quarter. I'm just curious what was driving that, given volumes were down on absolute terms on volumes. Are you seeing a higher penetration rate and are there other products that you are using that would drive mix positively there? Just trying to understand what's going on. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, one thing I'll mention and then I'll have Marion talk about, which is kind of interesting and I think I've seen some reports on this. We are seeing more Chinese consumers, finance their vehicles and we're participating in that as well. So, we did see more contracts in China as we saw a greater percentage of our customers that we finance, that were going up, and maybe Marion can provide some color and texture. Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co.: Thanks, Bob. So, John, Bob is right, we have seen growth in all of our products globally over the last year, remember this is the portfolio business. So, we had good growth during 2015, which then shows the year-over-year growth in 2016 over 2015. So, but Bob, sorry, we did have a record quarter in China and we continue to see volume growth there, but it's been around the world as well. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Then just lastly on pension contributions $1.2 billion versus your previous expectation of $1.5 billion. It sounds like some of that is spilling over into next year, but how should we think about pension contributions going forward, Bob? Is this the kind of thing where you are largely done or are we going to see sort of $500 million to $1 billion numbers going forward? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, what we've said is, recently we said $1.5 billion this year and then $500 million to $700 million, it depends on the year going forward. We don't have to make that $300 million this year, so we're not going to, but we will next year. So, it just moves to the next year. So, think about this year $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion next year, let's say instead of $700 million, it's $1 billion. That's kind of the dynamic that we see. And then going after next year probably in that $500 million to $700 million range, it will depend on the year. John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Great, thanks for taking my question. Given Q3 came in better than expected, what is the key reason that guidance for the full year didn't come up slightly? Is it the Q4 production cuts; was that not part of your thinking earlier in the year or? What are the key drivers? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah. Let me take that one. It was \u2013 we thought it was a $1 billion, that was our forecast, it came in stronger. And when we kind of peeled back and looked at what was behind that. So, the first thing was we saw marketing accruals came in about $100 million light or favorable in the quarter, but when we look at the physical, it's just timing that will reverse in the fourth quarter, so that's not going to change anything. And then the rest, it was really around cost performance. We got about $300 million of cost performance across the regions and across the business. And when we pulled it back, it was $20 million here, $30 million there, $40 million, I mean there wasn't any one big thing and so, as we looked at it and discussed it with the regions I think the view was, it was just timing. So, fairly we've had a huge pressure and focus on cost reductions and hopefully that was also what drove it, but there's nothing compelling that would tell us that the full year is going to come out any differently, so our point of view now is it's just timing. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And It sounds like your view on the US market hasn't changed. Has the mix outlook changed at all with the F-150 production cuts? Does that imply that you think pickups may weaken or is that just response to the competition? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I think when you look at the segment in the quarter, it's relatively strong, maybe not grown as strong as we expected but I think it's against the backdrop, Colin, of \u2013 listen we're still in a strong industry, pickups in general are still strong. If you look at just September, we had our strongest retail F-Series month of the year and when you look at the demand, obviously as I mentioned earlier, we saw a lot of variability in incentives spend from the competitors and that said when you look at the metrics on how we're performing in terms of incentive spends, transaction prices, et cetera, the response to the new Super Duty and transaction prices literally near the top of the industry. We feel pretty good about the full size pickup segment, but at the same time you have to think about it in terms of overall we're seeing in the industry in terms of some weakening in the retail end and we'll keep watching it and that's why we're being proactive around our stocks. We want to protect that brand, we want to protect that franchise and we want to protect the residual values for our customers. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Going back to Ford Credit, very strong quarter there. Any color on the sustainability of that number though? I think it was the highest since 2011. Is there something unique in the quarter or it seems like you've been cautious on that business, yet it was pretty good. Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co.: There was a \u2013 I think the only thing I would highlight was sort of one time in the quarter Colin, and if you go to slide 22 and look at the call-out box you can see we got $41 million of good news in terms of derivatives, which is just it happens in the quarter, may or may not continue on \u2013 it's tied to interest rates. So, that was unusual. When you look at the balance of the year, we're not going to have a strong quarter in the fourth quarter and the team will talk about that in the call at 11 o'clock, but that is largely around what's happening it's going to continue to happen on residual values. The only thing I would highlight that will be unusual in that quarter, that doesn't change the company results, it's just a payment that's going to go from one part of the business to the other, which is about $80 million payment that Ford Credit's going to make to Ford of Europe. And that's around funding the gap that we have and one of the plans in \u2013 pension plans in Europe that Ford Credit's going to satisfy, and then Ford Europe will actually kind of manage that going forward, and so that will be a shift of $80 million between the two. It will affect Europe's or rather Credit's results, but has no impact on the business, it will be good news in Europe. And I'll talk more about that and give you more flavor at the 11 o'clock call. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : And Just one last question. China margins again were very, very strong, I think 15% net income margin. How do you think about that the next year in an environment that may be flat with pricing pressure? Are you going to be able to find cost offsets or should those margins moderate a bit? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, you know, as Bob mentioned as we look at the pricing environment in China, it's been negative for quite some time, that's our assumption going forward and what it means very simply Colin is making sure that we continue to bring out new and fresh product, that's what's driving the performance that you see in the recent quarter in terms of either it's our new MKZ, or Taurus, or Everest or the freshening of the Cougar that's driven there. And as we think about going forward, the continual focus on costs not only structural costs within china and Asia Pacific, but material costs particularly after we launched the products and as you know once we launched the products we have a lot of efforts on material cost. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks Colin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : Hi. Good morning everybody. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Good morning. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : I wanted to get a little bit more color on the North American pricing performance in the quarter. As you pointed out, this is the first positive quarter for pricing and it clashes a little bit with comments around increasing incentives and pricing environment getting tougher. And so any color on what has been going right this quarter and how to think about it going forward? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah. I think when you \u2013 if you go to slide 13, I think it is \u2013 which is the North American year-over-year details. As you can see in the call-out box, we did have an increase in incentives, it's just that we had more favorable impact on the pricing side. When you look at the details of it, it was \u2013 obviously we got some good news on Super Duty, although frankly the number of units we sold in the quarter was pretty modest because of the timing of the launch, but we have some good news there. But the rest of it was just the guys pricing \u2013 taking pricing opportunities where they saw them across the portfolio. I mean there was good news across quite a number of our products particularly as we went from 2016 model year or into the 2017 model year that they're starting to just be able to eke out if you will and collectively generated the type of result that we did, it wasn't really so much around any one thing or big launches or whatever, it was very widespread across the portfolio. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : And so, looking forward? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: So, looking forward, I wouldn't talk about next year, I think, we could see some continued positive pricing in the fourth quarter, I don't think it would be anywhere near this level, but it could be a little bit positive. But I don't think it will be as positive. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, that's great. Then just on Europe; so you were mentioning some of the dynamics around Brexit and I think you said you are 80% currency hedged for next year. I know it's probably very early to look at beyond next year, but at the same time I guess 2018 is when you have been suggesting your earnings would sort of go back and increase again. What does the Brexit impact look like on the \u2013 once those hedges roll off? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I don't know because I don't what the exchange rates will be, I mean we'll have to see. And in fact one of the things I just want to remind you and remind you all is, we not only hedge out for next year, but we already have some hedges in place, and 2018 obviously much less so than 2016 or 2017, but we've got somewhat 2018 already protected. I think, it's a big uncertainty \u2013 so let me just say one thing. So the team will have more time obviously to respond to what they've seen from the impact of Brexit. Maybe I'm working seriously ever since the June 23 to react to this cost mix, every single part of the business. So, there'll be more time to sort of reposition and reset the business in terms of this new environment. I think the big question mark for the industry is what happens when the negotiations are concluded, particularly around duty rates, and that's a complete TBD and that will be sometime apparently in 2019. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Let me also \u2013 I know you're asking a question about Brexit, but it's \u2013 let me give some perspective on Europe, because as Bob mentioned if you look year-to-date, we've made over $1 billion. And the growth rates \u2013 the industry across Europe was up about 4% in the quarter, so we're seeing that steady growth. Importantly as we said we're seeing a strong growth in the commercial vehicle market, now in the UK but across the continent which plays well for us given transit. We're seeing SUVs as the percentage of the industry, it's up another 2 points or 3 points across the industry. And as you know we've had a strategy to reposition the Ford brand in Europe in terms of moving it up a bit. And as you saw from the results and Bob mentioned, the mix improvements have not only come from the products, the product line mix like Mondeo and Mustang and Ranger, but it's also come by a very deliberate strategy on series mix. And to give you just a couple of data points where we have a very high series mix on our transit of Ranger over 50% of the mix on Ranger is the Wildtrak version, which is the high-end version. And on Edge, over 50% of the mix is on the sport version. So, nearly 50% of our Edge is been sold for \u20ac50,000 or more. So, we're going to continue that strategy across Europe and also in the UK. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, let me just add one other thing. Remember, Emmanuel in my comments I talked about Russia. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : Yeah. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Russia is having a very nice positive year-over-year effect in Russia or in Europe. So, you can imagine throughout 2017, 2018, 2019 as that economy continues to improve as oil prices stabilize or even continue to improve further, that's going to have a nice effect on our business. We stayed, because we saw that opportunity, we're seeing it come home even this year, that is another factor, I think you don't want to forget our business in Europe. Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC : That's great color. Thank you. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, everybody. I got a couple of questions. First, on the topic of vehicle safety, I'm sure you guys have seen the FHA data from the first half of this year, unfortunately with traffic fatalities up by 10.5%, on a comp it was up the better part of 10% the prior year. And you're in an interesting position to be able to commercialize these relatively affordable technologies that really address that, and I'm sure it's in everybody's interest that you do that, and we know you're aware and it's in your interest and you want to do it. I guess the question for you is, how much on a per-unit basis, as you talk to Raj's team and your suppliers, how much would it take, putting aside the fully-autonomous robo stuff. To make a real dent in vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-pedestrian safety, like per car, are we talking to make accidents like a third less likely for your new vehicles? Is it hundreds of dollars a car, it is a $1,000 or is it several thousand? Just high-level, Mark, would really appreciate it given all your exposure to this technological discussion? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, high level, yeah, it's some degree of money; I can't give you a figure, whether it's $300, $3,000, et cetera. If you look at the way the safety features, the driver-assisted features that we have on our vehicles today, we literally offer them across \u2013 either standard or options across our vehicle lineup. And if you look at the pricing, we're very competitive along those lines. To your question around the fatalities, that's why we're so bullish on autonomous vehicles, and as you know the societal and safety benefits that can have from that, but let's face it, I haven't seen the data yet. But if you really want to improve vehicle safety, you take peoples' phones away from them, so they can't text while they're driving, because I have a feeling that a lot of the increase on that has to do with that. Now, we \u2013 our approach on that is through our SYNC system, allow people to do it, rather than touching their phones, keeping their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel, and that's our approach. But, it's an interesting question, but one in which I can't give you an exact answer. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Well maybe just as a follow-up; before this stuff gets regulated and is standard equipment, you do have big players out there like Toyota talking about making AEB, for example, standard across their global lineup by as soon as 2018, 2019. If a big competitor like that does something, I mean is it safe to assume that Ford can't be far behind, just from a marketing and consumer advocacy and safety standpoint? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: When you look \u2013 it's a good question. When you look at our brand, one of things we're known for is safety... Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yeah. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: ...and you can expect that we will continue to build and defend that. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Last question, then. As you make a big push towards electric vehicles, you've been very clear in your capital markets day and your communication on how you are putting potentially billions and billions in that effort of electrification. Does that open up an opportunity for you to bring in an entirely new consumer electronics supply base, players like the LG and Samsung and Panasonic, et cetera, that maybe traditionally were maybe only peripheral automotive suppliers and now could be something a lot more substantial? And for you to bring them in and kind of add a little competitive fire to your traditional Tier 1 mechanical suppliers to kind of \u2013 as a negotiating tactic and to play one off versus the other. Not that it's \u2013 just in \u2013 for the sake of improving the product and getting a lower purchase bill of materials. Is that an opportunity? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, yeah. We're always looking for new suppliers and when you speak of some of the technologies around electrification, we are using a number of new suppliers. The key thing, as you know, Adam, is coming into the auto industry, the duty cycles, the automotive safety grade of those parts and components is absolutely essential. And sometimes, we find when we bring some new suppliers in, they're kind of surprised at that. But our job is to educate them on that, and I think, you'll continue to see us do that, and look across the landscape for the best supplier that give us the best technology, world-class technology at the best cost. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Mark. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Adam. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to really delve into the Super Duty a little bit more. Are you learning anything different than your expectations about the cost to produce or the line speed, et cetera, that would make you feel any different about its profit contribution in 2017 versus 2016? I think that the Super Duty is being fully redesigned for the first time in years, so it may be costly to produce. That was part of the thought process that that would offset some of the pricing mix benefits of the new version in 2017. So I'm asking because I remember that the F-150 launch, it went better than expected, right, with cost to produce being a little bit less and that was one of the drivers of upside in 2015. So just curious if maybe you are seeing anything similar as you get more experience producing the product. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I think overall, Ryan, first off from a demand standpoint, we're seeing, as I mentioned earlier, a really good response to the product. In terms of the launch in the plant, as you know, the plant, we took the learnings from the launches that we had in Dearborn and Kansas City on the F-150. The launch came up very fast, it came up very well; the quality is good coming out of the plant. We \u2013 the suppliers are performing well, we do have an issue on one supplier that's trying to keep up with us on demand and we're working with them on that. But as our usual process, we'll launch, settle the plant down, and that's where the teams \u2013 once we get to the launch levels and the plant is stable, that's when we really start going to town on looking at are there ways of getting more efficient in terms of the productivity on the line, but also material costs. In terms of 2017, we're going to continue to follow that pattern in terms of impacts, as Bob has mentioned, when you look at the margins on the new Super Duty, they are lower than the previous one, and that's because it's the first time we've redone the product in 18 years. But we'll continue to follow the process and continue to work on the cost and the margins over time. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then just the last question is on Middle East and Africa. The loss there was a lot bigger than we've seen historically. And I know, Bob, I heard you say to not take that as a run rate, but also maybe to expect some losses there going forward. So the question is really was there anything unusual weighing on the region in the quarter? And then if the losses are to continue for some time, do you maybe need to reevaluate your participation in some of the many markets in that region, sort of similar to what you did with Japan and Indonesia earlier? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well. First thing I guess I would say, yeah, I think there was something unusual and that's what I was trying to highlight in my comments, which is around the performance of the business in Middle East and specifically in Saudi. And that was a combination of what's happening in the external environment, but also our own, if you will, business performance, which we're working hard to address. I think we'll get that back on track just like we did in China. When I look at the fourth quarter and quarter-to-quarter, I just think we're going to see on a quarterly basis, improvements across most parts of the business. It's just the thing you've just got to keep in mind, Ryan, I think this is a different conversation than in Japan or Indonesia \u2013 is the external environment is sort of similar to Russia and South America, is this is an environment that's been affected by the commodity cycle, it's been very affected by oil, particularly in the Middle East. It's been affected to some extent by geopolitical issues. So, I think it's a different conversation and discussion. I think we'll end up with much better results in the fourth quarter based on what we see today, and going forward I do think the team's got a really, really good growth plan that will get us to profitability and very, very good returns over the business planning period. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for the color. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. The first one just on Europe. As you think about the Brexit headwinds that you've outlined and then some of the positives from Russia, I'm just curious to hear your thoughts if the positives from Russia can actually outweigh some of the negative effects that you're expecting from the Brexit situation. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: We always assumed that we'd see improvement in Russia; I just didn't want you guys to forget about it, because we're still there, and we're seeing that benefit. It's a tool in our toolkit that maybe some others don't have in terms of where the business will go in the future, but that was the case before Brexit. Brexit is a new thing and we're going to have to respond to that. The team is doing that by looking at every single part of the business. I do think we've got that added benefit of an improving Russia business to help us. But, clearly, the business excluding Russia, we have a lot of work to do to sort of rethink how we get to those 6% to 8% returns that we're targeting, but Jim Farley and his team are all over it. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: And just remember, David, the guidance that we gave at Investor Day, that the 2017, we expect Europe to continue to be profitable but at a lower level than we see in 2017 -2016. And that's specifically taking into account the impact that we're presently projecting for Brexit. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. And then just on the back of that, when we think about moving from growth in Western Europe to growth in Eastern Europe, what impacts does that have on your mix specifically? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: I'm not sure I understand the question. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, when you think about the vehicles that you are selling, right, in terms of the UK you called out you've been doing well in the commercial vehicle market in the Transit vans. Smaller cars, SUVs; as you move from Western Europe into Eastern Europe, are we talking about larger vehicles that could potentially be helpful? Are you looking at smaller vehicles with less content? I'm just trying to think about the mix of vehicles as we move from Western Europe to Eastern European growth. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, one thing I would highlight and Mark touched on it, we are now providing the KA+, which is coming from India, replacing the vehicle that was actually built by Fiat for us in Poland. So, we've got the opportunity to \u2013 particularly given the reaction that we're starting to see to that product, I think, we've got the opportunity to get a lot more out of that part of the business, plus we've been working very, very hard on our small vehicle business in Russia across Ford entirely, but certainly \u2013 not Russia, in Europe. And I think the actions that will be coming to market in the future are going to give us an opportunity to see more contributions in smaller vehicles, that's certainly part of the equation that Jim and the team are working on. That will help as well. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. And then my second question, maybe it's more appropriate for your 11 o'clock call. But when we think about leasing characteristics, what levels of subvention are you at today? Where is that from a year ago and where do you expect that to go going forward? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, we don't provide that level of specificity. I would just say that the costs of subvention are rising and they're high because of what's happening with residual values. And so that's certainly something that we have to take into consideration because we can take those funds and we can deploy them in other ways that might be more effective in the marketplace and that's certainly one of the balancing actions that our marketing sales team considers as they're thinking about how to go to market. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thank you for the time. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, David. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thanks. Good morning. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Good morning. David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Bob, can I get a clarification on the pension here? Are we saying at a global basis by the end of next year you'll be fully funded? Is that correct? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, by the end of next year, we expect our global pension plans to be \u2013 it's not fully funded, it's largely funded and by that you might think about 95% funded. So, it really depends on what's going to happen with the interest rates and the asset returns, but the U.S. is already getting close to that. I think we're a little bit behind that level in the UK and Germany. But our funded plans by the time we get to the end of next year should be, if not fully funded than largely funded. David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. And just one follow-up on autonomous; if tech and the regulatory environment move faster than you guys expected, would you guys be willing to offer level 5 perhaps sooner than you were thinking or does it depend on the scenario testing that Raj talked about? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, it's really dictated by our technical development, not dictated by regulations. And as we said, we've been working at this for over 10 years and we feel confident in our plans and how we're approaching this. And level 4 is, we think is on track for 2021 and again, it's in defined areas that we can 3D-map in using LIDARs and sensors. Level 5 is a different kettle of fish in terms of the amount of technology on the hardware and the software algorithms to be able to handle all those climatic conditions. And so, well, that's our approach and we're confident in that approach. David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Thank you. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you. Operator : There are currently no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to the presenters for any closing remarks. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: All right. Thank you very much. See you soon everybody. Operator : Again, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter and full year 2016 Ford earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ted Cannis, Executive Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ted Cannis : Great thanks very much Crystal, good morning, and welcome everybody to Ford Motor Company's fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings review. Presenting today is Mark Fields, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer; and also participating are John Lawler, Vice President & Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President and Corporate Treasurer and CFO Ford Smart Mobility; and Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and also Marion Harris, Ford Credit CFO. Copies of the press release and presentations slides are on our Web site as usual. The preliminary results discussed today includes some non-GAAP references and these are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix. It also includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance, actual results may vary and the significant factors are included in the presentation. Just as a reminder, Ford Credit will be holding a call to 11 AM to review its fourth quarter and full year results. With that, Mark? Mark Fields : Okay. Thanks, Ted, and Good morning, everybody. At our Investor Day in September and again at the Deutsche Bank Conference two weeks ago, we said we were confident that would achieve our second best full year company adjusted pretax profit and we have. 2016 was a very strong year and in addition to our second best full year company profit of $10.4 billion, we had a new record operating margin of 6.7% and our second strongest cash flow of $6.4 billion. The fourth quarter was also strong with company pretax profit of 2.1 billion. So in total we delivered our seventh year in a row of strong results with 2016 only exceeded by our record performance in 2015. And of course, we will dig into the details in a minute, but first I'd like to turn to how we're creating value in our business. So, turning on Slide 4, we're continuing to focus on the four drivers of shareholder value, growth, risk, returns, and rewards. So, looking at growth, we launched several key vehicles this year helping to strengthen our core business including the all new Super Duty which further solidified our long-time U.S. leadership in full size pickup trucks. We also took a step forward in the transformation of Lincoln with the launch of the Continental and strong sales growth globally including nearly tripling our sales in China. In terms of risk we had strong performance in North America and combined profit for our operations outside of North America. And thanks to our de-risking strategy our global funded pension plans held up well, and as a result our globally funded pension plans now are nearly fully funded and our improved risk profile was recognized with the ratings upgrade from each of the four major rating agencies. Now in terms of returns, a number of key metrics set records or near records, including a record profit in Europe of $1.2 billion and our second-best profit in Asia-Pacific. And our disciplined and focused approach to capital allocation continues to pay off as we continue generating a healthy return on invested capital that's well in excess of our cost to capital. And then finally in terms of rewards, shareholders benefited from our continued success and our strong cash generation as we distributed $3.5 billion including our first supplemental dividend that totaled $1 billion. Now Slide 5 shows some of the additional highlights in the full year and these include a couple of things. First, the Ford brand was the best-selling brand in the U.S. for the seventh year in a row, F-Series marked its 40th year as the top selling truck in the U.S. and 35 years of the best-selling vehicle. Our Transit is doing extremely well as the best-selling cargo van in the world and helping us to be the best-selling commercial vehicle brand in Europe for the second consecutive year. And when it comes to our emerging opportunities we have expanded Chariot to two cities, San Francisco and Austin, Texas and we have plans to expand to eight cities by the end of this year including one outside of the United States. We had the most U.S. patents of any automaker during 2016 and I think this is a very good indicator in terms of how we're amping up our innovation efforts inside the Company. And we made progress towards our intent to have a high volume fully autonomous level four vehicle in ride sharing or the ride handling services starting in 2021 with this month's introduction of our next generation fusion hybrid autonomous development vehicle. So, now let me turn it over to Bob and he'll take us through the details of our business performance. Bob Shanks : Okay, thanks Mark. And let's start on Slide 7 with the key financial summary, and I'll just go down our fourth quarter and full year and cover some of the key metrics. So let's start in the first column with the top line wholesales and revenue. You can see that we were down just a bit, it was 4% in both wholesales and revenue and that was more than explained by a favorable stock adjustment in North America. Going down further, you can see our company adjusted pretax results in the quarter came in at $2.1 billion which was down $478 million and you can see above that that each of the segments that we report automotive, financial services and all other which is primarily our treasury operations, our net interest expense, you can see that they were all down. Going further down let's look at special items on the pretax basis, $3.2 billion, and that was driven primarily by the announcement that we made on January 20th, of losses associated with the re-measurement of our global pension and OPEB plans and that was driven by lower discount rates and just to remind you that\u2019s non-cash. We also picked up a charge of $200 million associated with our decision to cancel our new plant in Mexico, that was primarily for our cost associated with returning the site to its natural state and also compensating the state government for the cost that it incurred in terms of putting infrastructure on the site. We also picked up a little bit of charges associated with the announcement that we made earlier in the year around our withdrawal from the Japanese and Indonesian markets. If you go down further you can see the net income or loss attributable to Ford in the quarter driven by the specials, was a negative 783, and then further down our adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.30 which was in line with First Call and Bloomberg. You can see the liquidity matrix, we'll go through those later, but all of them very, very strong. Let's go down the same call -- the same matrix that we were on the full year column. So we'll start with wholesale and revenue, pretty flat, just up a touch. Going down further to our company adjusted pretax results, marks $10.4 billion which was the second best that we've ever had.  Special items on a pretax basis, the $3.2 billion in addition to that came in at $3.6 billion, that\u2019s related to separations that we had earlier in the year both in North America and Europe. On a net income basis we came at $4.6 billion, that was down, that was driven by the special items and adjusted earnings per share with $1.76. Let's now go through the balance of the presentation, the first three Slides are going to be on the full year, those are the only Slides we're going to talk to, they're full year, we have in the appendix incremental Slides that show the bridge between last year and this year's profits for the business units. We are not going to go through them, but if you have question, when we get to the Q&A session, obviously, Mark and I would be happy to answer them. So looking on Slide 8, looking at absolutes. You can see to the far left the $10.4 billion, at the top automotive which was also the second-best result at $9.4 billion, within that you can see the very strong results in North America at $9 billion, South America a loss, Europe a record result of $1.2 billion, we ended up at negative $300 for Middle East and Africa and the second-best result that we've seen in Asia Pacific at $627. We had solid results in financial services driven by Ford Credit of $1.8 million. All other is primarily interest expense and share market value adjustments to our investment portfolio. Right, and the other thing I just wanted to mention to this Slide, is that if you were to take the operations outside of North America on a combined basis, we generated a profit of $421 million, that was nearly double of what we did last year and it was the best result on a combined basis for that part of our business in 5 years. Okay let's turn now to Slide 9, we're going to drill down now from total company to automotive, this is again full year. So, the first thing we see when we set back and look at this slide is how similar it was to last year. So it just shows how close we were to meeting is not achieving, another record. So it was a really strong result, right across the board. When you go across as you look at the market share, the market share came in 10th lower and that was driven by declines in North America and South America. The operating margin we touched on and the pretax results we've touched on and we'll go into detail in the next slide in terms of the change. Let's move to Slide 10. Mark Fields : But Bob, before you go on, let me just comment. It's really worth noting that our -- sorry, why don\u2019t you go on, it's really in the next slide. Bob Shanks : Yes, you want to talk about the next slide. So if I turn to Slide 10. And what Mark is talking about, if you look at the slide you can see we were down a 146 million. The thing that really drove this was higher warranty costs. There is a lot of ups and downs, but the reason we call up warranty costs, is because obviously they're not something that was expected. If you look at the callout box for contribution costs you can see a negative 880, that was driven by recalls and the largest one that we've had in many-many years really drove that, that was the door latch recall that we had in the third quarter, it was nearly $600 million. I've got a couple other things to highlight, if you look at the callout box for volume and mix, we had a very strong headwind during the year from stocks, that's adverse stock changes, so we had stock build last year, stock reductions this year and that was basically in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. But if you go just below that and this what Mark may have wanted to talk about, we had very, very strong performance on mix. Which has been a deliberate strategy of ours. It's both positive mix performance in terms of the types of products that we sell. It was also positive performance in terms of higher series derivatives that we sell, and that was across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The last thing I would just want to mention is, if you go to the far right, you can see some good news there, that is the non-repeat of the ratification bonus that were paid a year ago to the UAW following the conclusion of our UAW contract. Mark Fields : And just picking up Bob's comments around mix, I think it's really worth pointing out that the mix performance that we achieved last year which is really impressive compared with the prior year and it really resulted in a year-over-year profit improvement for the automotive segment of just about $2.4 billion and that's been mainly in North America, in Europe, and Asia-Pacific. As Bob was starting to mention, this really reflects a very deliberate and successful strategy to strengthen our brands and enrich to mix of our vehicles, by essentially focusing on the higher margin segments where consumer interest is particularly strong and we've also achieved greater sales of higher series derivatives like Titanium, ST, RS, and Raptor within our individual vehicle lines and I can assure you that this will continue to be an area focused for us and an opportunity for us as we go forward. Bob Shanks : Okay, thanks Mark. And now we're going to flip to our quarterly slide. So, from this point forward the color and texture that I'll provided will be primarily on the fourth quarter again. In the Q&A if you have questions on full year please go ahead and ask. So, this is looking at absolute for the quarter, so you can see the $2.1 billion pretax results to the far left that reflected a 2 billion automotive profit, within that a 2 billion profit coming from North America. Profits in Europe and in Asia-Pacific, declines into South America, Middle East and Africa, solid result in financial services and again in all other that's primarily net interest expense. Let's move to Slide 12, and here we'll look at the key metrics for the automotive segment in the quarter. So, stepping back and looking at it, you can see that wholesales and revenue were down, that was driven primarily by unfavorable stock adjustments, again in North America. If you look at -- we'll it's not on the slide, but if you look at the far right, in terms of the global SAR, it actually came in 2% higher than a year ago and that was driven by gains in Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America. Looking at market share we were down at 10th, as I mentioned earlier that is North America, but actually that was full year. So this is the quarter, North America and Europe, upgrading the margin to 5.7% and then the result on the pretax basis which was down. And if we go to the next slide, Slide 13, and we'll go through what drove that decline of $280 million. It was basically driven by unfavorable stock changes as well as higher costs, so if you look at the callout box on volume and mix, you can see the $1 billion adverse change related to stock changes that was 125,000 units, most of that was in North America, and again related to the stock builds we had a year ago. A lot of that around F-series, but also products that we're going to be launching in 2016 and this year we've had a stock depletion in the quarter, making sure that our production remains in line with our demand. As you look at the far right, you can see again the impact of the ratification bonus. Okay let's turn now to the business units and we'll start as always with North America in the fourth quarter. Looking at the far left, wholesales down 105,000; 98,000 of that was the unfavorable stock change that I referenced earlier. Revenue down 7%, that again was driven by that volume change. The SAAR in the region was 22.5 million units, that were up 400,000 that was actually driven Mexico 300,000 units. We did see an improvement in the U.S. That was up 100,000 to 1.4 million SAAR. Our market share was down 0.3 of a point, that was driven by unfavorable fleet performance and that was driven by our rental, as you remember, we had pulled ahead of our rental sales in the first part of the year. So this is, if you will, the payback in terms of share effect in the fourth quarter. It was partially offset by stronger performance on a regional basis and that was driven by F-series. Operating margin was a record for the quarter at 8.5% and then the $2 billion pretax result to the far right. If you go below the page, I will note the $9 billion profit in North America, very strong, it was just down a touch from the 9.3 last year and the operating margin very, very strong, once again at 9.7%. If we were to exclude the door latch recall, we would have come in at 10.3%. So to give you a sense of the underlying run rate at the business, very consistent with the performance of 2015. Alright, let's go to the next Slide. And this is the explanation of the change in North America's result on a year-over-year basis down $73 million, you can see that was driven primarily by stock changes and also by higher product cost. If you look at the callout box for contribution cost, you can see materials excluding commodities that as more then explained by higher product cost related to the products that we launched including Super Duty and earlier in the year the Fusion, the Escape, and also the Continental in the later part of the year. Into the far right of course is the ratification bonus. For 2017, in terms of guidance we're continuing to expect that North America's operating margin and its profit is going to be strong, but as we've said previously it will be lower than 2016 and this is mainly due to unfavorable volume and mix and also to the increased investments that we're making in the areas of emerging opportunities. Mark Fields : I'll make a comment around F-series. Obviously, we get a lot of questions on F-series. But as you all recall two years ago, we added strength and capability to the F-150, increasing the payload, the towing, the torque, while taking our weight with the addition of the high strength aluminum alloy body. And this past year we repeated that success with the first all new Super Duty that we've had in 18 years. Some people call these innovations a risk, but I think with the response that we see from customers, they are clear successes in the market place. We'll look at just a couple of approve points for that. Our F-series total sales last year were over 820,000 units and that\u2019s the first-time sales have topped 800,000 units in a decade. And if you look at the fourth quarter, our sales were up 4% with retail up 9%. And for the full year we gained almost one full point of market share in the segment. If you all just look at the fourth quarter, our average transaction price was up over $1,300 versus last year and that's significantly outpacing the segment. And then finally we outsold our nearest truck competitor by 246,000 units and essentially increasing our lead by about 36% year-on-year. So we are really pleased with the market's perception to our F-series and we plan to build on that moment going forward. Bob Shanks : Okay, let's turn south now on Slide 16 and we'll look at to South America, so the first thing you would note looking at the slide which is encouraging, is that, all the metric are up even though on a pretax result basis you can see, only a change of $2 million, but nonetheless it is the first time since the third quarter of 2013 that we're have seen metric turning in a positive direction, which is enforcing our view that the cyclical downturn that we've seen for the last several years is probably bottoming out, coming to an end, and our expectations for next year is that the loss well improve as we see the economic cycle start to turn. If you look at the quarter, the improvement in wholesales was basically around stocks, that also drove the improvement in revenue along with some pricing. And in terms of the SAAR, the SAAR was still down for the region, 200,000 units to 3.8 million units, and within that Brazil was down even more 400,000. But it was the slowest decline on a quarterly basis that we've seen throughout the year. We've seen that decline kind of improve on our quarter-to-quarter basis as we've gone throughout the year. So again, another sign of things starting to turn. Within that environment, the market share was better, that was due to strong sales of Ka and Ranger, and that was in Brazil and in all other markets other than in Argentina. And again, the full year came in at $1.1 billion decline that was down about a third from where we were a year earlier and again driven by the economic environment that we were operating in. And to underscore that if you go to the next slide, on Slide 17, this is the apparent that we've shared with you through much of the past number of quarters. You can see a lot of ups and downs for a change of only $2 million, but if you look at the second column there you can see that while we're continuing to price and price quite aggressively, it is not enough to offset the effect of the high local inflation and the adverse exchange in this case both Argentina and Brazil. And as I mentioned earlier, we do expect in 2017 our loss to improve for South America as the economic cycle begins to turn. All right, let's move to a very successful story on Slide 18, Europe. This is our seventh consecutive quarterly profit. You can see that the wholesales were actually flat in the quarter, revenue also essentially flat, that decline is more than explained by exchange. In terms of SAAR, it came in at 20.7 million units which was up 1.2 million units, so a strong industry results. Within that our share was down and touch 0.2 of a point and that was explained by lower passenger car sales that was basically Mondeo, Focus and C-Max, but also within that and Mark touched on it earlier, we had very strong performance for commercial vehicles, our share was over 14%, it was up 0.4 of a point and not only were we the number one brand in the year, we were the number one brand also in the fourth quarter. Operating margin at 2.3% and $166 million profit and if you go down and look at the full year, that was a record at $1.2 billion, it was also a record margin at 4.2%. Then let's look at the change on a year-over-year basis, again lots of ups and downs, up $35 million and it was driven primarily by continuous favorable cost performance. To the point that Mark made earlier around mix, if you look at the callout box on mix, that $39 million within that is about $100 million of good news on mix, both mix among product as well as series mix and options. Once, the last point I wanted to make on this slide is, as I've said throughout the year, the business has been benefitted from continued improvement in the results in Russia, that was also the case in the fourth quarter. So, for 2017 we do expect Europe to remain profitable, but it will probably be lower than in 2017 and that's driven by the effect of Brexit on the sterling along with higher costs that we expect associated with the launch of the Fiesta and the Eco Sport along with continued investment that we plan to make in the business moving forward. Mark Fields : And just overall in the business in Europe, as you know we made tough choices and strategic decisions including restructuring in Russia when others retreated and they're paying off as you heard from record profit and operating margin in the region, and as Bob mentioned it's been driven by an aggressive focus on cost, with nearly $400 million in cost improvement in 2016 alone, but we've also had an equally strong focus on our product strategy or the revenue side of it adding a lot of new vehicles and derivatives and segments with the highest growth and profit potential. So, an example of that is we saw a profit improvement of over 400 million in 2016 from a more favorable mix of progress, of products compared to 2015 driven by products like the Edge, but in addition to that more than half of our passenger car sales in 2016 were high series vehicles, the Titanium's, the Vignale's, the ST, the RS, and this helped push the series mix up more than $300 million compared with last year. So, bottom line is, we've taken the tough actions, we've invested in the product and the brand and we're seeing the results in the bottom line. Bob Shanks : I didn't mention it, Mark, but as we do see the cycle change not only in South America, but in '17 Russia also is expected to improve and contribute to a better result at least in that part of Europe in 2017 compared to '16. Let's move to another market that's actually been very much affected by commodities, oil, geopolitical conditions, this is the Middle East and Africa. So basically, for the quarter, and you can see the metrics here on Slide 20, as well as for the full year which is shown below, it's essentially the same capture. It's all of what I just mentioned and when look at the SAAR in the quarter, it came in down 22%, is the worst decline on a quarterly basis throughout the year that we've seen and it really is driven by everything that I just mentioned. Within that environment we were able to generate higher share both in the quarter and in the full year and that was due to stronger sales of Rangers, Fiesta and Focus in Africa, but whether you're looking at the quarter or whether you're looking at the full year, basically you're seeing the impact of lower industry volume and you're also seeing the effect of adverse exchange primarily the South African rand, and remember we've got manufacturing operations in South Africa and that's why that's an important currency for us there. As we look at 2017 a very similar story to what I said about Russia, to what I said about Brazil, we are starting to see the commodity cycle change and so as a result we do expect to see Middle East and Africa improve compared with the results that we're showing here for the full year and that's based not only on favorable external conditions, but lower costs and higher net pricing. All right, let's move to Asia-Pacific on Slide 21. A strong story here both for the quarter and for the year. You can see the wholesale is up and revenue flat, remember revenue does not include the China JVs. In terms of the wholesale improvement that's driven both by stronger industry as well as share improvement. In terms of SAAR 44.4 million, SAAR for the quarter, that was up 5% from a year ago and that was driven by very strong performance in China. In terms of market share we were up 0.3 of a point, again that's China, that's very strong sales of Escort, and then the Taurus, the Edge and the Lincoln all contributing towards the favorable mix that Mark talked about for Asia Pacific. In terms of margin, strong, but down at 8.4%, pretax results strong, but also lower. Just look at the far right there as usual just a comment on the China JVs, they came in at $380 million, that\u2019s our equity after tax. Our share of the profit there and the margin at what is 12.8%. So it was down, but still double digits, we're still getting a very good overall margin coming out of our JVs in China.  If you go down to the very bottom, you can see the strong results, the second best at $627 million, that was down and whether you're looking at the quarter or you're looking at the full year was driven by lower pricing in China on an industry basis as well as adverse exchange and that was the renminbi. And if you go to the next Slide on Slide 22, you can see exactly what I just mentioned, you can see the impact in that pricing and the impact on exchange, cost about flat and some favorable volume and mix, including last year in the quarter we didn\u2019t actually have favorable mix, on a year-over-year basis we have launched last year in the quarter Edge and Taurus and so the accounts are a little bit different than the other part of the year. In terms of '17, we do expect Asia-Pacific's profit to improve. We don\u2019t expect that come from China, we think the China JV profits will be relatively flat, margin will still be double-digit, but probably down a bit, again because of continued negative pricing, although moderating from what we saw this year, an unfavorable exchange. What we're going to see is improved results across the rest of Asia Pacific, which we also saw in 2016, but at a pace that\u2019s even greater. Mark Fields : And just to add a little bit of color on China, you look at sales in 2016, it was our best sales year ever in China. We sold about 1.27 million vehicles and that\u2019s up 14% over 2015. And importantly, this was driven not only by Lincoln, which is as Bob pointed our earlier, but also our now five vehicle SUV line up, that really has been a key driver for our sales growth including Edge and Explorer, but also at the same time by our performance vehicles, we've introduced Mustang, Focus RS, Focus ST, and as Bob mentioned we had strong sales of the Taurus in China, after we launched it. So I think our efforts and we've talked to you about this in the past, to fill out our product line up over the past few years, has really started to pay off in terms of growth in what is the world's largest vehicle market. Bob Shanks : And we have talked a lot about, focusing on the rest of Asia-Pacific, that improved results that we saw in '16 in the quarter, and then what we're expecting in 2017 is really encouraging as well, better balance of profitability across the region. All right, let's turn to Ford Credit rate now, we've got three Slides here as usual. So if you look at the far left it grew and you can see that in the first two sets of data. Our pretax results were down and I'll show you what was behind that, it was down both for the quarter and for the full year coming in still strong at $1.9 billion for the full year. And in terms of our U.S. retail and lease matrix, the portfolio performance continues to be robust, all of our origination servicing and collection practices continue to be consistent. So we are seeing delinquencies start to increase or if they've been increasing, then approaching historical levels but not there. And the same is true for loss receivables. Although there we are starting to get closer to the historical performance of the past. Let's go the next Slide and look at year-over-year. There are a few things to comment here, we're down a $158 million, if you first go the far right, we had a pension settlement that occurred between Ford Credit and Ford of Europe. There is actually positive offset to this to the dollar in the European results and this is basically just simply, we have a Ford plan. In the past, we've kind of split, if you will, the expense and all the results of that plan between Ford credit and Europe, we've done that in other regions as well. So what we have done is we've chosen to have Ford Credit settle its share of deficit at this point in time. It will continue to report ongoing service cost, but we're going to put all of the balance now of the risk and rewards on their portfolio to Automotive who will manage it going forward. And we've already done that in other parts of the business over the last number of years. And then if you look at the middle factor around lease residuals, you can see there the same thing that we've seen all quarters of this year, the impact at lower auction value on the business. And if you go to the next slide, Slide 25, at the upper left, let's focus on the 36 months line which is the one that\u2019s below, you can see that we had pretty stable performance actually up from the fourth quarter and the first, second and third quarters, we had a 6% decline, about $1,060 in the fourth quarter, that was largely in September and October, knock on wood in November, December and so far, we've actually seeing a much more stable performance in auction values. Although we are projecting auction values to be down in 2017 and that\u2019s contained in our guidance. But it was encouraging to see it start to stabilize at least over that period of time. And then on the upper right, I just want to highlight, you can see that the industry continued to perform or to lease at a pretty healthy rate if you will. We actually have had a strategy to take down our lease penetration as Ford Credit, this is in respond to higher incentive which is making leasing very expensive as well as lower auction values and recognition of all the units coming back to markets. So you can see that we're starting to separate a bit from the overall industry and in fact on a full year basis, which you don\u2019t see here, we leased it 22% which is actually unchanged from 2015, the industry was at 30%, that was actually up 2 points from 2015. And if you look at the metrics at the bottom you can see, pretty consistent from where we've been in the past, whether it's a resale contract placement terms or FICO and higher risk in mix. For the full year, no change to our guidance, we expect Ford Credit results to be lower probably about $1.5 billion and again it's around our expectation for lower residual values. If we go to the next slide, this is cash flow. So in terms of our cash flow performance, very strong, you can see operating came in it 1.5 in the quarter, 6.4 for the full year, that was driven by Automotive segment pretax results. Just want to highlight, our capital spending came in a 6.9 billion in the year that compares with 7.1 last year, we're guiding to $7 billion in 2017. So pretty flat over that three-year period. If you go down further and look at changes in debt, you can see it's positive, that\u2019s the $2.8 million debt issuance that we had early in December of last year. And then you can see pension contributions at $1.2 billion, it's consistent with what we had guided to. We are expecting in '17 pension contributions to be about $1 billion and we're also expecting about $1 billion in '18 and '19, that\u2019s up from the 500 million to 700 million that we've previously guided, and that\u2019s simply a reflection of the higher discount rates. And then dividend, share repurchases $3.5 billion which includes the $1 billion supplemental dividend that we announced and paid in the first quarter of 2016. Okay, let\u2019s go to the annual update on pension, a few things to call out here. You can see that the underfunded status actually didn\u2019t move much given the very sharp decline that we saw in discount rates which is just below there in the second section of data. The U.S. in fact, hardly moved it all which is really -- just shows the success of the de-risking strategy that we've had in place for the last six, seven years. We saw a bigger movement in the non-U.S. plants and if you look below there you can see that's because the discount rates were actually three times lower than what the declines were in the U.S. We have very strong asset performance, we've talked about pension plan contributions, we had positive pension plan expense in 2016, we expect to have positive expense in 2017. And then of course the re-measurement losses that were announced on the 20th. Now let's go to my last slide, on Slide 28. So here is the balance sheet summary, so in sum, cash liquidity balance is very strong, Ford Credit's balance sheet is very strong with good liquidity and we've talked about the pensions. The only thing I want to comment on incrementally here is around the cash balance, at $27.5 billion, obviously above our target of $20 billion. And just to share with you how we're thinking about that, 2.8 of that obviously is the debt that we took on in December. And to remind you we took on that debt because we believed it was opportunistic to do so, the market was very favorable, we know that interest rates are going to be going up, so it was a great time to go in and get that debt. Our balance sheet was so strong that we were able to take it on and still not affect our leverage metrics that we're working towards and again as we look ahead at what we want to do in terms of transforming the business, a core as well as the emerging opportunities where we want to grow that we wanted to take advantage of favorable market conditions and make sure that we have that cash available for those uses. We will be very, very prudent, disciplined in terms of how we use that, but we thought it was great to take advantage of the market and get that cash when it was available. The other thing that I guess I would mention to you is, while there is a lot of enthusiasm that we're all very optimistic about what may come out of the new administration in terms of growth policies, is also more uncertainty, there is more volatility potentially around that. And also, we're probably closer towards the end of the cycle whenever that might be than we're to the beginning. So, we're not uncomfortable with having a little bit of extra cash at this point in time. So, with that let me turn it back to Mark and he'll take us through the balance of the presentation. Mark Fields : Okay, thanks, Bob. So, Slide 29 shows our view of GDP growth rates and industry volumes, and all in all we expect growth in GDP globally in all of the major markets that are showing on the slide there. Similarly, we expect growth in the industry volume and in the volume for all major markets except the U.S. which is going to remain strong. If you move to Slide 30, that just shows that we delivered strong results in 2016 again in line with our expectations. And then looking ahead, 2017 is going to be a good year for Ford. We expect our key financial metrics for the company as I said in 2017 to be good, yet lower or about the same as 2016. At a company level this is driven mainly by investments that we're making in the areas of emerging opportunities and it's the same guidance that we reiterated at the Deutsche Bank conference two weeks ago. Now turning to our business units, on Slide 32, to give you a little flavor for kind of what's going on in the business units. We do expect profits in North America and Europe to be lower than last year, while we expect to see improvements in results in South America, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific. And for reasons that were already mentioned by Bob, results in Ford Credit and all other will be lower in 2016. In addition, you can see in the slide the various kind of puts and takes for each region, so you get an understanding of kind of what's going on one level down in each region in terms of the factors driving the business. So, let me just wrap this all up before we go to the Q&A, we delivered a very strong 2016, in fact as we mentioned our second best adjusted full year pretax profit. We also delivered a full year operating margin in North America of 9.7%, which is at the high end of our 8% to 10% target range, which we've talked about in the past. We set a number of records for the year including a record adjusted pretax profit in Europe and record sales in China and we expect to deliver another good year this year, again in line with the expectations that we set initially at our Investor Day, last September. So we're making substantial progress on expanding our business and that\u2019s really going from a strong, healthy Automotive company to one that will be even stronger and bigger as we expand to an auto and mobility company in the future.  Which brings me to Slide 34, and importantly we now have a very clear vision and strategy for our business going forward. And our plan is simple, we want to achieve top quartile returns by expanding our scope from vehicles to mobility, through business model innovation. I can tell you we are more focused than ever before on fortifying our strengths, transforming the underperforming parts of our business and investing in the emerging opportunities that will provide either more profitable growth in the future for us. And as usual we'll look forward to sharing with you our progress as we go through the year. So, with that, why don't we open it up and start taking your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Just a first question on one of the big swing factors in 2016 being the $1.2 billion stock adjustment. Obviously that is a real thing, it's not one time, but it does indicate maybe you earned a little bit more in 2015 than you would have otherwise and that you took that hit in 2016. So the trajectory of earnings between '15 in '16 actually should be a bit better than what you are show in here. And as we look forward to 2017, your stock position, your inventories are relatively lean, I think very disciplined and good, but it does seem like there is a potential for you to, particularly as we get through the second half of the year, to maybe build a little bit of the inventory if the industry comes through. I'm just curious how you are thinking about this and if that logic makes sense to you. Bob Shanks : Well I think you're right in the first part, but that was driven by the launch of schedule and cadence that we had. So if you remember going back to '15 we were coming out of Dearborn and Kansas City for F-150s, so were really building stock. We also then had that pull ahead of rental into the early '16 periods. So again, we had to build stock for that. We then through this year, in the second half of the year we've taking the adjustments -- well, in fact, through the year, we've been taking the adjustments and so you're right, but it was driven by launch cadence and rental timing or cadence as opposed to anything else. When we move into 2017, John I think you\u2019re right, when you look at every single region, the way we look at it, our stock levels are in very, very good shape and then North America particular where there had been a lot of concern expressed by number of people throughout the year, we kept telling you that it was driven by the cadence of launches last year, this year and what was going on with rental and that we would be in good shape by the end of year and we're actually in very good shape. So we have delivered on that, every other region looks fine. As we look ahead to next year or this year rather in 2017, I think we just kind of hold that level. I don\u2019t see any big plus or minus on this particular factor in terms of impact on the company, it might be a little bit different by business unit but likely not, because I think everyone is in pretty good shape. I will highlight that we will have the launch of expedition navigator in the third quarter. So that will have an impact, it's not as high volume obviously, as some of the other launches we've had on those type -- on that type if platform in the past, but it is a very high margin vehicle. So it will have some effect, probably more in mix than anything else. Mark Fields : The only thing I'd add John, all these things are linked, right. As I mentioned any given year we're going to have launches and things of that nature. But when you look as Bob said, we're going to continue our strategy of matching productions and demand, but if you look at our incentives in the fourth quarter, the industry in the U.S. was up 16%, we were up 11% that really follows our strategy of being competitive but disciplined and that allowed us to have average transaction prices in the quarter that were up over 4% and better than the industry. So we're really trying to manage and maximize profitability. Listen, if there is opportunity and there is more business out there, we'll build more. If we're short in any given month, we'll take adjustments. We want to keep those stocks really in shape and be able to react appropriately. John Murphy : Okay, that's helpful. And then just a second question. I know there's a lot of puts and takes and things that are going on that you're discussing with Trump as far as new policies here. But just specifically around the potential for expensing CapEx and R&D, obviously in 2017 and 2018, you guys are talking about $2 billion to $3 billion of incremental expenses for EVs and Smart Mobility. And if we see expensing of costs like that could that give you a higher deductibility, which means that you might increase your deferred tax asset and not pay taxes for a longer period? I'm just trying to understand, if we look at that $2 billion to $3 billion, how much would have gotten expensed otherwise previously and would there be more that could get expensed now that would give you a big benefit going forward? Bob Shanks : Well, I think I would say on the -- I'll call it the blueprint tax proposal, so that\u2019s the only thing that's really on the table at the moment. There is a lot of different factors there. So a lot of people focused on the broader adjustable tax, focusing on the expensing of CapEx, I mean there is all sorts ins and outs and ups and downs, it just a completely different tax code. We have been modeling that which is what I mentioned at the Deutsche Bank Conference, it looks attractive to us and favorable, but it also depends on the detail, and we don\u2019t know that yet, John. I\u2019ll say that we are booking taxes at a healthy rate, we came in at let's say 32% or 31.9% for the quarter, I think it was about 30% for the year, if I remember correctly. We're booking at a healthy rate, because of the tax code we have, but our cash taxes are quite low and they're expected to remain low over the next number of years. And the modeling we've done, again it depends on the what the details are, but it doesn\u2019t suggest that that\u2019s going to change to any degree whatsoever. John Murphy : Okay, and then just one last quick housekeeping one on the accounting for leases. Obviously, you guys are accelerating depreciation where you need to on auction values that might be lower. Just curious, if we think about what we see in the P&L versus the timing of the cash impact to those when those vehicles come back for you and the industry. Is there a cash impact at the end of lease that we might see that's being reflected in the P&L right now on an accrual basis? Bob Shanks : No, I don\u2019t think it was anything materials I mentioned in that regard, no. Everyone here is shaking their heads, so, I think I'm right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino : The first question is really for you, Mark. You've had a couple of breakfasts this week with President Trump. And really wanted to get a sense of your thoughts coming out of there on the policies, how we're shaping the potential changes in the tax code, we've got the house plan that's out there. You clearly mentioned the prospects of an import tariff. Most clients that I speak to are either in one camp or the other that there is 100% probability of a border tax adjustment, and if that doesn't happen, then we're just going to see import tariffs. So really curious as to -- since you've spent the most time with the new President this week, I believe -- what's your thinking coming out of both those meetings and what you've been hearing? Mark Fields : Well I think first off it's a very positive sign from my perspective, that literally his first two days in the office is -- he had first morning meetings with manufacturing companies, including automotive companies. And I think he's going to be very focused on driving policies that drive investment and job creation in American manufacturing and in automotive manufacturing. And so I think that's going to be a big priority. I think obviously as Bob was mentioning earlier, a tax reform is going to be a big priority and I know obviously whether it's a border tax or border adjustment, as Bob mentioned, this is a multi-faceted blueprint that's out there. And as Bob said, we got to look at the statutory tax rates, we got to look at the territorial tax system that they're talking about expensing -- media expensing of CapEx and then whatever currency impacts are there. Our approach, as a company, is just going to stay very close to it and also provide input. So, I think tax reform is going to be high on the list. We did talk about -- he asked very clearly, what are the things that are inhibitors in terms of growing jobs, and your business, we talked about regulations, and particularly we talked about the rule making -- the finalized rule making that was pushed through at the end of the year on the fuel economy, one national standard which really was a decision that we felt was premature and inconsistent with the promise data driven approach, and we think that's really important to get a balanced outcome, balance between making sure that we reconcile interest in reducing carbon into the atmosphere which we're all for, but also with jobs, and also affordability for customers. So, we may see some actions on that which could be positive for our business but my impression walking away is this is the President who's going to be focused on a number of important priorities and make sure that he makes progress on those. And we want to be helpful in the process in terms of whether its trade or tax or regulatory reform, be a trusted source for input. David Tamberrino : Understood. That's very helpful. Maybe following up underneath of that, in the event that we don't see a border tax but we do see a potential import tariff and you start thinking about your supply chain, in particular, versus other of your competitors' supply chains. It looks like the cost of being able to produce a vehicle, specifically within the U.S. would have to go up with the amount of local content and then some of the imports come in. In that environment, do you see passing on price increases to consumers? Do you see pushing that through to the supply chain or you see that more impacting your margin? Just trying to get a feel for how you would manage the business for any potential change or rising cost environment as a result of a very targeted or potentially targeted import tariff? Mark Fields : Well as Bob, mentioned earlier you know, first of we have to see what the policies are going to be and as you mentioned we're doing a lot of different scenario planning, the blueprint -- every company is going to be like a snowflake, they are all going to be different, right, in terms of what their net imports or exports are, there supply chain. And we're going to just continue to advocate for comprehensive tax reform. And as Bob mentioned, the broader adjustment piece of this is very interring for us and the reason for that is, we are the largest producer of vehicles here in the U.S., we're a top exporter, obviously, we're doing the analysis on our supply chain because that\u2019s going to play into it. And we\u2019ll see how it comes out. It's going to be a -- I think a pretty -- getting to back to your question earlier, I think the President is going to look for an accelerated rate of getting some level of tax reform in this year and we want to be part of the process in terms of giving them the input on that. David Tamberrino : Thank you. The one last one for me is just in North America, as I think about one of your competitors is going through a bit of a changeover throughout this year. Is there a potential possibility for you to see better market share gains as a result of that? Or is that an opportunity for you to be more price disciplined as some of the competition volume might be pulling back and they might not be as aggressive on their incentives? Mark Fields : Well I just see coming back to our strategy, we run this business to optimize profitability for our shareholders, so we're going to continue our strategy of keeping our inventories in line, we're going to be very disciplined on pricing and continue our approach on making sure that our transaction prices are healthy, we're not going to chase bad share that\u2019s not what we do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Galliers with Evercore ISI. George Galliers : My first question was just on raw materials. Clearly we've seen a move in the spot price for a lot of commodities versus the full-year average for 2016. What kind of assumptions do you have for raw material headwinds this year? Mark Fields : So that\u2019s a really good question, George what we saw in 2016 is an advances and improvement, if you willing, from commodities of about $900 million. Our planning for 2017 and our guidance for 2017 basically assumes that almost all reverses. George Galliers : Okay, great. And, then secondly, just with respect to China -- and this isn't necessarily Ford specific, we're also seeing it at some of your peers. Volumes are growing both when we look at Q4 and on a full year basis. But when we look at profitability, clearly we're not seeing similar progress. Do you think that -- what's got to change, I guess, for absolute earnings from Chinese JVs to step up going forward? Is it a more stable pricing environment? Is it continued work on the cost front from yourselves? Or is it just -- is there some other factor? Mark Fields : Well let's just talk about the JVs first, because I just want to remind everybody, the JVs are not the total China picture for us, because we've got imports of Lincoln, we've got imports to Ford, we also incur engineering here as Ford, for products that will be build years ahead, and the JVs we get compensated on that through royalties. So there is a little bit of a disconnect there particularly as we're in growth mode. But just on the JVs, if you look at the JVs this year, perform was good, we actually had good cost performance in the Joint Ventures. We have two things that are happening to the JVs. One is this continued negative trend that we have seen of negative pricing across the industry, and as I've said it did moderate in '16 versus '15 and our assumptions for '17 is that it further moderates although it will still be negative. And then the second impact is on exchange. Now the exchange hit clearly affected our imports, foreign imports, the Lincoln imports, but while we have very high local content in the Joint Venture, they still import and so that also had a negative impact. It's really those two things that affected the overall business in China but also specifically Joint Ventures going forward. One of the thing that has been helping us has been the mix and that\u2019s been sort of a quiet of our recipe for success in North America, it has been in Europe and I think that\u2019s probably further opportunity for us in China moving ahead into the future. Bob Shanks : To put that in perspective, as you look at 2016, 40% of our sales in China came from more profitable segments, the large cars, SUVs, performance vehicles and premium and that was up about less than 1.5 points versus the year ago, so the teams is really focusing on that. And then to your point earlier on the industry, as you know we have guided the industry to be higher next year in China, but we do expect the end of the tax incentives or the reduction of tax incentives that happen at the end of last year, that\u2019s going to be a drag on industry sales and volumes probably through the first quarter. We've reflected that in our assumptions and we anticipate that the impact from the pull ahead is going to ease from the second quarter going forward, and it's supports our outlook a little over 27 million units. But we are seeing in January, a payback and the industry is seeing a payback. So we have to get through Chinese New Year is early this year, so let's get through January and February and then I think we'll have a better idea of the run rate as we get into the end of the first quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Rod Lache, Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache : I wanted to just -- I had two things. One is, again, on border adjustments. We came up with an estimate that, just for the overall industry, not Ford specifically, this is something that could potentially increase the cost of a vehicle sold in the U.S. by $2,300. And at the same time it looked to us like the effect would be really small for Ford. And I'm wondering if you've done a similar competitive analysis. Should we be watching this as one of the more potentially significant changes to the competitive landscape? And post your meetings, if you have any thoughts on timing of implementation, whether there could be a phase in? In other words, is this something that we should be thinking about as maybe a factor or even in the intermediate term, like 2018, 2019? Bob Shanks : Let me comment first Ron and then Mark can add comments that he might have. So we have been modelling it as I said the one thing -- so your assumption in terms of how we stand versus competition is how we see it. We are in a pretty good place in terms of import, export position as we look at vehicles as we look at our parts. So we see that as being something that's attractive. Then when you combine with somebody other aspects of the blueprint like the lower tax rate and some of the other aspects plus an assumption that we've made through discussions with the staff that are working on this that some of the things that are important to us like tax attributes will continue into the future. That's what gives us at least for now a positive point of view on that for just a proposal. When we look at our competition we can't see if you will the data around parts, we just can't find source for that anywhere, but we fairly can understand imports and exports of vehicles, and when we look at that again you're right relative to our peers that we're in very good shape and versus some of them extremely good shape. So, it could have an adverse impact in terms of them, if what we see now as a proposal passes through and for us it looks pretty attractive and actually not having too much impact at all over the next several years in terms of our cash taxes. Mark Fields : And to Bob's point on -- when you look at our profile, I mean you know the facts Ron, we're the number one manufacturer in the U.S. and also, Ford's not one of the top manufacturers in Mexico. So that adds to our profile. When you look at some of the nuances on how this will be laid out, whether there'll be phase-ins or things of that nature, I think that's work in front of the administration and Congress going forward. There'll be lots of discussion, there'll be a lot of sausage making around this to see ultimately what happens. My view is as I go back earlier, I think there're going to want to make a significant progress this year and get something passed through Congress this year and I think Paul Ryan last night laid out getting something done by August. Now whether they'll be able to do that, I don't know. But clearly that's their intent. Rod Lache : Great, thank you. And just secondly, obviously, the market's expectations, vis-\u00e0-vis U.S. growth and inflation and monetary policy have changed a lot here in the past couple months, but your guidance didn't really change since the Investor Day. I was hoping you might be able to just give us some color on how this could affect North America and also the Credit business, whether you see some implications for rates that could be more significant in terms of recent rates, for example. And then in Credit, how should we be thinking about the financing margin and broadly just as the market is transitioning from looser monetary to tighter monetary policy? Bob Shanks : Now let me take a short at first and then again if there are some broader perspectives, Mark can share. So, I think what we're seen so far, is the market is excited and interested, intrigued and optimistic about what might happen. But we don't have any policies yet. So, I don't -- we don't know. So, we're hopeful, we're also optimistic, encouraged about what might be, but nothing really has changed yet other than maybe sentiment, I think that's -- it's fair to say sentiment has changed. So, until we see something more definitive, we're not changing our point of view in terms of what our operating assumptions are. And in fact, I think so far this month in January, I think the rate of sales that we've seen for the industry suggest that there's nothing that would tell us that anything is any different than what we've been assuming. And we've built in increasing interest rates, both for this year and going forward. So, we kind of already assumed what you've talked about, the question is, if we do get a very positive pro-growth strategies that are much more inflationary than what has been assumed? Then obviously, there is an impact there and it would affect many parts of business both pro and con, something that we would manage and deal with as we always do. But there's nothing specific to respond to yet Ron. Rod Lache : Right. Well, the market rates, Bob, like five-year swaps are up like 75 basis points since November. So the market is starting to reflect a different paradigm. And I would imagine that that's very meaningful, just broadly, on a number of different fronts. So that's more or less what I was asking about [Multiple Speakers]. Bob Shanks : But so far what we seeing as been consisting with what our planning assumptions have been. And we did build in increasing interest rates. I think we're going to market couple of times and everything is consistent with what we had expected in terms of -- actually we're seeing good spreads and I think the rates have been consistent with what we have planned. I understand your point, but it hasn't materialized yet into anything physical that would be different on our planning assumptions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : A couple questions. Housekeeping and then a more strategic one again related here to the White House. Housekeeping, anything you can comment around quarterly cadence particularly in North America, particularly getting through some of the destock? Mark Fields : While as I mentioned earlier I think the destock is behind us. On a company basis, it usually 60-40 in terms of profits, first half, second half I would expect something like that this year. I always hesitate to get into the specific quarters because I'm inevitably wrong, but last year was very unusual, the year before was very unusual, the flip side of that because of the launches. I would say I think the third quarter in North America will be the weakest and that\u2019s going to bed driven by the impact of the launch of the expedition navigator. But other than that I would call a more normal year in terms of cadence. Brian Johnson : Okay, when I said destock, I meant overstock, if you will, in 1Q of last year. On a strategic question, in addition to what the NHTSA and the EPA control directly around fuel economy and environmental regulations of the EPA, EPA has historically, at least in the eight years, granted California a waiver to pursue its own greenhouse gas policy. Was there any discussion at the White House around the theme of harmonization of fuel economy and environmental regulation? And sort of the debate, maybe too philosophical, around is this state's rights versus federalism in terms of getting to a harmonized system once again? Mark Fields : Well we didn\u2019t get into discussion around states rights versus federalism in the meeting, but what we did talk about and I get back to earlier, where we said, we weren't advocating for elimination of the standards. I made the point that, one of the reasons we were very supportive of the One National Standard is because it was one national standard. You had CARB, the California Air Resources Board, together with NHTSA, together with EPA and we emphasized that was important going forward. Brian Johnson : Well, what if CARB decides to continue to stick to its aggressive goals, perhaps even more aggressive? What do you think the new administration will do through the EPA waiver process? Mark Fields : I think you have to ask the administration that question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Hi, just shifting maybe away from North America for a minute on South America, just given the flattish losses in the fourth quarter, could you just talk a little bit about what some of the drivers for improvement in 2017 might be? Perhaps the magnitude, roughly, if you can share? And then also a similar question around the non-China Asia Pacific improvement that you are expecting for 2017. Mark Fields : Well, as you go back to Slide 32, Itay, if you want to go back there. I think this slide shows what the ups and downs are, if you will, on a year-over-year basis. So in South America we do expect to see positive net pricing, we do expect to see favorable volume, even though it doesn\u2019t look like the industries are moving much when you look at the industry slide that\u2019s really due to rounding. We still see exchange as a bit of a headwind including and also cost including commodities, so it's really around favorable volume and mix and especially pricing. So that\u2019s what we see happening. And it does require the external environment to sort of move forward in a positive direction. And if you go back to the slide, that has our assumptions on GDP, we've had a very modest projection of 0.5% GDP improvement, which is consistent I think with the Brazilian Banks we're talking to and a few other, so I think it's in the range of what most people are expecting. But I also would say, at least based on the data we've been looking at on a month-to-month basis, it could be more of a second half recoveries than a first half at least in terms of the strength of that, driving that full year result. Not going to get into quantification of magnitude on any of the business units, but I think it will be -- we're expecting it to be a reasonably good improve on a year-over-year basis. But we'll still be in a loss. Then you asked me on Asia Pacific, I think you are asking around the specific the non-China? Itay Michaeli : Current. Mark Fields : Yes, so I got to tell -- we're so excited about that because we've been talking about this for a long, long time. Australia was really having a tough time particularly prior to going into the restructuring and the manufacturing and then after we announced it. ASEAN on was struggling India, of course a big investments and growth node there. And we are still excited because we are now seeing big turnaround particularly in ASEAN in Australia, we see profits -- strong profits in those parts of the business in 2017, and that\u2019s really what's driving the improvement. But even India will be a loss again in 2017, we see a less of loss. So overall that part of the business in Asia Pacific is really moving forward in a positive direction and something we have been working very, very hard at. Bob Shanks : And importantly on Australia, we actually completed the closer, the manufacturing facility last year in October, November timeframe. So the team is really focused on not only building our business, but we made announcements late last year around building our engineering capability in Australia, so right direction from the momentum. Itay Michaeli : That's very, very helpful. Just a quick follow-up, back to North America on Slide 15. The positive other driver, I think of about $250 million, was that mostly parts and accessories? And, if so, what's the outlook for that business globally in 2017? Bob Shanks : That\u2019s was part of it, you are looking at what Slide 15, did you say? Itay Michaeli : Yes, Slide 15, the two [Multiple Speakers]. Bob Shanks : Yes, it was parts of service we also had lower legal cost, we have some favorable performance from some of the subsidiaries within North America and there were just other -- just a whole slew of smaller things that added up. But yes, it included good performance in parts and service, which offer the business in 2016 did very well across the globe. Itay Michaeli : Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Some more questions to try to probe this border adjusted tax issue. I just wanted to confirm that your comment at the Detroit show that a border adjusted tax could be potentially a positive not just on a relative but an absolute basis. Does that analysis take into account not just the vehicles that you're importing and exporting but also the parts that you purchase from suppliers that might be imported? And then as part of your answer, it would be great, too, if you could remind us of your export strategy, because going back to that Europe turnaround call in October of 2012, I think it was, you mentioned then your plan to ramp exports from the U.S. And since then now you're exporting to China, too. So maybe your exports are greater than the market appreciates. Any color or data you could share would be helpful. Bob Shanks : Let me take that first part and then Mark can respond on the second. So, to be specific, yes, in an absolute sense more outside of our business centric because we're actually modeling this out many-many years, because you have to do that with the first taxes. So it actually can be quite favorable it absolute sense, sort of I'll call it beyond our five-year business planning period. Through our business planning period it's probably more neutral, and that's both in terms of an absolute tax, but in particular to cash tax status that I mentioned earlier. The bigger opportunity in terms of the big change versus where we are today it's more sort of post 2021 in terms of the assessment that we've made. Mark Fields : In terms of Ryan your question on that export strategy from -- let's say here from North America, as you know what we've talked about in the past is utilizing our manufacturing operations globally, and be better exporters, if you will, and balancing and basically using our manufacturing assets around the world. And that's why in Europe for example coming out of the U.S. we added the Edge which is doing very well in the marketplace. We're getting the new KA+ out of India. And in terms of other exports out of the U.S. as I said we're a top exporter and part of it is when you look at China for example we're exporting Explorers, Lincoln, we talked about the road fair, actually we have a -- when you take into account imports of parts, we actually we have a -- from the U.S. we're actually -- we're in a net surplus in terms of our trade with China with the exports that we do out of here in the U.S. So, we're going to continue to utilize our manufacturing assets very efficiently around the globe and this is all around our strategy taking advantage of our scale and making sure we're taking advantage of the assets that we've in different parts of the world. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, thanks. And then just my last question is really what was better than you thought in 4Q because you did $10.4 billion of full year pretax versus $10.2 billion that [indiscernible] at the time of 3Q. So versus our own expectations, it was North America Automotive. I know you don't guide granularly quarterly by region, but was it the Super Duty? Was it some of these profit improvement initiatives that you talked about on the 2Q call? Did those track better or whatnot? And is there any way to say that maybe the stronger profits in 4Q bode well as we enter 2017 relative to guidance or anything like that? Mark Fields : So, Ryan you're asking specifically about North America? Ryan Brinkman : Or just what contributed to the implied -- the $200 million implied beat [ph] versus your implied guidance for 4Q, basically, on pretax? Mark Fields : Cost. Ryan Brinkman : Costs. And do those costs continue -- was that one-time period benefit or is there now a stronger base of earnings that you carry into 2017? Mark Fields : Well it's interesting when we look at the year-over-year costs changed for the total company, I went back and looked a number of years, this is the lowest cost increase that we've had on a year-over-year basis, since I think going back to 2009 or something like that. So, actually we've seen -- we've got a lot of control on cost, North America was a big contributor to that, and that certainly helped us in our performance throughout the course of the year. As we move into 2017, we've talked about the investments that we're making and the emerging opportunities. If I put that to decide the commodity increase that I talked about, I think everything else actually should be a cost save in 2017. And we have to work hard to do that, but it does show the focus that we put on cost and continue and I get I would highlight what we showed at the Deutsche Bank conference, within all of that we got about $3 billion worth of efficiencies that we're generating right across the business, its helping us to continue the investments we're making for growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Just a quick one here. Alphabet and Waymo seem to have gone around to all the OEMs globally, and I suspect yourselves included, to try to look for a way to work with you on sharing data, creating HD maps and helping your efforts in the autonomous driving revolution. I was just curious if you could reiterate your stance on data sharing with suppliers like a Waymo or Mobileye that ostensibly want to help develop a common crowdsourced 3D map, for example, amongst other things. How do you view the opportunity to do that versus do-it-yourselves, because you obviously have huge scale globally on miles traveled to maybe do that yourself? How do you weigh that and, again of course, versus the value of the data and the sanctity of the data? Mark Fields : Thanks Adam, in the key as that last part of your statement. We have to look at what the value of the data is. Certainly there is different -- there is a broad spectrum here and very simply put, we continue to be open to work with partners where we can crowd source data that helps the system as opposed to just an individual manufacturer. So we're going to continue to go through that process and really understand the value of the data and when the value of the data -- it points very clearly to working with other, we'll do so. And it all comes down to, as you look at that value of the data, keep going back to what I mentioned a long time ago, we don\u2019t want to be relegated to a contract manufacturer status and that\u2019s always in top of our mind. Adam Jonas : Okay. Because there seem to be different views there. Toyota, for example, seems to have this : We're big enough and we can do it ourselves and its early days and we don't want to make a decision on sharing too early and regret it later. Perhaps Chrysler might be on the opposite side of the spectrum of, we'll cross the line early and work early. I reckon maybe you're somewhere in between. But I'm just curious in terms of timing, do you think that this year would be too soon for you to make a decision? Or is it -- is there even one avenue to go and there may not -- there's no such thing as exclusivity, whether you do-it-yourselfer with a partner? I'm just curious [Multiple Speakers]. Mark Fields : I can't answer your question in terms of the timing of it but, clearly you know what our objectives are, is to have a level four vehicle out in the market place in 2021. So clearly we have a lot of work to do in front of us, but also at the same time we've made a lot of progress and as we said we'll go through that process, what's the data we feel crowd sourced is fine, doesn't have a lot of value, but has a lot of valuing to the system versus what's the one that will have value to us as we looked at new business models to grow our business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Colin Langan : Just a follow-up on all the border tax questions -- border adjustment questions. One of the key elements there is the impact of all this cost and what it might do to actual industry volume. Any color on the price sensitivity that you would see if we see all these border tax pushing costs up, how much auto sales may fall? Mark Fields : No, I don\u2019t think we have a handle on that, that was part of Rod's concern or question as well. There is another aspect too that we're going to have to look at, which is, what impact did this have on exchange rates. That\u2019s something else that's been mentioned in the strength of the dollar. So the thing that's really kind of interesting but also very complex about this whole thing, so radically different that, it's go way beyond just what's the tax effect it could grow the economy, so that\u2019s a positive. It could strengthen the dollar that\u2019s got positives and negatives. The point that you mentioned around pricing and affordability that one also could be interesting because, again based on a relative position that individual companies can have, there is probably an industry effect that could be quite different by individual companies. So I just can't answer, we don\u2019t know enough at this time Colin, to give you feel for that. But it's certainly something that we are aware of and we will be looking at as we get more specifics around the proposal itself as it works its way through congress. Colin Langan : And Trump has talked about a focus on jobs. I think you even mentioned -- I think he even tweeted about it and having a plant opened in the U.S. What would actually -- would you consider, particularly at this point in the cycle, actually putting a whole new physical brick and mortar plant in the U.S.? And what with the criteria be for you to go forward and do something like that, if that what is the objective here? Bob Shanks : Well, getting to the first part of your question, obviously as you know we canceled the plan down in Mexico because the bottom line is we saw was happening with the segment, we did need the capacity anymore and it didn\u2019t make any sense to add it, particularly now also where we are in a cycle. And going forward, the criteria for -- if we ever build any capacity anywhere, is the growth of our business. And we're comfortable with where we are right now. But we have made announcements, we are expanding our Flat Rock facility to build the new autonomous vehicle and the new battery electric vehicle SUV that\u2019s coming down the pipe. And as you know, Colin, the things, we look at a lot different factors, both the capacity and where we put it. Everything from logistics to labor cost, the business environment, to tax treatment, et cetera. And we'll continue to look at those things going forward. But nothing on the plate right now in terms of brand new facility somewhere, but we are expanding some. Colin Langan : And one question I get a lot from investors is you are guiding earnings down, but a lot of your peers, particularly your tracked U.S. peers are guiding earnings up. I imagine a big chunk is the investment in EV and mobility. Do you think you have some catching up to do? Is that why there is a big outlier there? Or is there another reason that you're a bit more cautious than your tracked competitors. Any thoughts on that? I would love to get your perspective since investors continuously ask. Mark Fields : Well, I\u2019ll give mine first. I mean first of all we have been running at a very strong rate for seven year. So some are catching up to the level of performance that we have been at. But when we look at going into 2017, again I can't talk to others and what's happening in their business, launches or anything else, but we're going to continue the operate in terms of the core Automotive business at a very, very strong level. It will change in terms of the construct of various factors and probably among the business units because things are different year-by-year. But we think overall the bottom line result for core Automotive will continue to run at a strong rate. Credit will come down for the reasons that we have talked about. The higher net interest expense, but really the difference is around the investments in the emerging opportunities. And we think that those are sort of like where we're planting the seed and we know that we're going to harvest the results. Probably more towards next decade. But this is going to transform the business. So it's something that we're really looking forward to doing and it's the right thing to do for the business. So, we'll have to see where we all end up when the year is out, but we believe that the call that we're making for the business is the right one for us and is still going to generate a strong result and as you know from what we've said around distributions, we're still going to provide shareholders with strong distributions in the year, $2.8 billion. Colin Langan : And what about the notion that you're catching up to your peers? Do you disagree with that particularly on EVs? Or do you think maybe you are having to catch up a little bit on a relative basis? Bob Shanks : Well Colin, I absolutely disagree with that in terms of if you look at electrification, I mean we've sold over 0.5 million electrified vehicles since 2004 and when you look at the breadth of HEVs, PHEVs and also battery electric vehicle that we have, it's one of the broadest. And we've made a commitment now as you know to expand that even further, that $4.5 billion and the 13 products that we've talked about, a number of them. So, we strongly believe that we've lead in this area from a development of the market standpoint, we're working now as was mentioned earlier on infrastructure in various parts of the world for EVs, so we're going to continue to keep ploughing ahead on this. No, I don't believe that we are behind. Operator : We'll now take questions from the media. We've a question from the line of Patti Waldmeir with Financial Times. Patti Waldmeir : One question please for Mr. Fields, you were obviously one of the first to stress the positive side of a Trump Presidency for corporate America, but could you say to me about how it feels never to know when you're going to have to deal with, at the very least, a significant markets fallout from a Presidential tweet, could you -- what word would you use to describe your mood in this new normal? And a question for Mr. Shanks, you said that there was a $200 million charge related to the Mexico cancellation, but I've also seen a $500 million figure for -- of savings for consolidating small car production related to the cancelation of that factory and I'm not sure where that figure comes from, could you say something about that? Bob Shanks : Let me do that first, and then Mark can respond on how he feels. [Multiple Speakers] So, yes, the $200 million is a charge that we're taking in the fourth quarter, because we've made a decision towards the latter part of the year. So we've booked that in the fourth quarter. In terms of the$500 million, that was the net save, if you will, in terms of capital spending. And we talked about that at the time that we announced the cancellation. So we will save $500 million in capital related to the cancellation of this factory. Mark Fields : Getting back to how do I feel? I feel good, and the reason I feel good Patti is because you talk about -- you're basically talking about the external environment, and how are you ready for things? And it's been the way that we've been running this business for years now. We're always looking at the external environment, literally every day, we're doing the right things for the business, we're being proactive, we act decisively. So whether it's a tweet from somebody or a market disruption in another or a natural disaster and in some part of the world, we're going to be ready because we are just watching that external environment everyday and it keeps us riveted on the business. Operator : This concludes the fourth quarter and full year 2016 Ford earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Dee-Ann Durbin - The Associated Press Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Ford Motor Company Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions, following the prepared remarks. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Ted Cannis, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Ted Cannis - Ford Motor Company : All right. Thanks very much, Maria. Good morning and welcome everybody to Ford Motor Company's first quarter 2017 earnings review. Presenting today are Mark Fields, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer; also participating are John Lawler, Vice President and Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President and Corporate Treasurer and CFO of Ford Smart Mobility; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Marion Harris, Ford Credit CFO. The results today includes some of our non-GAAP references, these are reconciled to the GAAP measures in the appendix of the slides, also today includes Ford's earnings material and Ford Credit's earnings material presentation, as we're no longer holding a Ford Credit calls, so you have an all one-in-one package here. Today's discussion includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance, of course actual results may vary, and most of the significant factors are included in the presentation. So with that, what we'd like to do is pass over to Mark Fields. Mark? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. As you can see on slide 3, we're focused on three sets of as strategic priorities and importantly taking the actions that will drive value for our shareholders as we expand to an auto and a mobility company. And we are reallocating capital to fortify our core strengths, transform underperforming parts of our business, and investing aggressively but prudently in emerging opportunities. And while we reallocate capital in each of these areas, that decision making is being governed by where to play, where not to play, and how to win. So with that as a backdrop, what I would like to do is take you through our first quarter results. So in the first quarter, as you can see on slide 4, we delivered total company adjusted pre-tax profit of $2.2 billion, which was lower than our best ever quarterly profit a year ago. Importantly, revenue was up and that reflects favorable mix. All the other key metrics were down and our adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.39. We're reaffirming that we will remain on plan for our full-year guidance and we continue to expect total company adjusted pre-tax profit to be about $9 billion this year with stronger profits in 2018. Now, turning to slide 5, our strategic priorities are focused on the four drivers of shareholder value \u2013 growth, risk, returns, and rewards. So let me take you through each one of these. In terms of growth, we grew our top-line in the quarter with company revenue up 4% and that was driven by favorable mix. Here in the U.S. our average transaction prices increased by nearly four times the industry average. Lincoln sales continue to show improvement. They were up 24% globally in the quarter and that was 9% in the U.S. and 114% in China.. In terms of risk, we're sitting at $28 billion in cash, which provides both protection in the current business environment, but also reflects the potential for strategic acquisitions and other prudent investments in the years ahead. In addition to that we remain fit for any future downturn in North America with a healthy breakeven SAAR at 11 million units in the U.S. And finally in terms of risk, our global funded pension plans are nearly fully funded and de-risked. And Ford Credit continues to be disciplined while at the same time being a very healthy contributor to our bottom line. In returns, we had $2 billion in cash flow in the quarter. We delivered our eighth consecutive profitable quarter in Europe. And we had our second consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvements across all key metrics in South America, and that includes market share. And then finally in terms of rewards, shareholders benefited from our continued success and also our strong cash generation, as we distributed $800 million in the quarter. And that includes a supplemental dividend that totaled $200 million. Turning to slide 6, this summarizes the progress that we're making on executing our strategic priorities. And we are fortifying our profit pillars, including our leadership and strong global franchise in trucks. We've announced that we'll be launching an upgraded F-150 in the second half of the year and reintroducing Ranger to North America in 2019. And this introduction will help us expand our 40-year leadership in full-size trucks, while introducing a competitive entry into the U.S. midsize pickup segment \u2013 pickup truck segment with an addressable retail market of more than $12 billion. In utilities, we introduced the all-new Expedition, which is a critical vehicle in helping us capture market share in the small but lucrative full-size SUV segment. We also announced the global introduction of Bronco coming in 2020. And in performance, we have a true global leader with our Mustang. Mustang is now sold in 140 countries. And Mustang was the best selling sports car in the world in 2016. And to reinforce our continued leadership and to fortify that pillar in performance, our new 2018 Mustang is coming this fall. When it comes to transforming traditionally underperforming parts of our business, our transformation of Lincoln continues to gain momentum. We introduced the first all-new Lincoln Navigator in more than a decade. And we also announced plans to manufacture an all-new Lincoln SUV in China for the Chinese market, which will have the benefits of improving profitability and cash flow, while at the same time allowing us to better respond to market needs more quickly. And when it comes to growing in the emerging opportunities, I think we've clearly laid out our electrification strategy, playing to our strengths and electrifying vehicles to provide more capability and productivity and performance and better fuel economy for our customers. And I believe a prime example of this is our unveiling a couple of weeks ago of the industry's first pursuit-rated hybrid police car. And I believe that further cements our strong franchise among law enforcement and cities by delivering a hybrid vehicle that will power the high electrical loads of a police vehicle, but also reduce engine runtime and reducing emissions. So with that as an overview, let me turn it over to Bob. And he'll take us through the details of our business performance. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay, Mark, thanks. And good morning, everybody. On slide 8, that's where we'll start. And what I'll do \u2013 as usual, Mark has already touched on a number of the metrics on the slide, I will also cover some of the other ones later in the presentation. So I want to focus my comments here only on the things that you will only see on this particular slide. So let's start first with the special items pre-tax sort of in the middle of the slide. You can see they came in at a favorable $24 million, $210 million better than a year ago. And that is driven by the fact that we reassessed the cancellation charges associated with the cancellation of our plant in Mexico. We booked that in the fourth quarter. It was $199 million. We've taken that down by $46 million, so the cancellations charges on that basis would be $153 million. So that's what's driving the $24 million. The balance are European separation costs. When you look at the year-over-year, the $210 million good news is lower separation costs associated with our European restructuring actions, as well as that $46 million improvement in the cancellation charge that's related to Mexico. The second point I want to make is around our adjusted effective tax rate. It came in at 28.6% for the quarter. That was 80 basis points better than a year ago and consistent with our full-year guidance of an adjusted effective tax rate of about 30%. And then the last point is on the lower right of the slide in the text. We came in with an adjusted EPS of $0.39. Only about a month ago I suppose, I guided to $0.30 to $0.35 based on what we were looking at at that time. The $0.39, that difference is due to favorable timing of cost performance and wholesale volume largely in North America. But we did see some good news in other parts of the business. So this is timing. And we don't see it having any impact on our outlook for the full year. All right. Let's move on to slide 9. What we're looking at here is total company absolutes and the reporting segment absolutes. So we have solid results for the total company. Solid results for automotive at $2 billion, which made up the bulk of the company's results. Solid results in the financial services segment at $466 million and within that Ford Credit at $481 million, which we'll cover a bit later. And then, to the far right, you can see all other, a loss of $212 million. Most of that, in fact almost all of that, was net interest expense on our automotive debt. There was a very small loss at our FSM, Ford Smart Mobility LLC. And then when you go below the chart, you can see the changes on a year-over-year basis. And I want to spend a little bit of time here. And I'll do this in selective places throughout my comments this morning. In the lower left you can see a decline of $1.6 billion in the quarter year-over-year and this was against last year's record results. We have guided for the full year to a total company adjusted pre-tax profit at $9 billion. Last year, we made $10.4 billion. So we're expecting a decline year-over-year of roughly $1.4 billion. Effectively, that decline has happened this quarter. Now when we look at the next three quarters, they will be up and down. But if we look at the aggregate of the second, third and fourth quarters, and compare that to the same period in 2016, we expect those results to be essentially flat to a little bit better. So effectively, this is the quarter in which the full year decline flows through to our full year results. When we think about what's going to happen in terms of our absolutes, we expect the third quarter to be the lowest absolute. And that's going to be driven by normal seasonal factors, the plant shutdowns in the U.S. and Europe, but also the launch of the Expedition and the Navigator. So with that let's move on to the next slide, slide 10. This is the Automotive segment absolute results. So a $2 billion total profit. You can see North America, Europe and Asia Pacific profitable with losses in South America and Middle East and Africa. And when you go below the chart, you can see that all of the operations were down on a year-over-year basis with the exception of South America with an improvement. Go to the following slide. And here we're looking at the key metrics for the Automotive segment. They're all down across the board with the exception of revenue. You can see revenue is up a bit and that is driven by favorable mix. These metrics were in the context of a global industry that was about flat on a year-over-year basis. As you look at our market share, our market share was down three-tenths of a point that was driven by China and by the U.S., and we'll get into the details on that when we get to the appropriate regional slides. Let's go to the following slide. So this is what drove the change in profitability for the Automotive segment. So $1.6 billion for the company, $1.5 billion in Automotive, so this is where almost all the decline for the company occurred. And as you look at it, you can see there are three major drivers; one, unfavorable costs. So if you look at contribution cost, structural cost, that's a $1.2 billion, so a $1.2 billion of the $1.5 billion was cost increase, and we'll talk about that in detail. Secondly, is lower volume. So if you look at the volume and mix and look at the callout box above that, you can see we had $400 million of good news on mix, so that positive story continues in the quarter. So we had about $0.5 billion of unfavorable performance related to volume, that was the second factor. And the third was around exchange, and that was driven by the sterling, that's the Brexit effect that's coming true, the Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real. So in terms of cost, the cost performance was basically around higher warranty expense. So we had guided to during the quarter about a $300 million increase related to recall, so that's one effect. We also had increased reserves for coverages, engineering expense, so that is not actually emerging opportunities, that is increases related to as, Mark was talking about relocation of capital to our fortified pillars, so this is around those utilities, the five new utilities we've guided to between now and the end of the year. So you're seeing the engineering come true for that, as well as on trucks and advancing commercial vehicles. Product cost that's basically the effect of the launches that we had last year post first quarter, and Super Duty is the biggest one which took place in the second half. So on a year-over-year business we are seeing that cost because it actually wasn't in the first quarter a year ago. And finally, commodities, we'll talk about that in the next slide. So when we look at the full year for cost, we're up a $1.2 billion in the quarter. So how should we think about that? If you look at the lower left or rather the left side of the slide, this is what we're expecting for the full year, it's just a bit more than a $1.2 billion. So, again, just as I talked about on process, for cost, our view is that basically the cost increase that we're seeing in the quarter is a cost increase that flows through to the full year. When you look at the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarters individually, there will be some ups and downs. But again, if I look at the aggregate of those quarters, cost should be effectively flat or maybe up a little bit. Now this is the same slide that we showed at Deutsche Bank when we gave our initial guidance for the year. The pattern of ups and downs is exactly the same as what we talked about at Deutsche Bank. If you go to the far right of the slide, those are the increases related to emerging opportunities, those are the investments and costs in electrification, autonomy, mobility, connectivity, data and analytics. That is going to represent about two-thirds of the full year cost increase. So if you take that bar, move it all the way to the left, that's about two-thirds of that. The balance is basically the net of the rest, which is around the core business. We're still expecting to see efficiencies net of economics of about nearly $3 billion, and that is net of commodity increases of over a $1 billion. So those efficiencies mostly offset the investments in the core business also price related design, which actually brings revenue with that, and also regulatory cost. So this is our view for the full year. So just as just as with profits, we think most of the cost increase for the full year has happened in the quarter closer to the full year.. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: And let me just make an additional comment and explanation point on cost, We are continuing our intense focus on cost and the reason for that is not only mindful of the current environment that we're in, but also I think preparing us even more for a downturn scenario, which we've talked to you about in the past. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Let's move on to the first of the regions, North America. Many of the things I talked about for the Automotive segment apply directly to North America. So these are the key metrics. You can see they're lower with the exception of revenue and as with the Automotive segment, that revenue is driven by favorable mix. This was in an industry that was down about 300,000 units that was both for the region, but it was driven by the U.S. Our market share was lower for the region, it was driven again by the U.S., market share in the U.S. was down 0.4, that was more than explained by fleet. Fleet was down six-tenths of point. Within that, about half of that was rental, the rest was a commercial and government lease, we think that's largely timing. That was offset partially by an improved retail share that was up to two-tenths of a point and that was strong performance of that series, our utilities and also Lincoln. Let's move to the next slide and look at the decline in profitability. For North America, $1.1 billion from the record results last year. And you can see it's exactly the same pattern of things that I talked about for the Automotive segment, and it's exactly the same reason. So I won't go into details here, but that pattern continued here. In terms of guidance for the full year, it's essentially the same thing that I said earlier. We're expecting North America to be solid in terms of its actually strong portfolio results but down from last year. It's going to be driven due to higher cost. We think we'll also see some efficiencies coming through in all the other cost categories that will give us partial offset. We also see exchange as being unfavorable. And the majority just as we talked about for the total business and automotive, the majority of North Americas full year profit decline and increase in cost has occurred in the first quarter. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: So if we turn to slide 16, what I'd like to do is just dive a bit deeper into our disciplined approach to the marketplace. So for example, if you look at the upper left of the chart here, our average transaction prices in the first quarter grew nearly four times faster than the industry, and that's really due to the great performance of F-Series and the continued growth of Lincoln as I mentioned earlier. In addition, like F-150, we reinvested some of the Super Duty aluminum weight savings into capability and features, our customers appreciate and most importantly, are willing to pay for. We also saw F-150 transaction prices increase with strong demand for the new Raptor. At the same time, we also continued our disciplined approach to incentives. And while incentives grew for the industry, as you can see, Ford levels were relatively flat as we managed supply and demand well and that we benefit obviously from the strength of our new products. If you look at stocks, our U.S. stocks are in very good shape and we continue to take a disciplined approach to matching production to demand. And just a note, our day supply, Ford's day supply tends to be slightly higher than the industry average, because of our stronger position in trucks due to the large number of product configurations which is a real strength of ours. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay, let's move on to South America and this is a story of improvement. This is the second consecutive quarter where all the metrics have improved and this was in an industry that actually did grow. You can see the SAAR was up 3%, Brazil unfortunately didn't grow but the positive sign was that in the month of March for the first time in 24 months we had a monthly improvement in the SAAR. So we are seeing positive signs even if Brazil starts to show up. We did generate positive revenue in the quarter and that was around volume, pricing and exchange. And our market share was up and that was on the back of the strength of the Ka, our sub-compact, as well as the Ranger. If we go to the following slides, we can see what happened in terms of causal factor. It was driven by higher net pricing and volume. Those are the key drivers. Inflation, what was behind the total cost increase and then you can see the exchange, which was driven by the real. In terms of guidance, we are seeing signs of improvement in the economic environment of South America. PMIs are looking better, consumer confidence is better, the Central Bank has been cutting its policy rates pretty aggressively and so we believe that we are close to the trough of this current economic cycle. As a result, we continue to believe that the South America will see an improvement in terms of loss this year relative to last year and that will be driven by the favorable market factors tied to the economic recovery. We think most of the improvement for the full year will take place in the second half of the year. And that's tied to the momentum that we expect to start to occur in terms of the economic environment. All right. Let's move to Europe. Europe had another profitable quarter, the eighth in a row. So feel very, very good about what's happening in Europe despite the effects of Brexit. We are seeing a growing industry in which we gained shares. So very positive overall performance across our European business. You can see that revenue was up that was driven by volume and mix. The share was up. This was driven by Cougar and our commercial vehicles. And once again in the quarter, the Ford brand was the number one selling commercial vehicle brand in the market. So feel very good about that performance. When you go to the following slide and look what's behind the results, you can see that the results were profitable, they were down on a year-over-year basis and this was due to higher cost. Some of that associated with the launch of the all new Fiesta. Some of it related to increased manufacturing costs to support the higher volume that we're projecting for the full year, but also related to recall. So Europe was one of the business units that was affected by the recalls that we announced during the first quarter. About $100 million affected their results for that particular factor. In terms of our outlook for Europe, we continue to expect Europe to remain profitable, although at levels below 2016. The key factors driving the decline are going to be the weaker sterling, but also higher costs particularly associated with the launch of the Fiesta and the EcoSport, which is coming later this year, as well as for continued investment for future growth. We do expect to see favorable market factors and we saw in the quarter again, and we expect the full year to see a continued improvement in Russia. The majority of the full-year profit decline in 2016 is expected to occur in the first half of this year due to cost and stock effects related to the Fiesta launch and also the major recall I just referenced that took place in the first quarter. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: So let me just provide a couple of additional comments on European business. And I just want to reemphasize that we remain committed to our strategy in Europe, as you know, which has been focused on product, brand, and cost. And taken the actions necessary to ensure that our business not only remains competitive, but also delivers sustainable returns. So on that, on the revenue side, we'll continue to take actions to increase the mix of higher margin vehicles and that includes adding the ST-Line for both EcoSport and S-MAX in the second half of this year, and also launching what we call the active and then the Vignale trim levels on the new Fiesta. So, work on the revenue side of the equation. But let me also just talk about in terms of what we see in the market and addressing specifically the drop in diesel demand in Europe. The industry in the quarter was down about 4 points to 46%, our mix is about 45%, so just a tad lower. And our product and our manufacturing plant is flexible and I believe we're well positioned to meet customer demand and also the regulatory compliance through the success of our EcoBoost engines, but also our plans for electrification in the region. And the diesel engines that we have, meet the stringent Stage VI requirements. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay, let's move on to Middle East and Africa. And here the story is basically one word, it's volume. The volume is affecting every metric that you can see here on the page. Decline in volume the industry in which we participate, that excludes primarily Iran as the major market that we don't participate in. You can see that SAAR was down 12%. We've also seen lower market share. That's primarily in the Middle East where we've had some performance issues and also we had adverse market mix. So volume is the story in terms of the metrics. And Middle East and Africa and if you go to the following slide, you can see that very, very clearly here the causal factor slide, $124 million more than explained by the volume decline. You can see across the rest of the business the team has done a great job of managing pricing, keeping that flat. And cost performance has been favorable and we're seeing some good news on the exchange and that's related to the South African rand. For the full year, we continue to expect Middle East and Africa to improve compared with 2016 and that's going to be driven by lower cost and favorable exchange with lower volume being a partial offset. We do expect that the year-over-year improvement will largely be realized in the second half of the year. If we move on now to Asia-Pacific, and Asia-Pacific is actually a two story, so there is a China story and there is a story in the rest of the region. China, this was a challenging quarter. You can see the industry was down 1.6 million units, which more than explain the decline in the overall region. This was the effective payback into the fourth quarter from the stronger fourth quarter performance related to customer expectation that the purchase tax incentive would be eliminated at the end of the year, as it turned out only half of it was, but clearly had an effect on the industry. It had an effect on us. Our share is down and that was largely around the units that were most affected by that purchase tax incentive that was the escort and the focus. And when you look at our JVs, you can see it affected them as well. We are under good profit of $274 million on a net basis with a margin of 13%, but that was down on a full-year basis. The other part of the story is around the rest of the region. The rest of the region was profitable, every market other than India was profitable. And every market including India improved on a year-over-year basis. If we got to the next slide and look at the factors behind the change in Asia-Pacific largely driven by what happened in China, and you can see that with the net pricing that's the negative industry pricing in China. The volume effect. And then you can see we're able to hold cost flat and a bit of exchange that was more than explained by the weakness of the renminbi. For the full year we continue to expect to be profitable in Asia-Pacific and to actually improve versus 2016. And that's going to be due to higher volume, we believe, we'll see recovery of volume in the balance of the year. We expect cost to be about flat. We will continue to see negative net pricing and we do expect to see adverse exchange related to the weaker renminbi. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: And as Bob mentioned, obviously the China tax incentive change drove a pull ahead in sales of cars obviously with the smaller than the 1.6 liter engines into the fourth quarter of last year. But there is no doubt we faced higher competition, and also our own market performance issues in China. And we've taken actions to respond, and that includes changes in our go-to-market plan. And we do expect to return to growth in China from the second quarter onwards through the balance of the year as both the industry strengthens and our go-to-market changes take effect in the marketplace. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Let's move into Ford Credit. There has been a lot of concern, lot of articles written, lot of papers written over auto financing in the broadest sense of the word, and we've actually been talking about that for a year. All I can tell you is that we feel like we're in a really good place with Ford Credit and with Ford, based on what we see today, what we know today, and how we've kind of factored that into our outlook. If you look at the metrics here, you can see on the second set of data there that the business grew, managed receivables were up 6%, pre-tax results fell only 6% to $481 million. When you look at some of the portfolio metrics, the next three sets of data, the FICO score is very, very strong at 741, that's on average. You can see delinquencies are up a bit, but still below the historical experience that we've had, but it's moving up, it's still not even at that level. And then in terms of the loss-to-receivables, it's approaching historical performance, but still at a very healthy level. So the portfolio is performing as we had expected in the environment that we had expected. And that's because the team continues to follow the same tried and true disciplined and consistent practices around servicing and origination that we've been following for many, many years. If you go to the following slide and you look at the decline of $33 million of profitability and look at the very middle, it's around the lease residuals. And that's the supplemental depreciation that the team has taken in response to what we have seen in terms of auction values. The rest of the factors on a net basis actually improved, driven by the favorable volume and mix of the business on a global basis. So nothing this year that to us is a surprise or was unexpected. If you go to the following slide, looking at financing trends, again everything in line with our expectations. If you look at the upper left in terms of our lease share as a percent of retail sales, you can see that both the industry and ourselves are beginning to pull back, if you compare that back to the first quarter of 2016. We continue to track below the industry, largely because of our product mix. If you look at auction values in the upper right, we actually saw a sequential improvement in auction values, that's seasonality. If you look at the 2017 first quarter versus 2016 first quarter, that's a 7% decline in auction values. That's consistent with the industry. Our view for the full year is that it will be about 6% on average. So you'll see ups \u2013 different factors by quarter point-to-point, but on average about 6%. And everything we see says that we're on track for that. On the lower left, everything looks good in terms of what we're seeing relative to reposition ratios and severity. And we've already covered the LTRs in the lower right. So again, everything is very much in line with our expectations. And then on the next slide, we just tried to capture everything that we've been looking at and everything we've been reading about in terms of concerns and trends around the financing industry. And our view is that both Ford and Ford Credit's outlooks have incorporated these industry trends appropriate. And as a result Ford Credit itself is on track for the profit that we've guided to for the full year of $1.5 billion with an expectation that the results will improve in 2018 as a result of less supplemental depreciation. If we go to the following slide, which is slide 29. So this is around cash flow, so solid performance on cash flow. If you look at the first \u2013 maybe the fourth line there I guess. Automotive segment pre-tax profit at $2 billion, it basically flowed right through to the operating cash flow. So the negative net spend was completely offset by the combination of the working capital and the timing differences. If you look at the capital spending of $1.7 billion, it suggests to us that we're on track to the full year guidance of $7 billion. If you go further down the page, you can see the changes in debt, $200 million. That is just us making normal debt repayments. The pension contributions in the quarter of $200 million, that's in line with our full year plan of $1 billion, no change there. And in terms of the shareholder distributions, Mark mentioned that. That's in line with our plan for the year of $2.7 billion. And then finally for me on the balance sheet, very simply put, auto cash liquidity balance is strong. So Automotive is looking strong, Ford Credit is looking strong, well-capitalized, strong liquidity. And when we go down and look at the pensions, everything that we're seeing right now relative to asset returns, discount rates, our plan contributions would suggest that our funded status at the end of the year should improve compared with the end of last year. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Thanks, Bob. So since our last discussion, we've updated some of our expectations for the full year industry sales for all the major markets. So if we look at the new news here on slide 31, it's really within the industry. And we now expect Brazil to be slightly higher in 2017. And that reflects, as Bob mentioned, better performance from the fleet sector. In Europe, we expect industry volume to be slightly higher compared to our prior guidance in 2017 and 2018. And that really reflects gains across most of the EU 20 markets with the exception of the UK. And then turning to China, we expect the industry volume to be higher at 28.2 million units in 2017 and then flat in 2018. And that really reflects the positive economic momentum that we've seen in the first quarter. Just a note, we continue to expect the U.S. to decline slightly this year but remaining at a historically high level. On slide 32, our 2017 company outlook continues to be consistent with the previous guidance. And then turning to our business unit guidance on slide 33, you can see our latest assessment of what we call puts and takes for each of the regions or segments, compared to the results from a year ago. And while our guidance remains unchanged, we are seeing a significant increase in headwinds from higher commodities. And that's mainly steel. But we see it across most commodity groups. And as I mentioned earlier, we're increasing our efforts to deliver greater cost efficiencies across all parts of the business to mitigate this headwind and, of course, further improve the fitness of our overall business. Turning to slide 34, again we expect total company adjusted pre-tax profit this year to be about $9 billion. And that sets up a platform for a stronger result in 2018. We do expect this improvement to be led by gains in our core business, and that's thanks to the full-year availability of important new high margin vehicles like the Navigator and the Expedition. But we also expect F-Series to continue to perform well in the market. As Bob mentioned, we also anticipate Ford Credit to benefit from lower supplemental depreciation. And at the same time we'll continue to invest in the emerging opportunities that will drive not only future growth for the company, but profitability as well. So putting it all together on slide 35, we delivered a solid quarter. And again we continue to expect to deliver another good year for this year in line with our previous guidance. And then just wrapping it up on slide 36 before we open it up for Q&A. We have a very clear vision and strategy for our business going forward. We remain fully focused on the strategic priorities that will drive value as we continue our expansion to an auto and a mobility company. We're focused on fortifying our core strengths, transforming the underperforming parts of our business, and investing aggressively, but also prudently, in emerging opportunities. And I believe that we're already well along the process of transforming our business from a business that's a strong, healthy automotive company to one that will be even stronger and bigger going forward. And as usual we look forward to sharing with you our progress throughout the year. And with that I'd like to have my colleagues join me. And we can take any questions that you might have. Operator : As a reminder, we will take calls from the investment community first, followed by questions from the news media. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Colin Langan of UBS. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Actually talking about the last slide, you talk about transform and the focus on luxury, small car and emerging opportunities. Can you give any color on what is the timeline for getting those on track and fixed? In particular there has been a lot of chatter around small cars, those may be possibly losing money. And any plans how could you get those back to profitability? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Colin, it's Mark. And as you said, we're going to stay very focused on our strategy of fortify, transform and grow. As you think of the transform areas, listen, in some of these cases we've said it's a journey and we want to show continual improvement. And if you look at each one of those areas, if you look at luxury, we've talked about not only the sales growth that we've had with Lincoln. But if you look at what I call the hygiene factors of the brand in terms of how the brand is viewed, in terms of customers set, both on the service and sales end, both here in the U.S. and in China, we made a lot of progress. We've announced the localization of production of our Lincoln SUV in China which is going to help the profitability. So we're seeing, we have very clear metrics around this, we're on plan and as we said, going back to our Investor Day, we want to make sure that our sales success is matched with financial success with Lincoln and we're in the process of making improvements on that journey. In the case of small vehicles, again we've talked about some of the key elements that drive small vehicle profitability, reducing complexity and we've talked about how we significantly reduce complexity of vehicles like our Focus and Fiesta and continue that going forward with the next models. We've talked about low cost production and we've been very clear in moving our production here in North America for our small vehicles to low-cost areas, and even in the case of Europe with the launch of EcoSport in Romania. So we're going to continue to make progress on that, and show you the proof-points along the way. And then finally, in emerging markets, obviously last year we took actions to exit some markets and also to close our plant in Australia, which is one of the reasons, as Bob mentioned, outside of China, our operations are profitable, including Australia. And we've said we're in the process of examining our strategy in India, and when we have something to talk about, we will. But we will continue to work this, and keep you apprised. Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Actually on your last point, that was one of the more interesting comments when Bob's going through his question \u2013 commentary. So when we look at Asia Pac, we take out China, it's losing about a $150 million, but everything except India is actually making money. So is India really losing? Is that the pace and what can you do to kind of address that? Or is there other factors in that $150 million loss that I'm not thinking about? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, let me \u2013 just to be clear, first of all, China made money in the quarter, and you have to remember that China has a number of different components, it's the JVs, it's Lincoln, it's the imported Ford brand, it's also charges that we hold centrally like around engineering that we're incurring today that would be compensated for in the future through royalties from the JVs. So China made money. Outside of China, we made money. In fact the only major market that didn't make money was India, and India improved. So, we saw improvement everywhere through the region outside of China, and we're profitable. So, it was, if you will, both sides of the equation were working for us in terms of profitability in the region. But yeah, as we talked about, China was a challenge in this market. I mentioned, we do expect and are restarting to see signs of that improvement both in terms of the overall market but around performance as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino of Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thank you for taking our questions this morning. I think the first one I want to harp on is we've seen a lot of the bank's earnings so far this year and \u2013 or this quarter, and most of them talk about pulling back on their auto loan profiles. So it seems as if credit is somewhat tightening from that perspective. Do you anticipate or do you expect to grow your asset base within Ford Motor Credit as you might see a little bit more challenging times for customers being able to get loans from your third-party partners or from other lenders? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, let me comment first and then I'll turn it over to Marion, CFO at Ford Credit, if he has anything he wants to add. But we are growing. I mean, you saw that in the first quarter. We would expect to see growth for the full year. It's not just here but it's around the world. And I think you also have to remember what the role of Ford Credit is. For the role of Ford Credit in Ford is to be there, good times, bad times, I mean that's why the practices that we follow around origination and servicing. We've been through the good and the bad and we know how to manage the business appropriately in either condition, which is why we believe that we were ahead of recognizing some of these factors that are now being written about so much across the region. But we think that we will grow over the balance of the year and we think that it will grow in a way that's very healthy and supportive of the overall business. Marion, do you want to add anything? Marion B. Harris - Ford Motor Co.: Sure, Bob. The growth is much around the world as it is in the U.S. And with plateauing sales in the U.S., our growth in receivables here is really not that large. And for all the \u2013 although we've seen written about in the press, we have seen a number of banks start to pull away from deep sub-prime lending or longer-term financing, but it's really at a plateauing kind of level. And so we haven't seen a real retrenchment yet. And as Bob said, this is the value of a captive to ensure that we're able to support Ford when banks come and go. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And just following up on that, is there a specific total asset base or total level that you'd get up to or maybe you'd stop yourself at? Marion B. Harris - Ford Motor Co.: We haven't guided on a number like that, we wouldn't expect it to continue to grow. But with North American volumes plateauing, we don't expect dramatic growth. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you. And just my second question. So I look at the European profit segment, it look like incentives were much more of a headwind this year or this quarter than it was previously and net pricing was down year-over-year. But on slide 33, you are effectively looking for the full year to see a positive net pricing. So I'm just wondering, what you're expecting in the back half of the year or even in the second quarter onward from a pricing perspective within that region? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: When you look at our European business, obviously the net pricing that we have was taken away by incentives and that's really where we are in the cycle of some of our product, some of our key products in Europe that are ageing. Maybe example I'll use is Fiesta, we're on run out on that right now and that represents 20% \u2013 25% of our volume in Europe. So we do expect is when we launch the vehicle and what I mentioned earlier around some of the new additions, in terms of the high-end that is \u2013 that's the physical, if you will, that will, you kind of flip the outlook for the remainder of the year once it's launched at the back-end of the second quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Good morning. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Had a couple of questions. First on Europe. How do you \u2013 just given the declines in diesel that we're seeing in the market broadly, I was wondering if you can share some perspective on how are you think companies are going to behave effectively, I think, that as a result of the CO2 emissions are basically moving backward, just given that diesels are more CO2 efficient. So is that something that is a risk for that region, this spending on equal (45:48) or other technologies need to accelerate versus the prior plan or do you think that the industry starts to incentivize diesel a little bit more to support demand? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I think a lot of that, around that, Rod, is also going to be based on what some of the tax regimes are in the various governments, but it's very clear, as you know, that both consumer sentiment and regulation are going to \u2013 we believe are going to continue to reduce diesel. And that's why I think we're well positioned for a couple of reasons. First off, what we're not seeing is we're not seeing diesel demand decrease in the commercial vehicle end of the business. And as you know, that is a very important piece of our business in Europe and from a profitability standpoint. At the same time, even though we're not seeing it, we are making the investments, which are in some of our emerging areas. As you know, we're going to be introducing a plug-in transit, hybrid transit in 2019 into the region. And as you get back to the passenger vehicle side, our belief is we're well positioned from a couple of different aspects. One, manufacturing flexibility. if people swing more back to obviously petrol engines, we have the capability to have that flexibility and we also have, as I mentioned in my comments, we built a very strong brand around EcoBoost engines. At the same time to your question of whether we have to spend more, I mean we are, we've laid out our electrification plan and then includes Europe. So I think, our plans to introduce not only a plug-in hybrid transit, but also some of the other vehicles that we've talked about will serve us well. And we'll have to see how the market behaves in terms of incentive spendings in the interim, I mean, you've seen a number of our competitors make a number of announcements of moving towards electrification et cetera. But I think either way, we'll be prepared for that. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And switching gears to China, I was hoping you can give us a sense of, the full year earnings expectation there, maybe you can define and quantify some of the key earnings drivers that are within your control and also what some of the factories you considered when \u2013 it looks like you are assuming flat demand into 2018. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I didn't (48:10) guide to China, we guided to the region. So in terms of the region, as I said, we expect to improve, we think that will be driven by higher volume that includes China. So that will be the industry that Mark talked about, we also believe and we are already seen it in the month of April that will \u2013 our own performance will pick up from where it had been in the first quarter. And that's against a backdrop of cost that we expect to be flat. They were actually flat as you saw in the quarter. We think, they will be flat for the full year, So that will be partially offset that by the pricing that we talked about and the exchange. But it will basically be around volume. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And just lastly, really quick, you mentioned U.S. auction values down about $1,150 year-over-year. Pricing in the new car market is not down to the same extent. And I was wondering if you could just kind of square that for us and from a consumer's perspective, obviously there is an impact on affordability, but are you seeing any effects on mix or is it basically volume pressure that's coming in as a result of that? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, as you saw in the quarter, we had favorable mix. I do think, in North America, when we look at the balance of the year that -well, hold onto the mix improvement that we've been getting over the last number of quarters, I don't think that you'll see that for the full year, I think, in terms of an improvement. I think, we'll see probably mix about flat, if not a little bit lower, because the comps obviously get tougher as you get into, but we had Super Duty in the second half of last year and so forth. So, I think, the mix improvement in North America on a year-over-year basis will probably end in the second half of the year. We do expect that we'll still see negative pricing in North America for the full year on a year-over-year basis. So we actually we're a bit positive in the quarter, but we've actually factored in some negative pricing in the second half of the year. And again, that's related to some of the timing of launches that we had last year, which helped us actually on that front. So, I think, we've factored in both an end of mix improvement year-over-year, we have factored in continued negative pricing other than the first quarter. And we've also factored in a lower industry. So we think that we've got a pretty good handle in terms of \u2013 I'll call it the cyclical pressures that you're talking about that are affecting the region. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. You previously communicated, I think, at your Investor Day that embedded in your 2017 guidance is an expectation for the Super Duty to be a year-on-year headwind to profits on increased cost to manufacturer, or higher amortization of tooling et cetera. At the same time, looking at your slide deck today, your ATP is on slide 16 are externally strong, and you're driving good mix benefits as shown on slide 15, that's not all Super Duty, I'm sure But I'm curious, if \u2013 and my question is, if maybe the price and the mix benefit of this vehicle might be outperforming your expectations, and how that is netting out against the cost of the vehicle relative to your expectations? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, I would say that's a good observation, I would say that everything is coming out better than what we had expected, not just on Super Duty but F-150. The volumes are stronger, we have grown share, the pricing has been better, the mix has been stronger, we've actually seen some favorable performance on cost. So I think everything right across the board on the whole Super Duty lineup has been good. Of course we've got \u2013 diesel is coming in as well. So that's going to be another better and ahead of F-Series in terms of what we can do to attract consumers in the segment. So I agree with you, everything is better than what we had expected when we talked about that about a year or so ago. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: And I would just reemphasize, this is another example of how we are fortifying the profit pillars, because when you look -Bob mentioned our overall F-Series performance and not only were our transaction prices up significantly and much more than the competition, but our share of the segment, our share of the full-sized segment is over 38% now. So it's up over a 1.5 point in the first quarter. So customers are really seeing the value and the capability that we've made and the investments and the aluminum body and the high-strength steel frame. And we're not resting on our laurels. We know we have the updated the freshened F-150 coming in the fall of this year, then we have the Ranger coming, et cetera. We're going to continue to reinforce this profit pillar and as I've talked about in the past kind of build out our moats around this because it's such an important part of our business. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's great to hear. Thanks. And then just lastly for me, probing the implications of GM's exit from Europe. Firstly, is the sale of Opel/Vauxhall to PSA a threat because it makes a stronger competitor with more scale or is it instead maybe an opportunity because it removes weaker competitor that was maybe competing on price? And then secondly, I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're committed to your operations in Europe and of course you had a really great 2016 there. But can you just sort of summarize for the investors what you think are maybe the biggest differences between your European operations and GMs such that staying in Europe is the right thing for you to do, for your shareholders, even if leaving was the right thing for theirs? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, again, I'll just talk to Ford. In the case of the PSA purchase of Opel, I think the answer to your first part of your question is yes in that I think there is some opportunities, particularly near-term opportunities and we're actually seeing that in the marketplace right , in terms of share and things of that nature. I also think, longer term it does take out one more competitor. At the same time, we have a bigger competitor. And I think we're factoring that into our plans. In terms of Europe, as we go forward, I won't kind of do a comparison. But I think from our standpoint, our business, we have \u2013 we're going to stay focused as I mentioned on that strategy of product, brand and cost. And importantly, our strategy in Europe is really to play to our strengths. Commercial vehicles, utilities which we've grown a lot and where the market is moving, one out of every Ford vehicles on the passenger side, part of the market in Europe last quarter was SUVs and performance vehicles. And as we do that, we can leverage kind of our global scale and technology at the same time, as we go into not only improving our petrol engines, but electrification and diesel. And the other element that's different is, remember, we decided to stay in Russia. And you heard from Bob, we're seeing improvement in that Russia business. So this is where we take a point of view on the future, we put a plan together, it starting to bear fruit and its' helping our European business. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks a lot. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Galliers of Evercore ISI. George Galliers - Evercore ISI : Yeah. Good morning, guys. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Good morning. George Galliers - Evercore ISI : Just following on from Rod's questions around diesel. I was wondering if you could give any indication of your exposure to diesel of residual values in Europe, and have you made any adjustment to those given declining share changes in consumer sentiments and clearly political risk? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, in terms of lease, I think we actually provided some data on that at the last chat event back in March. We actually do almost no leasing in Europe. And so from that regard, which is a different than some of the competitors that we're up against in Europe, so from that regard, there is no lease exposure relative to residuals. If you think about just the overall market in terms of residual values, I mean that would, depending upon how that plays out as Mark was talking about, I think that would be impacted, would be an industry effect that we would have to deal with as it happens. But it wouldn't be an impact that would affect leasing, because we don't do that to any significant degree in Europe. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: The only other think I'd add, George, is when you look at \u2013 and I mentioned our mix in Europe is about 45% diesels, which is about a point or two below the industry. But if you look at the UK, which is our largest market, represents 30% of our sales, our diesel mix is somewhere in the neighborhood of around 35%. And that's just due to the mix of our products, right. We're selling more SUVs, more larger vehicles, and so we're \u2013 I think we're \u2013 it's an important market for us and we're below the rest of the industry. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, another thing too is that it'll be interesting to see how this plays out. But if there is that kind of shift, you would think it would also start to give you a bounce on, in terms of the residual values of the petrol vehicle, because of the consumer movement into that and the demand for the petrols relative to diesels. So it's not just one way. George Galliers - Evercore ISI : Okay. Great. And just to be clear, and I probably should know the answer to this, you're not underlying on your retail products on this sort of trade cycle management product with respect to minimum future guaranteed values of the Ford Credit (57:18) on the diesel? Marion B. Harris - Ford Motor Co.: We are, George, but it's at a significantly lower level than what projected residual would be. It's a trade cycle management product in Europe and it's more like a balloon where a customer does have the ability to turn back in a vehicle, but this \u2013 the product is structured with a deep equity position. George Galliers - Evercore ISI : Okay. Great. And then the second question I just had was sort of bit of housekeeping. In the deck you gave distributions for this year of $2.7 billion, I thinking on the Detroit deck it was $2.8 billion. Is the difference related to some of the anti dilutive buyback? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, I finally found something good about lower share price and that's the fact that the cost of the anti dilutive share repurchase program isn't as great as what we had thought. George Galliers - Evercore ISI : Okay. Thank you. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: (58:14). Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, let's be clear be on that. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: That's the only thing good. George Galliers - Evercore ISI : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, George. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Morning, John. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Just have three quick ones here. First, as raw material costs go up, is there an opportunity to potentially share that with some of your partners, namely your suppliers, if that becomes a real headwind? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, the way that we structure our interactions with the supply base on commodities, it's a number of things. Steel is contract, right. So I'm sure that our purchasing organization is negotiating as hard as they possibly can in terms of those contracts to make sure that we get the best price that we possibly can. If you look at many of the other commodities though, we actually index. And so as a result of that, I think that's probably one of the reasons why when commodities are falling, we tend to get a much faster and quicker improvement, because it will flow through to us relatively quickly from the indexing. I think the converse is true when prices start to go up. So I think the team actually is working though with the supply (59:33) the amount of various commodities that we have on our components and then the suppliers' components that they are working on that. The other thing that I would mention is that we do some hedging. And so there is some protection for hedging. So in fact at this point in time about half of our full year exposure is already locked in through the combination of contracts as well as hedges. The other thing that's interesting about the commodities is there is actually a correlation of some commodities with some of our currencies. And so what we'll see is while there might be bad news on a particular commodity, often times it's going to be offset by good news on a particular currency. Australian dollars are really a good example of that. So you can't just look at the one factor. It's actually something that we look at across both exchange exposures as well as commodity exposures. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's helpful. And just a second question on cash conservation or I mean really your cash balance is a little bit higher. Then I think you've talked about it in the past. I mean at this point in the cycle, are you just going to let the cash build up on the balance sheet and really just be set to take advantage of opportunities and to be incredibly cushioned in case we do go into a downturn sooner rather than later? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yes. Let me make a number of comments. So as Mark mentioned, we're not uncomfortable at all with the fact that we have a lot of liquidity at this point in the cycle. But I want to remind you, John, that about $3 billion of that is related to the debt issuance that we had back in December, which was very specifically for \u2013 to give us the capital that we could use at some point in the future to support both the core business and the emerging opportunities around strategic opportunities, whether it's equity into something, purchase of something. As Mark said, we're going to look at that very prudently. And it has to be completely consistent with our strategic framework and our objectives. But that $3 billion of that is for that. So think about the rest of it is around $25 billion, which is still above our minimum cash of $20 billion. So we think that that's not a bad place to be at this point in the cycle, but also depending upon our results, it gives us the ability to provide a very nice supplemental dividend, which was the other means that we'll use to provide distributions to shareholders above and beyond the regular dividend. So we'll have to see how the performance comes out in terms of the year relative to net income, but that's the other way that we would utilize that, consistent with our strategy on the supplemental dividend. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : That's helpful. And then just lastly, and I hate to ask a question like this in this forum. But I mean on cadence of earnings, traditionally you guys have been around 60%, 40% first half, second half. This \u2013 the way you're talking about the guidance per region as you went through your comments kind of like indicates that the second half might be equal to or maybe even a little bit stronger than the first half. I just wondered if you can give us some color there, because it looks like estimates are still looking for the first half to be a bit stronger than the second half. And it sounds like your commentary is more equal weighted to maybe even a little backend loaded? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: My least favorite subject is calendarization, it's like trying to grab Jell-O. So the third quarter will be the weakest absolute of the year, so I can say that with some confidence. I think in terms of first half, second half, probably the historical experience is more or less right, probably 55%, 60% somewhere in that range, would be about right. But I have a big asterisk beside anything I say with calendarization. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Okay. We'll make our estimates. Thank you very much. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question comes from the line Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Grabbing Jell-O, I like that one, Bob. Mark, Continental in their Powertrain Capital Markets Day a couple days ago said that they are engineering what they see as their last generation internal combustion powertrain to be launched in 2023. Do you agree with that kind of spirit that this is the last generation of ICE? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I can't speak to Continental. I did see Elmar [Degenhart] and what they laid out in their plans, how they were going to spend their capital. Listen, our view very, very simply and you've heard us, that in the next 15 years we expect in the industry there to be more electrified options in the marketplace than ICE ones. And electrified being hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and full BEV. At the same time, there will still be a market for ICE engines. Part of that is due to the job to be done and the duty cycles for things like truck applications or heavyweight applications or climatic applications. And our view is that over time the cost of ownership of an internal combustion engine is going to cross with an electrified. They'll probably do it first for hybrids, then for plug-ins, and then after that somewhere down the road in BEVs. And that's going to be a combination of improvements that we see in the technology and the scale and also the infrastructure for electrification. And on the other hand you're going to see costs go up on the ICE side of the house because of regulations. So that's why we're making the investments. But I can't speak to individual suppliers, but I do believe that there will be some portion of this industry where ICE applications will be very appropriate, plus at the same time, the world is not sitting still in terms of the technological advances in ICE engines. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Plus, the hybrid and the plug-in hybrid includes an ICE. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Right. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. Got it. And Mark, you actually kind of brought up my second question, which is when do you see that crossover occurring? I mean you guys are obviously doing a ton of work on this space and you have your own assessments and experiences of the sell cost at the pack level, et cetera. When do you see that for , let's say the average application of a pure EV, forget hybrid for a second, but pure EV, being the lower cost to ownership than an ICE, whether it has \u2013 whether it's a hybrid or not? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, we haven't \u2013 we haven't really talked about that, because there's lots of moving parts on that. But I still think that's a ways away. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: I still think that that is a ways away, and as I said, I think it will happen first for hybrids and then plug-ins, BEVs they're still \u2013 when you look at the cost per kilowatt hour and some of the advances that have to be made, I still think that's we're ways away on that. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And my last question on cars. There's this old adage out there that, it doesn't matter what happens to car sales, because car companies make all their money in trucks and SUVs. But my understanding was that you, Ford in particular, relative to your U.S. domestic peers used to make some really good money in passenger cars through your global platform architecture and the right product, the right place and EcoBoost and that was a different environment perhaps in hindsight 2020. But I just want to understand, is that true that you used to make good money in cars and does this mean that the segment shift that's under \u2013 that the industry is going through, we kind of have a shunning of cars, if you will, whether it's cyclical or secular that you have to kind of overcome those decrementals with something else, yeah? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I'd actually turn that around and say the industry shift that we're seeing around the world from cars and SUVs plays to our strengths. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. But that's not to say, I mean again I know you don't disclose profitability on a model line basis, but you \u2013 are you able to say, are you able to comment on \u2013 on and directionally whether that is accurate that you had have been making positive \u2013 that you had have been making positive profit on the cars throughout much of the cycle? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I'm not going to comment on our past profitability around cars or any of our vehicle lines. But we obviously want to make sure that as we go forward, we're allocating our capital to those areas that are going to drive value in the company. And that's why I think when you look at how we're doing that in some of the examples we talked about earlier, plus the segmentation around the world, it's going to play to our strengths, Adam. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson of Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Good morning. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Good morning, Brian. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Two questions, one about for Ford Credit and just a kind of broad strategic question. The first question on Ford Credit, okay 7% auction declines year-over-year, couple of kind of sub-questions around that. As you look \u2013 first as you look forward through the remainder of 2017 and since two-thirds of your lease book almost by definition is in the out years, what sort of auction declines are you keeping and has it that already been factored into the supplemental depreciation or if we see further weakening on a \u2013 further weakening, will there be more sequential depreciation that's going to be needed? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: So Brian, what I would say is that as we've mentioned already, we're expecting an average decline of 6% this year. We also have assumed and we haven't provided nor will we today, further declines in the forward years. So we are writing new contracts, if you will, on the assumption of those lower declines. So we believe that we've called that right that we have factored in what is going to happen over the next several years and have that reflected appropriately, and the books that \u2013 what's going on the book today. That would not be supplemental depreciation. I mean that's us just writing the contracts at the right level, look at the right return. It would mean, for example, if those were lease vehicles, that the leasing expense will be more expensive for Ford Credit. They can either pass it along, they absorb it in favorable marketing, but we think that we've called that right and that's how we've set up the business. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I guess my question just in the weeds was, if you had a 1Q 2016 origination and that car is not going come back till 1Q 2019, what have you assumed, have you taken the hit that you think you're going to get in 2019 now or do you have to wait till ALG walks those guidelines down? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: No, we don't take any hit, because you basically have written the contract with the assumption that that is the lower and have a lower value. Obviously, that means if the Ford Motor Company in terms of what it may have to do in terms of subvention and so forth could be more expensive than in the past, but let me have Marion just add or supplement if you want to. Marion B. Harris - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, so you have to \u2013 it's complicated, you have to understand the accounting around this. But in your example if a contract had been written in the first quarter of 2016 and ALG, 2016. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: 2016, sorry. Marion B. Harris - Ford Motor Co.: So if a contract had been written in the first quarter of 2016 and ALG has subsequently lowered their outlook on that, we immediately start to take supplemental depreciation for that. So we're taking a substantial amount of supplemental depreciation this year, as we talked about at the Let's Chat event, we took a lot in 2016 and we took our first cut of the \u2013 bite of the apple beginning in 2016 and then second cut of the apple at end of 2016, so we're taking more supplemental depreciation in 2017 than we did in 2016. And that is for the entire portfolio all the way out through 2018, 2019 and into 2020. And it's completely contained within our outlook. And that's why we're \u2013 we've guided that we expect our 2018 results to improve from 2017, as we would expect to have lower supplemental depreciation. We've factored those sequential declines into our outlook and it's rolling through our accounting today. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: And Brian, I just wanted to \u2013 just to reconfirm though that for new contracts, not only have we obviously assumed what would expect to happen this year, but we have further assumed declines post 2017 and that should add into the new business that we're writing. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, great. Second question for Mark. There is an automaker who makes about a 100,000 Runway Cars a year, who is valued higher than Ford or roughly the same. We can debate the valuation of that company, but in terms of your investments, whether it's big data, autonomy, mobility, electrification, what do you think the market is missing in that comparison? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well again, I can't speak to Tesla, I know you didn't mention the name, but I know that's what you are referring to. And we're just going to stay focused on our strategy. First off, I just want to say on the valuation, we're absolutely committed to making sure that we create value for our shareholders and as we execute the strategy of fortifying our profit pillars and transforming the underperforming parts of the our business and growing in the emerging opportunities, that I'm confident that we're going to create value and we will continue to return value to our shareholders. In terms of maybe what the market is missing, in terms of you look at the valuation of our business, and I will \u2013 first off, I think we have a robust and defensible core and you've heard this morning how we're fortifying the efforts around that. The cost structure that we've put into the business and also the strong balance sheet allows us to pay a nice sustainable dividend, which by the way has a nice yield. And I think the upside around as we transform the underperforming parts of our business and grow in the emerging areas. And I think on the growing in the emerging areas, and you mentioned them, mobility and data and autonomous vehicles and connectivity, I think we need to do a better job as a company in dimensioning what that means for us in the future in terms of revenue and profit growth. We have talked about the investments and we will do that going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Whiston of Morningstar. David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thanks, good morning. ALG had said yesterday they are looking for industry incentive spending to peak in July and I was just curious, if you are that optimistic or do you think the industry might continue to remain somewhat irrational, but keep the SAAR above 17%? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I don't think, the industry has been rationale, let me just say that first. If you see what's happening, there has been a very, very slow, long, progressive increase in incentives, going all the way back from when the downturn ended. So we are just on that track. We have so far seen the ATPs continue to stay ahead of that. So that's inclusive of that. So I don't \u2013 and I don't see any particular manufacturer on a consistent basis doing something that I would think is unhealthy for the business. I think everyone is very much focused on margins, profitability. Does anybody in any particular month or quarter maybe try to address an inventory situation or gain a taxable advantage, yes, sure that happens. But I have not seen that in terms of a consistent approach to the business. So I think overall the industry is relatively disciplined. Mark talked about what we are doing. We are going to continue to do what we are doing. I am not aware of anything that would suggest that that trend of small increases, progressive increases is going to end. David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Justine Fisher of Goldman Sachs. Justine Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Good morning. Justine Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.: The first question that I have is just following up on two questions that go in terms of the outlook for used values in 2018 and 2019. I know, Bob, you said that you guys weren't going to put specific numbers around your expectations in 2018 and 2019. But we do know that the off lease vehicle supply increases significantly in 2018 and 2019. So could you give us color as to whether you expect the declines to accelerate or decelerate year-over-year in 2018 versus 2017? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, we expect the declines to continue and it's actually \u2013 we have factored in exactly what you referenced, which is the fact that we know how much is going to be coming back as we know what's been leased. And so we've factored that into our thinking. So we do see a continued decline, but I don't want to get into any characterization of the slope of that decline. Justine Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks. And then the second question is following up on something that we talked about at the Let's Chat. You mentioned that you expected lower used vehicle prices to manifest themselves more in new vehicle volume than in new vehicle price, i.e., that the OEMs would cut production instead of just lower their prices on new cars. So, can you give us color on what the size of that price insensitive market is, i.e., how much would vehicle production has to go down in order to shrink the consumer-base to that population that will still buy a new car with trim and features even if used car prices have \u2013 are down? Have you guys done work on that? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: My head just exploded from that question, but (01:17:19). Let me just explain how we think about it in my very simple way of thinking. So the reality is that, first of all, people that buy used vehicles tend to be people that buy used vehicles, people that tend to buy new, tend to buy new. So there is some sort of area where maybe people will flip back and forth between the two, but they actually tend to be quite separate consumer sets. Second thing I would say is that, clearly with lower used vehicle values, it's going to have an effect on the ability to price for new. It will put tension on that because of residual values and so forth. So it may affect mix, you may find people that start to move down series or even down from segments, potentially while staying in new so there could be an affect there. It could affect variable marketing, because again what we talked about earlier around subvention cost. So there's so many different impacts that could take place. The way that we have generally and largely expressed that as our view of just lower volume, and so that's one of the key factors that is behind our view that the industry will decline this year from last year, and will decline in 2018 from 2017. Now, it may play out a little bit differently than that, but the thing that is interesting so far is that what we've seen today would suggest that that is what's taking place right now. I don't know if Mark wants to add anything. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: One other thing when you look at the data, Bob mentioned the small overlap between new car buyers that buy used and vice versa. When you dig into the data, actually the segments that are a little bit indexed a little higher are cars, and it's mainly compact and midsize cars where you see that. So you could see that manifest itself from the volume side of the house on the car side of the industry. Justine Fisher - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Thanks so much. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: You bet. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin of The Associated Press. Dee-Ann Durbin - The Associated Press : Hi. Thank you for taking the call. Good morning. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Good morning, Dee-Ann. Dee-Ann Durbin - The Associated Press : I just wanted you to talk really briefly about recall costs that hit you in the third quarter, that hit you again. What are you doing to improve quality or tackle on these kind of recurring big, huge costs? Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Well, first off, Dee-Ann thanks for the question and obviously, we are absolutely committed to making sure that we provide top quality to our customers. And when you look at some of the work that we're doing, we're doing a lot of work obviously in making sure the initial quality of our vehicles is very good, because that gives you an indication to the long-term quality. And whether it's our own internal measurements that we have but also external J.D. Power and others, it shows we're making very good progress along those ways. At the same time, one of the reasons you see when we do have, in some cases a recall and it's fairly large, remember we were a little bit ahead of the industry in terms of reducing our platforms and getting more commonality of parts across our vehicle lines. And so when there is an issue, whether it's our own issue or whether a supplier, it intends to hit a bigger population. And as usual, whenever we see something from a quality standpoint, we are going to act very proactively to fix that for the customer. And that's exactly what we are going to continue to do. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: And Dee-Ann, if I could just add to that, just maybe to help to understanding. So what we do in terms of cost related to quality, I'll say, is we actually reserve with every single vehicle sold a certain amount for coverages. So that's the three-years, 36,000 miles, if you will. But we also reserve for every single vehicle we sell an amount that goes into a reserve for what we call field service actions, which are recalls. So we reserve for that. So what happens though is that if we get a particularly large recall that comes through that is above and beyond what we can manage within that reserve, and then effectively it forces us to let it flow through the bottom line more or less, and then we've got to \u2013 top up the reserve back to the level that's \u2013 we've \u2013 we've developed a minimum level that we have to have, and we have to go back up to that minimum. So a lot of recalls you never hear about, because it's covered by the reserve. It's these sort of big, one-time, large ones and driven apart for the factors that Mark mentioned that force us to handle it on more of a flow right through the bottom line basis. Dee-Ann Durbin - The Associated Press : Okay. Thanks so much. I appreciate it. Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks Dee-Ann. Operator : That does conclude the question-and-answer portion of the call. I will now turn the call back over to Ted Cannis for any additional or closing remarks. Ted Cannis - Ford Motor Company : All right. Thank you very much for participating in today's call, and we look forward to the next one. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Operator : This concludes the Ford Motor Company earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

Christiaan Hetzner - Automotive News Matthew DeBord - Business Insider Operator : Good morning. My name is Dorothy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford Motor Company Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ted Cannis, Director of Investor Relations with Ford Motor Company. Please go ahead, sir. Ted Cannis - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks very much, Dorothy. Good morning and welcome everybody to Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2017 earnings review. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are John Lawler, Vice President and Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President, Corporate Treasurer and CFO of Ford Smart Mobility; and Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Marion Harris, Ford Credit CFO. The results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix. Today's discussion also includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance. As you know, actual results may vary. As a reminder, copies of the Ford and Ford Credit's second quarter earnings presentations and press releases are available on Ford's investor and media websites. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jim. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, Ted, and thank you for joining our call today. You know, success for me today is to start my first call as CEO of Ford Motor Company to assert two important points as a baseline. The first; Ford is a fantastic company with not only an incredible history, but I think a very bright future. And you know, I've had time leading another business in another industry, and during that time, I often traveled to Silicon Valley. It was so frequent that I did learn and understand the culture there. In fact, it's steeped into my thinking, optimism, innovation and questioning the status quo. Out there, being a young company is cool. And in this realm, a company that is 114 days old is a hot item. But what I also learned from all these experiences is that a company that has lasted 114 years is rare, and it doesn't get there by luck, decree, or sticking with the status quo, rather in the face of the facts that fewer than one in five startups succeed, a company that has persisted 114 years, well it had to remake itself many times. When war engulfed the world or when gasoline was 100 times more expensive than when the industry started or when a pickup truck was reimagined to yield one of the largest collective gasoline savings in the car inventory park today. In this way, Ford Motor Company is a jewel in the eyes of those who study long-lived businesses. In the eyes of our customers, who've seen us evolve, trust us and they love the Ford brand. The second point starts with the humble underpinning that Ford can be a much better company. We have an opportunity to be extraordinary in the way we relate to and deliver value to our customers. And in this way, we can deliver much more value of course to our shareholders. And I'd like to briefly update you on how we're approaching the work in the first 100 days. In some of the earliest thinking, as we develop our compelling strategy and plan, and you'll hear a reference that we're going to be coming back to you in the fall with more details on that strategy and plan. Now with the slides, you'll see graphics here that support my comments, and I'm sure you're familiar with the fortify, transform, and grow strategic framework that was articulated over the past 12 months or so, and that's on the right side of the slide. What we're doing as a team in my first 100 days is unpacking that on the right with fresh eyes, and we focused on a few early priorities. Let me identify those for you. Initially, we evaluated how to maximize revenue opportunities. As you hear, there is a leveling in the business. So by utilizing data modeling, we identified sweet spots between volume, mix, and price to help deliver higher transaction prices in an increasingly competitive market. We're also evaluating and improving the fitness of the company. Now I've been talking about this concept of fitness, and of course, it includes cost, but it really involves taking a much deeper system or holistic view of all parts of the business to ensure that we're really as fit as we need to be to compete and win, and win, I want to emphasize that. We're also evaluating capital deployment opportunities, something I've heard from many of you, and we know, we're going to be quicker and more purposeful with our decisions on where to play, and how to win and that will affect the capital decisions. We're also renewing our focus on innovation. This is something that I humbly bring in this job. This is something I care a great deal about. One of the things that I did subtly was I elevated the Chief Technology Officer position reporting to me. This was to reassert our leadership in critical technologies. And we're building a more robust mobility business under Marcy Klevorn, who also has responsibility for as Chief Information Officer, the computing in our business and we have a unique opportunity to merge the mobility and computing for future digital services. We're transforming the culture and we're creating an environment to win. This is going to be hard to describe without you following me around every day. But it starts with the renewed recognition that we're in an incredibly competitive industry. And the competition just doesn't relax because we're thinking through a problem, opportunity or because we had a management change, it's relentless. We have a talented team here at Ford and we believe we can be really competitive, a team that we're working on empowering and re-energizing to grow our business. So, that work in those five points is well underway in that 100 days, and I look forward to sharing more, as I said with you later this year about detailed plans to make Ford even stronger and more innovative, not only built to weather the business cycles, but to win in future growth areas. Okay. Well, turning to the second quarter. I do believe we delivered a solid performance. I'm really proud of our team with all the change we went through, they did it. But it needs to be said no one here is satisfied. We know and I want to emphasize this, we all know we have a lot of work to do. And our entire team is focused on these areas of growing revenue, improving fitness, optimizing the capital deployment and innovation in all parts of the business, and having the spirit of an environment to win. In order to improve the top and bottom lines, we're going to be focusing on these things in the quarters ahead. On the next slide, I'll share a few highlights from the quarter, if you happened just to be gone during the last quarter and you didn't know what was going on at Ford. Some exciting things here are F-Series, including the Super Duty continue to perform extremely well, and we look forward to the refreshed F-150 going on sale this fall. This is our product that is so successful. We're going to be building on momentum here. The quarter, we also had sales success in China in a number of areas, including the best ever June sales for Ford Motor Company and the best ever June and quarterly sales for the Lincoln brand. This quarter in Europe, well, we launched the All-New Fiesta, this is an important model for us in the region, a very popular vehicle. All the early reviews have been great. We're also making important strides in quality. We improved significantly to become, listen to this, the number 2 ranked non-premium brand in this year's J.D. Power Initial Quality Study. It's our best result in the 31-year history of the company. I was really proud to hear about that, receive that as I walked into my job and credit is due to all the hardworking folks at Ford for that accomplishment. This quarter, we also made a decision. It was in the news that we would source the next-gen Ford Focus for the North American market from China initially. This decision meets the preservation of capital and it's going to deliver significant savings. At the same time, we were proud to announce further investment in the Kentucky Truck Plant. This is going to build the new Expedition and Lincoln Navigator later this year, both very important new entries for us in large SUV segment, would urge all of you to take a ride in those. I think you're going to be really surprised. But now, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Shanks. He is going to take you through the second quarter financials and then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions today. Thank you again. Bob? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're going to start on slide 6 and I'll just cover very briefly other headlines and then we're going to start diving through the results for the balance of the presentation. So as you can see here, the company did grow in the quarter. Our adjusted pre-tax profit combined with a low effective tax rate generated an adjusted earnings per share that was $0.56, that was up 8% from a year ago. We did generate another quarter of Automotive operating cash flow on the positive side, and we did generate a margin of 5.9% on the Automotive business. Let's turn now to slide 7 and look at the key financial summary and I just want to highlight several things here, to bring out a bit more texture in terms of what happened. So, starting and focusing only on the second quarter at the top in terms of wholesales, we generated 1.7 million units in the quarter. That was down 43,000 units. 55,000 of that was Europe and within that, almost all of that was the Fiesta and we'll talk about the impact of that when we get to the European section. The revenue increase was four-tenths, only one-tenth of that was on the Automotive side of the business, the balance was in Financial Services. Going down further to special items pre-tax, $248 million charge. That was related to write-offs that we took associated with the decision to deploy capital away from small cars and specifically the next-generation Focus in both North and South America and as you know, we have announced that we're going to put the next-generation Focus for North America primarily in China with some derivatives also to come later from Europe. Further down from there, you can see the provision from income taxes, $209 million. You can see that's nearly $700 million better than the prior year. Within that, there is $421 million of good news that comes from distributions that we've taken from overseas that bring with them foreign tax credits that we've realized on the balance sheet. And what I'll say right now is that for the full year, we expect to have additional actions that we'll be taking in the same space, different types of actions, in the different parts of the business, but with the same effect that will generate a tax rate for the full year of about 15%. This result was a 10.2% effective tax rate in the quarter. Because of that, and then combined with the company pre-tax result of $2.5 billion, which was down about 16%, we were still able to generate an improvement on net, you can see at $2 billion that was up $72 million from a year ago. Adjusted EPS, I touched on, and then further down the page you see liquidity, which is continuing to be strong, and we'll talk more about that later. Okay, let's go to the next slide, slide 8, and here what I'd like to do is, just briefly talk about where the profits were earned. So, on the far left, you can see the total company adjusted pre-tax profit of $2.5 billion. $2.2 billion of that was generated by the Automotive segment. We had very strong results in Financial Services, $600 million, and then in All Other that's primarily our treasury-related activities, think of that as net interest expense and portfolio gains and losses, and then there is a very small piece of that that's related to the Ford Smart Mobility LLC. When you look below the chart, you can see that the decline in the Automotive segment drove the decline in the overall business. We had a very nice improvement in the Financial Services, and a small decline in All Other that was largely around the treasury-related activities. Let's move on to slide 9, and here what we're going to do is start looking at the Automotive segment only. So, on the far left is the $2.2 billion of profit that we generated in that segment, and then you can see right beside that the North American result. So, effectively every dollar that we earned in the Automotive segment was earned in North America. When you look to the right of that, you can see the ups and downs of the other regions. They all net to breakeven. But I would highlight within that we did generate our ninth consecutive quarterly profit in Europe and we had a good result in Asia Pacific. If you look below the chart, declines in North America and Europe on a year-over-year basis is what drove the decline in the segment. All the other regions improved. Now, let's move further into the Automotive segment and focus on our key metrics and we'll just go right across the page. You can see the top line and the first two metrics there, the wholesales I've touched on, down 3%, the revenue, basically flat as I mentioned. SAAR is not shown on the page, but the SAAR for the global industry is estimated at about 93.2 million units, that was up 4% and that was driven by increases in the industries of Asia Pacific, Europe and South America. Market share, 7.4%, was down a tenth and that was driven by declines in North America, Europe and Middle East and Africa with the other regions going in the positive direction. And then, you can see the margin was down and the pre-tax results was down as well. Let's go to the next slide and let's look at what was behind the decline in profitability, $641 million. Basically, it was three factors; it was higher commodity cost and we talked about that in the first quarter call. You can see here in the second quarter, an impact of $387 million with that mainly being steel, although we did have increases across the other commodities. If you take that combined with the first quarter we're at a roughly $600 million of increase, we're looking at about $1.2 billion for the full year. So, we expect to have about the same amount of headwind in the second half on a year-over-year basis that we've seen here in the first quarter. Second factor is exchange. You can see $154 million, most of that around Europe. That is more than explained by weakness in the pound sterling and then also weakness in Asia Pacific related to the Chinese renminbi. And then the third factor, just to refresh your memory, this time a year ago, we were telling you about a gain on the sale of an entity called OEConnection, that generated a profit improvement of $150 million, obviously this year on a year-over-year basis is not occurring. So, those three factors explain what happened. Don't want to leave the page though without highlighting the fact that our market factors were positive over $200 million and within that, when you look at the callout box on volume and mix, look at the very, very strong mix that we generated. Most of that being mix among in terms of products, but also some very good performance in terms of series mix and options, which is the strategy that the team has been deploying for some time now to drive the mixes of each of our individual products into the higher series and it's proving to be quite successful. And we did generate an improvement in net pricing for the segment and the year as well. Let's move on now to the regions, and we'll start, first, as always with North America and these are the key factors. Starting from the left, wholesales were down, just a little bit above 8,000 units, 1%. The revenue up 3%, that was driven by the mix. If we look at the SAAR, the SAAR for the region at 21 million units was down 0.5 million units. That was fully explained by a decline in the U.S. The U.S. came in at 17 million SAAR and again that was down 500,000 units. Market share was down one-tenth. That was explained by the U.S., and that was explained by lower fleet and that was explained by cars. If we move over to margin, you can see we had a strong margin of 9%, but that was down from last year and then a profit of $2.2 billion, down 19%. If we move to the next slide and look at what was behind the $0.5 billion decline in profitability, very similar to the Automotive segment, but I would call out just the two factors; one, the higher commodity cost. Most of the company's commodity cost decline occurred here. And then, of course, the non-repeat of the gain on the sale of the OEConnection LLC majority stake that we had. I do want to highlight the engineering. You can see the engineering here is up $126 million. That was the increase for the segment as well and that was largely explained by the investments that we're making in strengthening our utility lineup and also a bit of the investment in our AVs. Again, I want to highlight the market factors. We had favorable mix, 217 million units, most of that was driven by Super Duty, so that was both the mix among effect as well as very strong derivatives performance within the Super Duty. And then, you can see we did have higher pricing as well in the quarter. Okay. Let's go on to slide 14. Here what I'd like to underscore, again, some of the metrics we've been sharing with you that demonstrate the disciplined approach we're taking to the business here in the United States, but I just want to note that this is the same approach we take to our business everywhere in the world, not just the U.S., but we'll use the U.S. to highlight the effect of that. So, you can see around transaction prices, our transaction prices in the quarter driven by strong mix, particularly Super Duty, F-Series, Raptor is in that as well, five times what the industry saw in terms of an increase. If you look to the right, incentive as a percent of vehicle price over the last number of months. You can see that we've been around no increase and in fact two of the three months it was a decline, which drove a small decline for the quarter and that compares with an increase for the industry. And on the lower left, we ended the quarter at 79 days of gross supply for the U.S. That was only up one day, but for the full year, our take on our stock levels are that they're in very, very good shape overall. Okay. Let's move now to South America. And here again, third quarter in a row, we're seeing improvement on a year-over-year basis in the key metrics in right across the board. And I think the thing that was very encouraging here is the SAAR for the region at 4.2 million units was up six-tenths. Half of that was Brazil. Finally, we've gotten to a quarter, where Brazil is up on a year-over-year basis. Now, a lot of that was direct sales, but the other economic metrics we're looking at in terms of PMI, inflation, exchange is stabilizing. All of that is looking more favorable, although, of course, all of us are watching very closely the political developments there. Looking at wholesales, wholesales were up 12%, revenue up 18%. We had very strong performance by the Ka. And that was evidenced in the market share, which was up by five-tenths of a point, and again completely driven by the Ka. Margin improved and you can see the pre-tax loss reduced by $80 million. Go to the next slide, which is slide 16, and look at what was behind that improvement in the loss. And you can see it's entirely driven by favorable market factors, both the volume. And you can see that a lot of it was around the pricing. The good news for me was around the cost. Because we're starting to see a much mitigated level of inflation, the efforts that the team have been making in terms of reducing cost is now more clearly flowing through. And you can see here that despite the fact that we still have some inflationary pressures, our costs were flat in the quarter, a little bit of bad news on exchange, but even that was much less than what it has been. So, feeling much, much better about the direction of the business now in South America, and certainly the work the team has done over the last several years to really thrift out, reduce, lean the business, I think, with the top line now starting to come back, a lot of that's going to flow right through. If you go to the following slide in terms of Europe, in Europe, all the key metrics are lower and I'll explain what's behind that. I've already talked to the wholesales. The revenue is down largely because of the volume. The SAAR was actually up, 20.7 million, across the region. That was up nine-tenths. Within that, the UK was down, so we are now finally seeing what we had expected to see from the effect of pricing and other effects across the economy, a slowdown in the UK industry. So, that was down two-tenths of a point of SAAR. On the other hand, in Russia, similar to Brazil, really excited to see this market starting to come back now in terms of some of the external metrics. The SAAR was up two-tenths as well on a year-over-year basis. When we look at share, the share was down two-tenths of a point that was more than explained by Fiesta. So that's another one of these Fiesta launch effects that I'll talk about shortly. Within that, our commercial vehicles performed very, very well. We once again on a brand basis were the number one selling commercial vehicle brand and we grew share in the quarter in addition. When you look at margin and pre-tax results, both of them down sharply. And if you go to the next page, we'll talk about what's behind that. So this \u2013 I'm on slide 18. So we were down about $380 million. Almost literally half of that is related across a number of these factors due to Brexit. The biggest impact is exchange, so a much bigger effect than actually what's shown in the singular bar there, directly related to Brexit. We also saw the industry decline, which is buried within the \u2013 in fact the industry \u2013 as I mentioned to you, the industry was up, but you can see the industry dollars is down. That's the effect of the UK, because it's a high margin market. Then we had, of course, an offset in terms of pricing. So, that's buried within that small improvement of net pricing. We did also see launch effects of the all-new Fiesta and that's spread across a number of these factors. So again, for those of you that don't know, Fiesta is our biggest selling product in Europe. This is an all-new product. We are just in the launch phase. The initial reaction from the media has been extremely strong on the product. So, very excited to get this to the market and give the customers the opportunity to enjoy it. The third factor is commodity cost. And you can see that in the callout box for contribution cost of about $70 million. So, those three factors fully explain the decline. When you look at the rest of the business, the other item I'd like to highlight is, once again, we had the year-over-year improvement in Russia. In terms of what we expect for the rest of the year, we expect Europe to remain profitable, although, it's going to be below the levels of 2016. And it's basically the same story we've been talking about. We think that the profits will be down about $500 million, $600 million \u2013 about $600 million related to Brexit. That probably is about the decline that we'll see in total for the business. In addition, you will see some headwinds from higher commodity cost, which will offset probably in other parts of the business. Okay. Let's go to the following slide, which is slide 19 and now we turn to Middle East and Africa. And just to refresh your memory, we've been talking here about declining industries, declining performance for us in the Middle East. A lot of this due to external factors related to geopolitical issues and lower price of oil. That is continuing, although maybe some signs of it starting to mitigate when we look at some of the external economic factors. When you look at wholesales, down pretty sharply, 37%. Revenue was down because of the volume. The industry was down about 12% in the markets where we participate. You can see that our share was down 1.2 points. That was almost fully explained by the Middle East, where we are still working through some performance issues. And go to the right of that, you can see the margin down. Yet for the first time now for a while, we're starting to see the loss reduce and it improved from $65 million a year ago to $53 million this quarter. When we turn to the following slide, it's a small improvement, but to me the thing that's interesting and exciting about this is how we got there. When you look at the cost factors, the team continues to do a really good job in the face of a lot of difficulties on the top line to generate cost savings. The exchange is moving in our direction as well, that's around South Africa and euro. If you go to the far left though, you'll see the impact of volume and it's across all elements in the business, industry, share, stock adjustments, in line with that. So, a lot of work ahead of us on that, but we still continue to expect the Middle East and Africa to improve this year compared to 2016 due to lower cost, favorable exchange and lower volume. And a lot of that \u2013 in fact, all of that improvement is going to take place in the second half of the year. So, I expect to see better results on a year-over-year basis in the second half of the year than what we've seen in the first half. When you get to the following slide on Asia Pacific, the last of our Automotive business units, a lot of positive stories here. Wholesales up 24,000 units or 7%. That's all explained by China. Circling back to the first quarter, we talked about some issues that we had in China in the first quarter and we were down. We talked about improving in the quarter in China and the team succeeded in that regard. They've revised the go-to-market strategy. I think we still have more work ahead of us, frankly, but we did generate an improvement year-over-year in terms of sales in China in the quarter, but more work ahead of us. And you can see some of that here in the wholesales to support that. Revenue was up in our consolidated activities. Interestingly that includes some of the activities inside China, including Lincoln because those are consolidated. In terms of SAAR, the SAAR was at 43.7 million units. That was up 2.3 million. Of that, China was 1.9 million. So the industry's recovered from the first quarter and is growing quite nicely now. When we look at market share, we were up one-tenth, and that was driven by JMC along with Lincoln in China. It was all China that drove the market share. Margin recovered nicely to about 4% and pre-tax results at $143 million, an improvement of $150 million from a year ago. On the lower right of the slide, I'll spend a second on this. So, this is, as we usually report, our China JV net income. So it's equity after tax, what we get, was $195 million. The margin was 10.7%. Both of those were down, so let's talk about the profit. I'll explain it through the profits. The profits were down, that we get, about $100 million. The majority of that is due to lower investment incentives that we received in China. Most of that is due to just the timing of incentives this year versus the timing of incentives last year. For the full year, we expect incentives to be a bit lower, but much less than what we're seeing in the quarter. So you need to think about this as not something that you multiply four times. We also had some headwinds related to the exchange that I mentioned earlier. Go to the following slide and we'll look at the improvement of $150 million and what was behind that. So you can see it was driven by favorable volume. We also had favorable mix in the quarter. It was offset in part by the negative net pricing in China that we continue to see. But then we had favorable cost performance. I've talked about the exchange, and then within the other, that is more than explained by the timing and the lower level of investment incentives in the quarter that I referenced just a bit earlier. If we think about the full year, we expect Asia Pacific to improve. That's no change from prior guidance, and that will be driven by favorable volume and mix and lower cost. We still expect, on a full year basis, industry pricing to be negative and we also expect to see unfavorable exchange due to the renminbi flow-through as well. Okay, that's it for Automotive. Let's move now to Ford Credit. Where \u2013 we've got some really great performance to talk about and you can see it here on this slide, the business grew $8 billion in terms of managed receivables and that was driven largely by retail financing globally. And then, the pre-tax result was up 55% at $619 million. We'll talk in a second about what was behind that, but it was pretty broad-based, when you look at what drove the improvement. If you look at some of the portfolio metrics on this particular slide, very strong. Average placement FICO over 740, consistent more or less where it had been. The delinquencies remain in a very, very good place and the loss/receivables ratio, while it's up, is certainly well within our expectations from where we are at this point in the cycle. So, overall, very robust portfolio performance combined with great bottom line performance and growth. If you turn to the next slide, on slide 24, this is what's behind it. You can see most of the factors are green and positive. We had favorable volume and mix, that's the growth that we talked about, the margin was favorable. Credit loss reserve was good. We actually did increase the reserve for credit losses in the quarter. We just increased it much less so than last year. Lease residuals are flat. I think that's a victory. That's been one of the biggest headwinds of the business now for quite a number of quarters, but as it has been written about by many of you and others in the media, we are seeing less of a downward draft on auction values than what we had expected, and certainly that's reflected here. We still expect our auction values or residual values to fall on an average basis by about 6%. But if you go back to what I said in the first quarter, I said about 6%, that was a round down to 6%. This quarter, it's a round up to 6%. So even within that number, we're seeing some improvement. Then we go to the far right, you can see other and we had a $90 million improvement in our derivatives and this was based on favorable interest rate movements. If you go to the following slide and look at some of our financing trends. Again this continues, I think a similar story what we've talked about in the quarter, we're seeing leasing pull back a bit and you can see that we came down, as did the industry. To the far right, on the upper part of the chart, you can see what I was talking about. In the quarter, we had a seasonal \u2013 seasonally or a sequential increase for the second quarter in a row in terms of average auction values. And on a year-over-year basis down only about 4.5%; again that is less than what we had expected or more than what \u2013 less than what we had expected. If you go to the lower left, in terms of severity, that's looking very healthy and we talked about the LTR. So, overall, what we're seeing is strong credit quality, strong business environment and healthy consumer credit conditions and that's reflected in really great results for Ford Credit. Let's move on now to cash flow. Looking at the Automotive segment. So, in the middle of the page, you can see the $1.3 billion that we generated. The one thing I'd highlight is the negative impact of changes in working capital that was primarily in payables, a lot of that associated with the launch of the Fiesta in Europe. So we had much lower production in the last 45 days of the quarter related to that. We also had some inventory holds in other parts of our business for various reasons, which have subsequently unwound. But, at the end of the quarter, that had an impact. The only other things I would highlight is that we're still on track to our guidance for capital spending, pension contributions and also full year shareholder distributions. Moving on to slide 27, the balance sheet metrics, the only thing I'd comment here, we can take questions later, is everything is in great shape, the balance sheet remains strong, Ford Credit well capitalized, a lot of good liquidity there. And in terms of pensions, we still expect by the time we get to the end of the year, it's not reflected here, but based on what we're seeing in terms of the key metrics that drive our pension funding obligation status, we expect it to improve from where it had been at the end of 2016. Moving on to more of an outlook discussion, looking at GDP and industry planning assumptions, GDP is unchanged in the second column from what we guided previously, but on the right hand side, industry is up a bit on the global basis. We have taken the U.S. down, a couple of 100,000 units from prior guidance to 17.5 million. That's really driven primarily by lower fleet sales. Brazil up a tenth, Europe up a couple of tenths, and China down a couple of tenths. So, some small movements up or down, but probably the one that's most noteworthy to you is the U.S., a little bit softer than what we had expected, but that's driven by fleet sales. Now, let's spend a little bit of time on guidance, because we're making a couple of changes here. So, as you guys all know that we have historically provided an adjusted pre-tax profit outlook for the company, we've then separately provided a tax rate. So, we're going to be moving from this point forward to a methodology, which is used by others and it's understood very well by you and the Street to use an adjusted EPS and so you see that in the first column. So, our guidance for the year is of $1.65 to $1.85. To the right of that, importantly, is the tax rate that I referred to earlier. Now, to help you understand how to think about the guidance, if you take the last quarter guidance and you put it on the same basis, it would be $1.58, that was the about $9 billion, 30% tax rate. So, clearly the range is higher, but it's driven by the tax rate. So to help you further, if you were to take the top end of that range, that's effectively about the $9 billion, it's a little bit less than in absolutes since then $9 billion, but that's effectively about the $9 billion. And then beneath that, think about that as our view of potential risks, as we think about market factors or cost performance over the balance of the year. So it's not necessarily something that we see happening, but as we look at history from this point forward, and we think about the environment that we're in, we're providing for various outcomes on both market factors and cost performance that takes us to the lower end of the range. The other thing I would highlight is the tax rate. And then the other thing that may be helpful to you, as we think about the second half of the year, we do expect the second half of the year to be lower than the first half, that's based on seasonal factors, historical experience, but this year also related to the launch of the Expedition and the Navigator. Those will be going through effectively launch the entire quarter, don't expect to see any wholesales until the beginning of the fourth quarter. And then in terms of 2018, we've provided a view on 2018. Ever since Investor Day back in September, we've continued to share that with you at other events. We're not doing that today, because of the reassessment that Jim has us working on, and we'll share more on the business later this year as he said earlier. And then on slide 30, this is our full year guidance puts and takes. It's been updated and reflects our latest thinking. So if you have any questions on that, we can take that later. And then finally, on slide 31, our view of the key takeaways. So a solid quarter, certainly a lot of excitement here as we progress our 100-day review. The second one is around all the metrics we've shared, Ford Credit, strong results, the balance sheet in great shape, continuing to run the business in a very healthy way and then of course the guidance update that we just talked about. So with that, Ted, I think we're ready to move into Q&A. Ted Cannis - Ford Motor Co.: So with that, we'd like to turn it over to questions for the team here. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for taking my question. First question is really on tax. You touched on the drivers of the significant reduction in tax rate this year. Firstly, is there anything you can say more about the change from 30% to 15%, which is pretty big? And secondly, does the lower tax rate this year have the potential to impact future years? And thirdly, is the change more to book taxes, or will there also be an improvement to cash taxes and if so, how material could that benefit be? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yes. Thanks, Ryan. It's a good question. So, in terms of tax, think about the effect that we're talking about is being 2017, I would think when we get into 2018 we'll move back to a more normal tax rate of around 30%. Obviously, we'll update you on that when we provide the guidance for next year. But, I would see that as something that we're doing this year. So, the other way to think about what's happening, the tax team, who as I said, has just done a great job, they had line of sight to the actions that we're talking about affecting 2017 that we'd be taking in some of the years ahead of us. But, frankly, in anticipation of potential corporate tax reform and again no idea when that happens, but also not knowing what it is, the team recommended that we take these actions that we had planned to do perhaps later in our planning period and pull them into this year, which is what we are doing. And I'm not going to get into specifics of the one action that we took in the quarter, as I said there will be others in the second half of the year, but effectively they're bringing distributions back to the U.S. Those distributions are bringing with them foreign tax credits which we're then recognizing on the balance sheet. So, in terms of the impact on cash taxes, this is a book tax effect, would not expect it to have any near-term impact on cash taxes, but certainly at some point in the future it will, so this is real in terms of both profit and cash, but the cash impact will be later. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, thank you. And then just lastly for me, I thought to ask on Ford Credit, obviously very strong in the quarter. When you first got it to $1.5 billion for full year 2017 in November last year in the absence of knowing anything better, I just sort of assumed $750 million in the first half, $750 million in the back half, you've done $1.1 billion to-date. Can you say anything about the cadence of Ford Credit profits this year in order to help us maybe gauge, how much better than $1.5 billion could the division be tracking for the full year? And then just sticking with Ford Credit, the lease residuals, those tracking better, does that do anything to change your previously communicated outlook that prices would continue to fall through 2019 or some of the actions you're doing on rental cars or something else maybe helping you rethink that? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yes. So in terms of cadence, we're not providing a specific number in terms of profit for the year. It will be better. Second half will be lower than the first half. So, I certainly wouldn't take $1.1 billion times 2. That is not happening. But it will be better than the $1.5 billion. And to the question that you had around, how are we thinking about \u2013 and let's not talk about auction values but more residual values as a percent of sales price, because we actually expect over time that those will rise and we want to kind of focus on the percentage, if you will, residual values as a percent of that. But we are still expecting, as I said, it's about 6% year-over-year, which would suggest a pretty sharper decline later this year in order to land in that spot. So, we'll have to wait and see if that happens. Frankly, the team just gave me a report yesterday, the latest weekly report, and things are still holding up well. So, we haven't seen the signs yet of anything happening. We've certainly heard that we can expect to see some declines coming from the next ALG update. So we'll have to work our way through that. But that's what we're kind of providing for in that guidance. In terms of looking at 2018 and 2019, nothing has changed in terms of our expectations. We're still expecting that residual values as a percent of vehicle price will be declining and we're building that into all of the new business that we're writing. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Just want to get underneath the kind of puts and takes and revisions to the outlook. It looks like with the tax credit benefit, you will be taking that it appears that the midpoint of pre-tax seems to be as mentioned coming down from the roughly $9 billion that you talked about. Can you, A, confirm that and, B, with the regions performing a little bit better this quarter, where is that op and with certainly Ford Credit now poised to contribute more? Where do you sense that operating weakness is likely to come from? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yes. So, first of all, you shouldn't assume that our own point of view in terms of where the business is at the midpoint. But you are right. I mean you can calculate and figure out what the midpoint is and it would be further below the prior guidance of $9 billion and just a bit below which is where the top end is. But, please don't assume that's necessarily where we are in terms of our own single point estimate. But to the point you are raising, we are looking at the business both in terms of market factors and cost performance. We are trying to provide some recognition of the fact that we don't have control over everything and so there's two I would highlight. One is the commodity cost, which as I said, will be up based on what we think right now about $1.2 billion on a year-over-year basis. By the way, they were favorable last year by $900 million, so you can see how they can swing. The exchange is another factor that obviously will be what it's going to be and then frankly, the other one is around warranty expense and the potential for recalls. We don't forecast recalls. In fact we don't know, I personally don't know about recalls or others until the team has done the work and the data supports an action and then we move and we move very, very quickly. But as you are very well aware we have seen, some recalls that have had material financial impact over the last number of quarters, and so this provides us a little bit of space for that as well. But I would add, Brian, that a couple of things since the first quarter guidance that has taken place, actually three things, very specifically that we've accommodated in this range, one is higher incentives across all regions of the world, not really large in any one region, but when you add them up, it's a factor. The second is higher warranty expense already in North America and that's related to coverages. So, not recalls, but coverages, normal 36 months, 36,000 miles that sort of thing. Also something, some related to our extended warranty that we provide on some of our components. And then the last, which is an offset, which is what you raised is a favorable view of what Ford Credit is going to bring to the business. So those three together, in an absolute sense, will take you a bit lower than $9 billion, but contained within the upper end of the guidance. The rest of it is really a risk assessment. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And now a question for Jim. I know you're still in the midst of this 600-day fitness assessment, but one thing that jumps out at us is the gap in North American margins between Ford and GM, which is now running around 300 basis points. What's your observations of that? Ford still historically has traded at premium to GM, primarily thinking that the brand equity was stronger, that brands were better positioned. But to the extent that is, it's certainly not showing up in the margins in North America. So wondering, if you have some points of view on that and how just preliminary that might be addressed at the end of the 100 days? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I think, Brian, it fits the early comments I made about fitness that, that notion means, you're scanning for competitive improvements. People coming at you that you don't expect, as we start talking about the future, we'll be talking about competitors that are outside our industry. So that kind of thing gets my attention. I can understand that in ways with the SUV segment being so strong and our franchise being really strong in that same area, and this kind of perspective that you're bringing up is something that we talk about. So I can just confirm it's the kind of thing that doesn't go over the top of our head. It's not something at all that I'm worried about addressing and I also have great optimism that when we talk to you about how we're going to address that, there is big opportunity there. Just for all the listeners and in regard here, we changed the organization on May 22. So, there were 19 direct reports in the last administration, I have 8 and I'm an executive team that, the speed in which they can address something like what you just talked about, there's a big improvement. You wouldn't know that based on the data which you are looking at right now, but that's the promise that hope to prove to you. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Hey, Brian, it's Bob. The only thing that I would add and again it's not to denigrate GM's performance because I think what they're doing is quite impressive I think. But we do have to and you guys recognize this as well and they do as well, there has been a lot of stock build. So, I think when you want to compare margins and that type of thing, you really have got to neutralize that effect on both sides. And if you look at our business in the quarter, we actually had a stock decline in the quarter in the U.S., and in North America, we had a very small stock \u2013 favorable stock change. That was not the U.S. which is where high margins are. So that's the only caveat I would put as, on an apples to apples basis probably gap isn't quite as large as what you said. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And just final question around capital, are you open to sort of bold moves around capital consumption ranging, whether it's from investing in product lines all the way to spinning out or joint venturing major parts of the business that consume big chunks of cash? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, I mean you called it bold, I think it's just part of the fitness cadence and discipline that I'm really trying to stress. I mean this is one of the most important things the leadership can do, is making choices in a way that really preserves capital, gets the kind of returns that you would expect, so of course all of that is in the air up for grabs. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Jim, I'd like to just ask a couple more questions about the things that you are assessing in the first 100 days. First of all, just on this innovation question, what do you think can change to accelerate the pace of innovation and the clock speed at a company like Ford and to make the company more competitive in terms of speed and risk-taking with some of the tech companies that you've had quite a bit of exposure to? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Rod, this is the area that I probably have the most confidence and I'm humble about what I'm about to say to you, because I have to prove it here. But surprisingly in a company like Ford, all the talent's here, all the capability is here, so I got to confirm that with you. It's what happened in business history, there was a little bit of a shift in terms of the way that you understand the nature of the way people use products. You marry that with really rigorous development processes and you have success. And so, the inference is that that frontend part, the way we understand use, think about that as building more value in products, but there is also a reductive opportunity, there's stuff that people don't care about in vehicles that we shouldn't have there. And in the course of doing that, I want to confirm that this is one of the pleasant surprises I've had when I got closer to Ford from just being on the board, is they have mastery in key systems like the financial systems as an example. They have mastery in the ability to engineer product to market. The quality metrics that you're hearing about and there is an ongoing report of quality. There is definitely change there. So, I want to leverage what got better over the last, say, seven or eight years in those areas and marry them with some of the innovation techniques that I won't go on about today, I want to share all of that, that I understand. And the way you walk away from that discussion is you realize that the people all of a sudden are saying, I like the Ford products better and they like them a lot now. They are really popular, Mustang and F-150, but I see opportunity in every area where we can be better. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: So, just to understand that a little bit better, is the management team and you specifically dissatisfied with what you see at this point in terms of the clock speed or the changes that you're seeing from an innovation perspective? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, this is a kind of question that could come up a few times a day. So, let me step back and tell you one of the first things we did going from 19 to 8, is we addressed the, what I call, the point of view ownership. Think of that as when you have a lot of things that are triangulating for attention and clarity. These are big decisions. But the simple notion that somebody owns that point of view is an empowering and freeing stance. So, we went through exercises together as a team to clear that up and we're already seeing the effect. So, we're speeding up decision-making. We're speeding up the way that choices are clarified. A neat consequence from that, that was a word that Alan used to use, wasn't it, neat. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Neat and cool. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Neat and cool. So, a neat consequence of that is we've been able to free up time on the executives' calendars. I just did the math last night. It's about 30 minutes a day that was taken off of their calendars that were corporate kind of requirements. So, when you work the hours these folks do and how hard they are working all over the world, that's found money. And then that translates in ways. The body language is now translating down to the teams that work for these folks. So, again, if you're following me around, we got some early momentum here. It's too early to report in this quarterly call to you, but you asked the question, how do I see that infiltrating? And that is what you pick up in startup companies, in tech companies. They haven't grown to the size of Ford. So, they didn't have that kind of hierarchy that I inherited. So, they have some advantages in that regard that we don't have to cede that to anybody else. We can bring those in and that's what we've begun to do. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And just, lastly, a question on how you're thinking about capital allocation and the portfolio of businesses and products. One of the biggest paybacks that we've seen over time in the industry is actually when the industry exits segments that have been \u2013 the companies have been involved with maybe just \u2013 maybe based on tradition more than anything else. But they're obviously challenging segments and you can think about regions that have been challenging for many years and maybe so for a long time. Is this reassessment that you're looking at also that broad that you're questioning regions or segments, markets that Ford is currently in? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yes. And I don't want to dismiss your question with this response. I mean you've got to believe the capability of the folks running the company, including myself. Don't fall asleep on that question. I mean there's other forces that tend to put that in a vice and hold it. And that's what you are accurate about. You have to break that hold to say, what's causing us to hang in there. And every time, if you look back with me that we hung in a market was because we actually took actions to improve and maybe it didn't work. So I think the new reality that I can kind of confirm to you is that we really have to ask ourselves what do we have to believe to get to the kind of returns that we expect and you expect. And if we can't answer that, then we can't be there. That's making the choice when you hear us talk about playing to win and where to play, that is what that code means, is that you are clarifying where you're going to put capital. You've seen decisions from us already in the short 60-plus days that the new teams come together and the decision to put the Focus in China is an example of that. We saved a bunch of money doing that and there is other things like that that will be forthcoming. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, guys. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Good morning, John. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Maybe just a first question here, Bob, on the guidance, and just doing some real dumb guy's math here. I mean it looks like, at the high end of the range which you're relatively more endorsing than the low end, you do about $4 billion in pre-tax in the second half of the year roughly. And your guidance range though does kind of imply a pre-tax range of almost $1 billion. So, that $1 billion is against that $4 billion in the second half of the year. I am just curious, I mean you kind of highlighted these three factors, but I mean is there something else going on or is it just a big recall maybe around Takata that you think might create incremental expense in the second half of the year because it's just a big relative range to that remainder of the year? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah. I agree with you. I think it is in part around some of the \u2013 if I go back and look at the last year-and-a-half in particular, we've had a number of material recalls that, again, for the reasons that I mentioned, don't know about them and then they happen, and not in the guidance because we didn't know about them. So, what we're trying to protect for is the possibility of something like that. Again, nothing that obviously has been acted upon because otherwise by definition we would have done it. Takata is actually not relevant in that conversation, I think, at least from our point of view, because we actually have gone back to the government and indicated that there's no facts or circumstances that would support us in doing something. So, we are having that conversation with them. But it's really more around risk assessment of that, if something like that happening. Also, just looking at a historical experience in terms of market factors, what could happen in terms of market factors from this point forward, commodities out there. They've started to actually get a little bit better from the first quarter, but that's a concern, exchange and other. So it's really more around risk assessment. That's the way I would think about it and not that there's something going on. There's something that we have in mind. I think it is fair to say that at the moment we're more towards the upper part of that range, but we're just trying to protect for the potentiality of something along the lines that you talked about occurring. That's it. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's very helpful. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: What I would expect when we get to the third quarter obviously the range will be a lot less. And we'll narrow it down and have a better feel for ultimately where we're coming out for obvious reasons, but this is where we are today. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a second question on your mix being positive $310 million in the quarter, I think you highlighted, goes far beyond just segment shift, but there is also a shift we see in vehicle lines as you are selling \u2013 up-selling the consumer. I'm just curious how much of that do you think is sticky over time, how much of that is very Ford specific? And are you getting into a higher set of customers that are willing to pay you sort of mass market, luxury sort of premium kind of prices that will stick around for a while? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, this is something that we've had a lot of success in North America. It's a big part of the story here both around product mix, but also the derivative mix. Stephen Odell and then Jim Farley in Europe made that a central part of the transformation plan there and that's been extremely successful. And Jim's still pushing the team there, but everywhere around the world for the dollars to be mined from that approach. So, I wouldn't say \u2013 and I should mention also China. We've also picked up over time a lot of good news there from bringing in the Edge, the Taurus. We're taking the same derivative strategy in China too. So, it's not just a single market that we're taking that approach because we know it works and successful and customers actually love those types of products. What I would say though just to condition you, when we look at the first half, we've picked up quite a bit of good news on mix on a year-over-year basis, about $700 million. I don't see that happening in the second half. And the second half is probably a bit flat to even maybe slightly negative. And that's because on some of the big contributors of the more recent improvements and particularly Super Duty we start lapping ourselves, in terms of when the product came in and the derivatives in the high \u2013 the high derivatives at the beginning of the launch, et cetera. I think Fiesta will give us an opportunity in Europe. So I think that's one that we should look out for, because I would expect that to follow. But I do believe if we take it out longer than just the half, certainly Jim's view is that, there is gold to be mined in the hills and he is going to keep pushing us. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And I would add, Bob, that coming in new, when I was on the board, we got to tour that plant, that was building the new F-150 with the aluminum underpinnings. And when you drive that vehicle and you know, it's handling characteristics, and I made reference to its contribution in this last year to MPG improvement. It is the significant factor that's improved our goal, our march towards a cycle plan more than any other vehicle in anybody's inventory. But where I want to go is, when I drove that car, that vehicle for the first time, and the kind of feeling I had, I believe the word spreads in this kind of industry, and here we have a product that's now starting to be understood and very popular. And then, as I mentioned in my comments, the refresh is coming, and as Bob's conditioning you, we know we've sold a lot of these vehicles, but we believe there's still a lot to be had, and that's what's helping that transaction price go up. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And maybe just \u2013 I apologize, maybe just a follow-up on that. I mean the Expedition and Navigator launching next year. I mean, if you make up some ground on GM and Ford, that might be a $1 billion or $2 billion opportunity. I mean, is that also \u2013 I mean off the back of the F-150 platform, and similarly fuel efficient, is there a real big opportunity here when the Expedition and Navigator launch next year or actually really hit dealerships next year? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yes, we definitely see the Expedition and Navigator as an opportunity both in terms of volume and certainly in terms of price, transaction price, mix and so forth. That's a really big opportunity. That's why I wanted to make sure that you understood. Even the old one was quite profitable, right? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yes. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: So, I wanted to make sure that when I was talking about the third quarter, you understood, we're basically not wholesaling hardly any of those old or new in the quarter, and then we'll start filling the pipeline in the fourth quarter and then of course it really will pick off and take off in 2018. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And this is why I talk about the handling of those vehicles in my early comments. You're going to have to drive one to feel what I'm talking about, but there's a definite marked improvement, I think competitively. It's going to be really interesting how they react to that. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Looking forward to it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Good morning and thank you for taking our questions. First, I want to just stick with the U.S. market. I think you brought down your assumptions from around 17.8 million to 17.5 million total SAAR, so about 17.2 million light. Wondering how you feel about the market going forward from 2017 into 2018 and 2019? Are we in a plateau mode in the 17 million, should it grind lower into the 16 million? That's kind of point one. And then on the back of that, Jim, as you think about North America cycle peaking and coming down, what type of levers do you expect to pull to maintain profitability? Are you going to be quick to pull out production, is it incentives, do you drive back more sales to the daily rental channel? How are you thinking about navigating what looks like a cycle peak and decline from there last year and at least in North America? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay, Dave. Let me take those and see if then Jim would like to comment. So in terms of industry, we don't have it in this deck, but we had indicated in our prior guidance, and I think it was 17.7 million, the prior guidance, that we would see a further decline in 2018. So I think the way to think about it \u2013 I know we're all kind of struggling with this to figure it out, because I see what you guys are forecasting too. Our view is that what, however, you wanted to describe it, an eroding plateau, I've seen that, or however you want to characterize it, very strong sales, we don't see anything in terms of the economy, the health of the consumer, housing, oil, the oil production is back up and that's had an impact on trucks for example, that would suggest that over the next two \u2013 let's say two years, that there's any kind of significant collapse or dramatic change. We do think it's going to decline. We think it will be a soft gradual decline. What we're seeing this year seem to be more on the retail side, probably, or fleet side related to what's happening with auction values, a lot of that with rental, but that seems to be the effect this year, we'll have to just wait and see when we go into the next two years or so, what does happen. That's our view and what we'll do is, as we always do, we update this monthly and we'll share it with you kind of real time, as we have the chance to get together. But that's our view, it's declining, but it's still going to be very strong. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: In North America, Bob, the belief is, David, that all the work we're doing for new products, these are going to be forthcoming, so there's an improvement in the mix of products because of what we're inventing. We see opportunities, as I mentioned a minute ago, in the F-Series with the refresh. You've already acknowledged the Expedition and the Navigator, Transit as well. This is a product that has very high share and has a big advantage in terms of people love what it can do and so we're investing there as well, so think of the North American product mix isn't sitting still. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: The other thing that I would add in terms of things that we would think about as the industry softens a bit. To me, there is no better time than to follow the principles of a disciplined approach to the business. You have got to be even more disciplined. You've got to be anticipating a bit more where the industry is going, where you see changes. You got to act superfast. And if anything what, and I know this is Jim Farley's mindset and Joe as well. The other thing that we should do, you don't wait for it to happen. You've got to start kind of leaning yourself down in the areas that you know will be affected by the downturn on the way towards what will be downturn, so for example stocks. We do have targets on stocks. But can we grind that a little bit lower than the target stocks, and can we kind of glide our way down a bit, so that when the sharper downturn occurs that we're in better shape once it starts. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And in earlier calls, Bob, I remember you were establishing that we were managing the days in inventory. Let's be candid, the world thought, oh, there's something amiss here, but as this quarter now and the industry plays out, we're real happy with our position right now in the inventories. We were managing that very well. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. I think that was clear. And on the go-forward, as we think about new company kind of three pillars of autos that's changing; mobility, electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, should we be expecting or naturally do we expect spend to continue to increase from here on all three of those? I mean is that the way that we're \u2013 or you're going to be approaching the business and somewhat expediting, some of the things that were going on at Ford Smart Mobility at a total company level and getting further into that electric vehicle platforms that were going to come out for 2020, further into the autonomous vehicle development, further into mobility? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yes, are you \u2013 when you are asking the question, Joe, are you thinking about incremental, are you asking me the question, can we get our total fitness to absorb \u2013 oh, excuse me, David, sorry. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Well, it's a mixture of both, right, because the spend, seems like it should increase to bring forward the clock speed if you will or pull forward some of this... James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yes. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: But then against the backdrop of a declining North America market, how should we think about overall spend? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yes, so, I'm going to let Bob tell you the way we're planning that in the current numbers. But I'll just give you the way my body language is. I want to question that you have to sit here and hear us say that, the core business as we knew it, all the spending there is as fit as it needed to be and everything new has to be incremental. I haven't bought that yet. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: And the only thing I would add, David, is that, this year, we expect in terms of CapEx, and we use that as the surrogate for what do you spend, because there is engineering and other things, but CapEx of about $7 billion. When you look at our 10-Q, which will come out later today, we had guided over the next five years to \u2013 previously to $8 billion to $9 billion. I think we're going to take that down to about $8 billion. So, I at the moment, would see us kind of moving up to that level, after this year, not necessarily all next year, but we'll have to wait and see where that pans out, but it's certainly, that's about the level that we see the business running in terms of CapEx. And one other thing that's kind of interesting in that regard, a lot of the things that we'll do in some of the mobility spaces, digital services are not capital intensive, so we have to remember that. Also, if you think about the actions that we took around the Focus for North America, we freed up $1 billion, so part of this is finding smarter ways, which is what Jim was talking on to deploy and allocate our capital, not just spend more. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And finally just in China, can you just talk to what you're seeing from a price down perspective, has it accelerated since the first quarter update? And exiting the second quarter, how do you feel your inventories are, given slower sales pace that we saw at least in the second quarter? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: The overall industry pricing accelerated in the second quarter, which I think we had expected. I think we're still on track towards, I want to say, 5% for the full year. And that seems to be pretty much in line with what we're experiencing ourselves. So, I think that's \u2013 that seems to be the path that we are on. We took a lot of actions in the second quarter to get our stocks in shape, because of the issues \u2013 the sales performance issues and also the lower industry that we talked about in the first quarter of the year. So, I think we are in pretty good shape right now. And then going back to the earlier question that we had \u2013 that you gave us around what do you do, I mean, Jim has been really fast with Joe as soon as we see sales miss or anything in the external environment that suggests that we need to take out stock we're doing it ASAP. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Understood. Thank you for the time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks for the time. A question for Jim. So one of the things you've mentioned is looking at capital. It's come up a couple of times, and making sure that's used efficiently. So along those lines, and as the industry migrates more towards xEV technology, well, first, do you have a sense of how much of your current PP&E is related to internal combustion engines? And I guess more importantly, what percent of that equipment do you think is flexible enough to be repurposed? And as you make new capital decisions, are those purchases being made with a certain level of flexibility in mind? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: I would say yes, yes, yes. I mean, I don't know that I'm going to tell you some of the internal strategic things about that, but remember, Ford's ability to produce an ICE engine and the kind of engineering to bring that to the level of quality that I think is world class is the same kind of talent that will allow us to bring these new Powertrains. And they themselves can carry the day I believe in the future with robust designs and better business models and better digital services. I mean, there is more to the quest for profit than just what's it cost us to build the vehicle. As we can stare at other competitors that are doing this and I am not worried about the embedded cost, let me just state this for the record, I am not worried about the sunk cost or the fixed cost we have in the old historical technologies, frustrating us about thinking of the future. It really doesn't matter. I mean, we're going to do what we got to do to make the company really successful and meet the kind of requirements that we have to meet and win the way you hear me talking about. And I don't think about how many factories I have building gasoline engines. Now, I know that if I flip that, that you can ask \u2013 you're asking a really smart question, which is, can you leverage capabilities at Ford? And absolutely, we can. That's something that you will expect. And you'll go what's an example right now? Just think of the early investment we made in Chariot, that's a Transit platform that we know a lot about, as we build the ride-hailing and ride-sharing service ideas, and we're learning about users in those kinds of experiences that can backward integrate in the way people just experience the Transit when they're not sharing it. So, there's lots of synergies in the future back to what we've already understood about our business. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. Look forward to hearing more about those opportunities. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Your line is open. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just maybe shifting gears to South America, it does look, it looked like you've narrowed your losses a bit year-to-date on plan with your guidance. But I was hoping you could give us a little bit of a better view of how you are thinking about the second half in South America. Where your breakeven levels there are? And what the path there is to get back to profitability for Ford in that region? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Itay. Good morning. The path is really going to be around what I touched on, when we were going through the section, which is the recovery of the industry firstly and the consumers. So, when we look at the second half of the year, we expect to see substantially better results on a year-over-year basis than what we saw in the first half of the year. And much of that's going to be driven on the back of the industry, a little bit of mix, but also some pricing without too much impact of exchange based on how we see the market right now. And cost being very, very well controlled with some inflation getting through, but very well controlled. As we move forward, I think and as momentum continues in the economic recovery, again the leverage effect, I think it's going to really flow through quite quickly. And then what the team also is working on of course is product. We need to make sure that we've got a very robust and exciting product portfolio and in fact later this year, we're going to be launching the EcoSport, the mid-cycle change on that which has been a very successful product there. And we'll also have coming a mid-cycle change on the Ka, which is in the highest volume segment in the region. So, those are the things that I think we're going to have to build on for product portfolio and bring more customers into the showrooms from that point of view and our team is working on that. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. And then maybe a follow-up for Jim. As you go through your 100-day review, can you talk a little bit more about the revenue opportunities that you are looking at? And also, maybe how Ford's investments in Big Data kind of play into some of the opportunities both within revenue and fitness that you described on slide 3? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, you led me to that answer in the knowledgeable way that our GDIA helps us \u2013 this is an important thing that was invested in that's really been worth its value. So it helps us understand demand in a lot more granular way, it helps us understand pricing, it's going to help us understand pricing even better. So, right now, we're looking as I mentioned in my comments, the relationship between mix and pricing is where the revenue opportunities are. That's probably as much as I want to share about it, because it's competitive, but there is opportunity there. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: And maybe I can just give you an example of what Jim was talking about, Itay. For example, GDIA for quite some time \u2013 we're probably most progressed in the U.S. in terms of their ability to help guide us in terms of how we play volume versus mix versus incentives versus types of incentives, the effectiveness of the marketing, the fixed marketing, the advertising sales promotion, so we've got tremendously strong data and starting to move to the point where we can actually understand individual customers, not just the broader market, but individual customers. But one of the good examples and this plays a bit to what we've seen unfold across the industry, but perhaps more so at Ford, which is around the cars. As we've looked at the data, and we've looked at our own data and we've looked at the competitors, there's just not much elasticity on the cars. So, we can put more variable on that. It's not going to do anything other than we spend more variable. So, that has enabled us to kind of pull back a bit. And in fact I think in the second quarter, we pulled back on our incentives in an absolute sense, much less than increase for the industry on cars, if I remember correctly. And we've been able to take those funds, and we have been able to allocate them to other segments and specific vehicle lines combined with an aligned advertising sales promotion approach, but also Tier 2 marketing by the dealers and Tier 3, to be very aligned and very powerful around where we know the most elasticity is, and really drive hard. So, that I think has saved us incentives and it's probably given us some off the mix effect that we've had, it's also I think given us a clear view about the real underlying strength of the car business in general, but ours specifically. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks so much for all that detail. Operator : Thank you. We will take one more analyst and then we will switch to the news media. Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine from Consumer Edge Research. Derek J. Glynn - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Derek Glynn on for Jamie. Jim, in your view, can the success of emerging opportunities be complementary to the success of the core business or is this inversely related? And similarly, recognizing it's still early days since the investment in Argo AI, what are your views on the strategic vision for that entity and the role it could play going forward? Thanks. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, the important secret in this, Derek, is that humans are in both of those models. People use the products in the historic understanding of our industry and that's our target obviously in the future. Even though and I am being a little facetious, but even though there is robots in the future, right, as you're targeting about with Argo AI, so the robots are only going to be as effective as how they serve the humans. This is a distinct position that I am taking and I think there's going to be a difference in the way Ford thinks about it. So, Bill Ford and I had a really intimate discussion about this when I started in the board. Then later, which is \u2013 the history of the company is evolving itself over this long-lived life and not thinking about that it's in a regressive way unable to leave the last phase to the new. I mean, we just got to do what we have to do to win and be successful in the future. What tends to happen, you are hearing me preach here a little bit, is we over-romanticize that future. We over-dramatize. Bill Gates used to say you overestimate the arrival and you underestimate the impact of these technologies. So, we have to get ready for how disruptive they are, but they probably aren't as soon as everybody is writing about them. We're ready though, we're going to be ready. And so, Argo was an investment in that area. John Casesa, our Head of Strategy, helped put this together and it was a really innovative idea, because to get that kind of talent inside Ford, the configuration of the entity in Pittsburgh allows us to have them be us and them be them. They can be both together. It probably wasn't known as deeply as you can read about today, is the deep learning ,is a phase of artificial intelligence that's recent. It's only three years really in its awareness. And deep learning is kind of the special pixie dust the way these things are going to really perform. The ability to do that is what we're targeting with Argo AI to bring that capability into Ford. There's very few firms in the world creating what we're talking about that have this capability. And so, that promise is something that we have to come and show you, but it's situating us really well to be ahead in that game eventually. We're not there yet. I wouldn't say we're number one, but we're at the top of the people working on this technology. As we go into the media discussions, someone is going to ask me to calibrate that, but you just \u2013 you got to trust the way machine learning has evolved. There are differences. There is kind of elite kind of players in it and then others that are kind of good at it. We're going to be in that elite level with this capability. Derek J. Glynn - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. That's very helpful. Operator : We will now take questions from the news media. Your first question comes from the line of Dee-Ann Durbin with The Associated Press. Dee-Ann Durbin - The Associated Press : Thank you for taking the call. Bob, a quick one. What's the update on the buyout offers? Are you getting what you need and if you don't get what you need, do you then consider layoffs? And, Jim, another quick one. Just your take on Ford stock price and what it's going to take to move the needle to kind of get past the cycle fears that investors just can't seem to get over? Thanks. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Thanks, Dee-Ann. So, on the first one, based on the latest that I have seen, it's progressing well. I think they have until sometime later this month, someone's saying today. Today? To self-select. So we'll have to see what the final numbers are, but I've been told it's going well. Just for the analysts on the call, we will reflect any separation cost associated with that in the third quarter as a special item. Don't know what that number is, but we'll report it in the third quarter. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And regarding, Dee-Ann, the share price, there is no CEO in the world that doesn't understand that that currency is not only how they are compensated, their teams are compensated, but is the scorecard for how well things are going. But the way I think about that, it's a consequence. It's not a leading indicator. So this share price today does not reflect the team's activities that I believe we're going to embrace and deliver to you. So that has to happen with dispatch and more importantly what Bob and I talk about, Bill and I talk about is reliability where you expect things from us and that we build trust in the way we create value. I've been in the business, been around CEOs that have that kind of command and so I long for that and that's my pitch that the share price over time is going to reflect what we're able to get done and we plan on getting a lot done. Dee-Ann Durbin - The Associated Press : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Snavely with Detroit Free Press. Brent Snavely - Detroit Free Press, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking the question here. I'm wondering, as the industry goes through this very big trend of car sales declining, as SUV, crossover, and pickup sales increase, if your review of capital allocation \u2013 I mean, if you're looking at car lines and if there are cars in the U.S. get risk of being eliminated as you add SUV models? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I'm looking to Bob because \u2013 and as I came into the job, I knew we were in the middle of that. So I want to confirm we do. That is one of the leadership responsibilities. And there's been some decisions that have been in the air, so to speak, but I'm going to let you... Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yes. I think, Brent, what you're talking about is consumers are moving away from passenger cars into utilities and trucks. They've been doing that for quite a long time. They've been doing that not just here, but in all the major markets of the world. And there is no sign that trend is going to continue. So we will be responding to what the customers want. That's around the \u2013 the guidance we have already provided is around investing more in utilities and investing more in trucks. But in some markets and for some reasons, cars will continue to be important. We're just going to be very thoughtful about the amount of investment that we make there and make sure that it gives us an appropriate return. So I think two examples that demonstrate that is the decision around the Focus, so we will still provide a Focus to customers in North America. But we're going to do that in a way that's very capital efficient and saved us $1 billion versus what we had expected. And we'll do so in a way that gives us a better return than what we would have done if we've just continued on the path that we had been on. And we're going to look at all the individual vehicle lines with a very critical lens as we go forward, because we've got to make a return on that investment. Another example is in Europe, the B-MAX. The B-MAX is a small multi-utility vehicle in a segment that's declining and we're going to be discontinuing that. That's going to be replaced by the EcoSport to be built in the Craiova plant, which is going to be much higher volume and it's exactly what consumers want. It's a very big growing segment. So we're going to do that type of activity right across the portfolio everywhere in the world in response to what consumers want and our desire to get an appropriate return. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And, Brent, to add, you know the utility mix in the company is high. That continues and we're adding, of course, the Ranger and the Bronco coming. There is other ideas that are coming in that category. For those who wonder, are you worried about over time that as fuel, let's say, starts to shift again or there is a different conscience about utilities, that's why Ford's investment in these aluminum understructures was so prescient. That's why our ability to put hybrid and other kind of Powertrains is going to be really important. And so let's just make an investment in this category that's been very profitable for us and future proof it a little bit because of the way we're thinking about their performance over time. Brent Snavely - Detroit Free Press, Inc.: Is there any way you can speed up getting Ranger and Bronco to the market and EcoSport or is that schedule sort of baked in at this point? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, you've to come and help me twist arms. I'd take it as soon as I can. But the rigor of getting this done right, I think, is the thing I'll lean into. We got to do it the right way. So it's getting all the attention that it deserves to get here at the right price, right time kind of equation. Brent Snavely - Detroit Free Press, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Christiaan Hetzner with Automotive News. Christiaan Hetzner - Automotive News : Yes. Many thanks for taking my question. I need just one to ask really quickly. What your views were about Europe in particular, in terms of the number of brands competing, the complexity in the market, the role of diesel, upcoming CO2 emissions targets and, of course, Brexit. How do you view the region? Is it something that over the long-term remains attractive for you? And, secondly, very quickly about the Fiesta launch. How important is the Brexit effect in that, given that that is the most important market \u2013 the most important car in that market for Ford? Thank you. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, let me start and then I'll give it to Bob to add precision, because this is something I think about a lot. I think, every \u2013 by the way, every CEO that competes in Europe in all industries have stepped back. The industry that I was in before this had similar kinds of challenge to compete there. What's top of mind for me is how strong the Ford brand is there. So when you witness other things that have happened in our industry, the Ford brand is highly regarded. I've learned the Mustang, for example, I think, last year, Joe was number one sales in Europe, I mean \u2013 and that was a decision by us to take that to market and look how well it did. So, there is reinforcement over and over again. Jim Farley, who just came to head up all the markets for us, was just in-charge of that for the last three years. And we're able to make that profitable. And we can \u2013 now Brexit was a twist in that. I don't think any of us saw that I mean, if you were thinking of predictive kind of exercises, the kind of things we're going right now. We did not sit as a management team and say, hey, Brexit's going to happen and therefore your footprint's going to be under pressure. But we're business people. So, we're accepting that and we're deliberately now thinking about how to play to win there. But I want you to know, we're in Europe. I mean, Ford can be really successful there. We've got great response to the Fiesta. I'll let Bob tell you about that. And so, I'm bullish on it, but that we've got to address the issues that come from Brexit. And the mobility play, as it had all this promise, and it means lots of things to different people has a real attraction in Europe. There's some things there that we see them as early adopters of that we're trying to leverage. So, I want to leave the message that Europe is a place we're going to be. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: So, the only thing I would add is that we do see opportunity for the Fiesta as I touched on earlier. It's our highest volume product. It's the fabulous product that we're bringing to the market. And clearly, it's going to give us an opportunity in 2018 and in the latter part of this year. I think a couple of other points to think about, I mean PSA and even our own performance has demonstrated that one can make profits in Europe, now what we have to do is make better returns in Europe and certainly we're very focused on that, although to be frank, probably the type of return that you get in Europe, won't be what it is in the United States because of the structure of the market and competitiveness, the products and so forth. But we do believe that we can get an appropriate return in Europe. The other point I would make is around Russia. There is Europe and there is Russia, and Russia clearly, we believe has the opportunity to first grow, to potentially be the largest individual market within Europe but also to give us very good returns. Although recognizing that will be more cyclical than probably the underlying European business itself. So we still feel a lot of excitement about Europe. We're very committed to Europe. We think we can get the appropriate returns in Europe. We are all in and we are working to improve the business in response to the curveball that Jim just mentioned around Brexit. Christiaan Hetzner - Automotive News : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew DeBord with Business Insider. Matthew DeBord - Business Insider : Good morning. Two quick questions for Jim. First is Jim, if you could just give us possibly a specific example the Ford product in which you're applying some of the systemic design thinking that you spoke of earlier in the call? And then second question is about Silicon Valley, if you think Silicon Valley is in trouble, as far as the transportation and mobility initiatives go and might need victory at this point, might need the traditional car business to show it the way to bring some kind of value monetize some of these opportunities? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yes. And, Matthew, let me take the first one first. The AV is a perfect candidate for the techniques that you hear me talk about and for all kinds of reasons, just a highlight for you because we can look back with perfect hindsight and say, who were the leaders in the computer industry Commodore, Atari, Digital, at the time when I was young and PCs were starting to come out, IBM came later. And all four of them weren't going to win and most of what the history will show us was the use evolution of the science happened too late. So I'm trying to bring the discipline that says this technology is coming really fast and we've got to make it people centered very early if in our way of winning, so. So let's use that, the leverage of that is as I look at your second question, I don't \u2013 I would never -- it would be arrogant for me to say the valley is in trouble in any kind of regard, kind of work that's created out there and value for shareholders. But I think you've heard me say a few times, I don't think we have to cede the future of the transportation to them, in ways that Ford isn't here. I just don't believe that. And I've been saying this in meetings I have had with analyst and press that they may need us more than we need them, because the export of software is not as difficult as the export of the vehicle constructs that we've learned. These vehicles have to protect people, save lives and have to perform in extreme conditions. And so, that stuff, we have a lot of awareness about. The concern that anyone would have is we, are we, were we asleep at the switch that we didn't understand them coming; of course, we do. In fact, there is Ford people that have been recruited into some of those businesses. So I'd like the \u2013 I'd like the challenge of trying to prove to everybody that this technique I'm talking about our capabilities married together, make us a really good player in the future. Matthew DeBord - Business Insider : All right. Sure. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back to Jim Hackett for closing remarks. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yes. So I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. I appreciate you being patient with me as I start the 100 days, I want you to know, every day I get up, I think about clarity and focus in delivering, understanding about where we are going and so we look forward to meeting you in the fall with more information. Operator : This concludes the Ford Motor Company earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Dorothy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford Motor Company Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations for Ford Motor Company. Please go ahead. Lynn Antipas Tyson - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, Dorothy. Good day and welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's third quarter 2017 earnings review. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO, and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Jim will begin with a brief review of our strategy and operating performance and then Bob will review the quarterly results in more detail.

James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, thank you, Lynn. And, Lynn, welcome to your first call as Head of Investors Relations at Ford Motor Company. We're lucky to have you. Lynn Antipas Tyson - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And good day to everyone on the phone. On October 3, I had the opportunity to meet with many of you and lay out our winning aspiration for the Ford Motor Company. Now, I'm not going to read it verbatim here, but the spirit of it is that we are marrying the trust of our brand that it has earned over time with the passion that people have for creating and owning great cars and trucks with a commitment to transforming our business to win in the future. We are fully embracing an evolution brought on by the intersection of powerful computing concepts and the ability to development intelligent capabilities in our vehicles. And these vehicles won't be working in isolation, rather they'll be interacting with an independently smart world. We describe our strategy as smart vehicles in a smart world. And I will often return to this theme in future discussions about our company. For us, this means that we have a clear path to leverage what we've done well historically as we move toward this optimistic future. Now, our approach is to link what we know now with what we imagine the future to be. And we're bridging the two in a way that satisfies our customers and provides a clear roadmap for investors. The first priority that I told you about was to reset revenue and attack costs in the near term, and our results this quarter demonstrate that we've embraced the deep commitment to making our company more fit. And we're also fundamentally redesigning our operations, that's the longer-term effort, in reallocating capital to where we can win in the future. As you can see from our framework, here on slide three, fitness is really at the heart of our plan. Now on future calls, I will update you on key milestones as evidence of how we are evolving. And I just want to reaffirm that I know you're looking for specifics here. If you turn to slide four, I'm proud of the efforts of the team to deliver a solid 2017 and pleased with results we achieved this quarter. We've already significantly reduced costs and we have accelerated plans to introduce smart, connected vehicles and services. We've made a number of decisions in that vein. We're continuously innovating to create the most human-centered mobility solutions. And our team is empowered to make decisions and work together effectively. As I say, to compete and win. And I can assure you that we're committed to transforming our business. Well, let me just mention a few highlights from the quarter before I turn it over to Bob. We successfully launched new products around the world, such as the new F-150. You already knew about that, but I want to reaffirm that it's already delivering higher transaction prices. We also saw good performance by North America, with an operating margin over 8%. We also saw a record third quarter profit in Asia-Pacific and another strong result at Ford Credit. We reached important agreements with potential partners in India and in China that can help us improve our business in those critical markets. These are markets you ask about often. We launched collaborations with Dominos using our AV technology and Lyft we advanced our work on autonomous vehicles that can move both people and goods in the future. Well, clearly we have a lot of work ahead of us. But this is a solid quarter, and I want to smile with the results today because we're going to build on this as we move forward. And now, I'd like to hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Shanks. Bob? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Jim. Well, as Lynn mentioned earlier, I don't plan to go through any slides today. Instead, before going to Q&A, I'm going to share remarks that provide our perspective on the quarter's highlights along with a few key facts that you might have missed if you haven't had a chance to go through the material yet that we filed earlier this morning. So as Jim said, we delivered a solid quarter with more balanced results including year-over-year improvements in growth, profitability and cash flow. Let me provide a few highlights. First, our company adjusted pre-tax profit was $2.2 billion (7:00). That was up 40% from a year ago and that was driven by gains in both our Automotive and our Financial Services segments. Now, within our Automotive segment, we saw profit of $1.7 million which was up 54%, and that was due mainly to lower cost, but we also saw favorable market factors that are more than explained by higher net pricing. Our automotive operating margin was 5%. That was up 1.7 points, and we achieved this despite the commodity cost increases of over $300 million. Within Automotive, our profit was driven by solid performance at North America, where we earned $1.7 billion, which was up 33%. The operating margin was 8.1% and that was up 2.3 points. The year-over-year gain of over $400 million was achieved through favorable cost performance of over $700 million which was inclusive of commodity cost increases of about $200 million. In addition, the results were achieved with less than 1,000 wholesales for the high-margin Expedition and Navigator, which were in launch. And, in fact, we didn't wholesale any of the new product; those were all old product. By comparison, we wholesaled about 19,000 of these products in the third quarter last year. Now, outside of North America in the Automotive segment, results were about breakeven. This included a record third quarter profit in Asia-Pacific of $289 million, more than doubling what we did last year, with an operating margin of 7.9%, which was up 3.6 points. Like North America, favorable cost performance drove the profit gain. I'd also note that the year-over-year improvement was driven by operations outside China, and, in particular, Australia and India. On the other hand, we saw a loss in Europe of $86 million, which was our first loss since the first quarter of 2015. This was nearly completely explained by Brexit effects but also affected by higher commodity costs along with the Fiesta launch effects. We expect to return to profitability in Europe in the fourth quarter and, of course, for the full year. Higher volume will drive the return to profitability. We expect production in Europe to be 116,000 units higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter and 65,000 units higher than it was in the fourth quarter of 2016. Finally, Ford Credit turned in another strong quarter, earning $600 million, which was up 6%. Favorable volume and mix along with lease residual performance drove the profit improvement. Ford Credit also made a distribution to its parent in the quarter totaling $378 million. FICO Scores remained strong, and our origination, servicing and collections practices continued to be disciplined and consistent. As noted, we continue to see higher auction values than we had expected, and, as a result, we now expect three-year auction values for full-year 2017 on average to be down about 3% from 2016 at constant mix. As you'll recall, in both the first and the second quarters, we expected that decline to be about 6%. The operating results from Automotive and Ford Credit coupled with an adjusted operating tax rate of 11.8% contributed to a 63% increase in net income to $1.6 billion and an adjusted EPS of $0.43, which was up $0.17. Our Automotive operating cash flow was negative $1.7 billion, which was an improvement from a year ago. The negative results were due to unfavorable timing and other differences along with working capital, mainly payables. We continue to expect cash flow to be positive for the full year, although lower than 2016, which is consistent with our prior guidance. Our balance sheet remains strong and investment grade and we ended with cash over $26 billion and liquidity at $37 billion. So, with the improvement in our operating performance and traction against cost initiatives, we're fully confident in our ability to deliver on our previous guidance. And, in fact, today we're tightening that guidance to a range of $1.75 to $1.85, which is the upper half of the prior guidance. And, within this, we're raising our target for Ford Credit profit before tax to be above $2 billion. The adjusted effective tax rate remains at about 15%, which is unchanged from prior guidance. So overall, for us, a good, high-quality quarter for Ford and a down payment on our efforts to improve our overall fitness. So, with that, I'd like to turn it back to the operator, who will get us started on our Q&A session. Operator? Operator : Your first question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Good morning, and thanks for taking our questions here. Let me just follow-up first on the Ford Motor Credit. You're taking your auction values from down 6% to down 3%. Curious to what you're thinking about for next year. I think the auto ecosystems improved from some of the hurricane recovery-related demand. But wondering what your view is for the fourth quarter for residual values and, again, moving into 2018 and 2019 where we still have off-lease vehicles coming back en masse. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, David. I'll take that one. And let me just give a general comment first. We're going to stay away from guidance for 2018, but where I think it's appropriate and we can, we'll provide some, maybe some texture and color. And I think we can do that in response to your question. So, clearly, we've seen much better performance this year than what we had expected. We are still writing new contracts on an assumption that auction values will be lower. But I have to say that we expect them to not be quite as low as what we had thought previously. So our outlook has improved with regard to auction values moving forward. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Got it. And then, Jim, from an execution standpoint looks like a pretty good quarter from materials. Obviously you were lapping some headwinds last year from a warranty perspective. Fourth quarter you'll see some more warranty headwinds that were announced earlier. Do you think that the company has passed a lot of these one-time field service actions that you've seen so far this year and in last year? What is being done to address that from a manufacturing perspective? And is the warranty expense accrual that you're now booking appropriate, or does the level need to increase? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I want to tell you it looks like a good quarter, it is one. And I'm not parsing words, but I'm really happy with the quarter because in the 100-plus days scanning through the company, there's definite improvements that show up in the financial performance. But I'm seeing things underneath. I hinted about them in my comments. For example, our decision-making, what we call role clarity in terms of [pf] who owns points of view (14:18). You'll recall in the organization that we've established we've linked under Joe Hinrichs our manufacturing with quality with procurement with product development with our FCSD group. And the premise with that organizational shift was that it would make the system more connected and linked relative to the design and execution of the product. So, I'm not sitting on any news that there's something about to go over a cliff from a quality perspective. So I'm optimistic that the changes that we're making are going to show those improvements. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. And just the last one for me is, as I think about we're headed into next year, your competitor is going through a large pickup truck refresh. A couple of years ago, you went through one as well. There was an opportunity for them to really take market share. Do you think about 2018 and the market backdrop where your competitors are as a real good opportunity to push the F-150 and take more retail share? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, it's one of those gifts that keeps on giving for us. And so you answered part of the question. So, we witnessed F-150 transaction prices increase in the face of the kind of competitive activity that you referenced. So we think we're in a really good position. The Super Duty is doing extremely well, and we had counted on that. And so we're very happy with that franchise. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks for taking our questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question is just about the guidance range. So, just backing into the implied total company pre-tax profit from the EPS guide, it seems to be $8.2 billion to $8.7 billion or $500 million range. I appreciate that's narrowed significantly from more like a $900 million range in the back half prior, but still it's a little large. So, I'm just curious if you can share why the range of guidance? What are the swing factors that you are thinking about that might cause you to potentially track more toward the low or the high ends of that range. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, I'll take that one, Ryan. What we do when we provide that, we go back and look at history in terms of what parts of the business have moved and to what degree from this point in time to the end of the year. And, frankly, it's all over the place. It could be around wholesales, it could be around production, it could be around recalls. We just had a question on that. Although we have picked up everything that we're aware of right now with that 8-K that we issued recently. It could be variable marketing. But we think we what we see in front of us is \u2013 exchange I guess is another one as well, particularly around balance sheet effects. We have launches underway, although I think we're coming out of those. So, I think we feel pretty comfortable. So, I don't see anything that suggests we're going to swing either one way or the other. But we just try to provide the range that's based on what our experience has been. And I can certainly say, obviously, that we're working to deliver the strongest possible result that we can and we feel very good coming off of the third quarter results. But we're comfortable with the guidance. We feel very confident about it. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. And then just a last question from me is on South America. The losses, they are materially lower than they were a year ago, but they're still pretty material. I appreciate the cycle is at a low point and you're on track to, I'm sure, make a profit when the volumes return. But just given the magnitude of the losses incurred there in recent years and maybe the slower return to profit in the region relative to some of your competitors with larger market share and maybe even given the success of some of the newer entrants like Hyundai in Brazil, et cetera, just curious if you're thinking any differently at all about what you need to do long term strategically in that market, like, I don't know, maybe an alliance with another automaker, like you'd had with Volkswagen in the 1990s, or maybe to selectively exit certain markets or anything like that. Thank you. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, thanks, Ryan. In some of the discussions that are public today, I want to address that I get questions from October 3 about where the specifics are to the detail and strategy story that we've laid out. And I want you to understand there are a number of things when you're talking about the smart vehicle smart world, that in 100 days, we're working really hard to conceptualize and imagine the implications of that. And then there are real things coming from us about that strategy. Then I would put in another pile issues like what you just talked about, that in the 100 days warrant attention, warrant attention in ways that you just talked about, in the nature of the investment, the nature of relationships, the nature of the markets, the nature of the history. And we've made a lot of progress in a couple of these areas. So, I'm not announcing anything today. But I just want to confirm that I don't want you to heap all of these unanswered questions in the same pile. And in a pile where, I believe, direction from us and point of view is what I use the term inside the company \u2013 is one that we're coming to grips with and will have a position on same. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everybody. First question. Does Ford need a restructuring? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: I need you to ask that a second way, Adam. What do you mean by that? Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sometimes when you have big changes of strategy, big management changes and fundamental pivots in the direction of the organization long term, when you reassess fitness, in this industry at least, there's quite a lot of precedence of restructuring actions, be it asset write-downs, head count adjustments, et cetera. Does Ford need anything like that? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I think I'd stand with the comments I gave you in October which is that Ford is getting itself in a better position in the future. And we've undertaken two different tracks or two different kind of streams that are really time sensitive. One is the near-term things, and that's what the top-left of the diagram is showing you, that we've attacked revenue and cost in this 2017 working on 2018 period, and we created six work streams that are about redesigning the business operations. That work has been assigned. It's coming bottoms up. Very excited about what I've seen earlier. And so, I plan on reporting to you as the news in that area starts to present itself. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Adam, if I can just add before, if going to another question. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: So, I read your thoughtful commentary... Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: ...around restructuring. So, I would say, in addition to what Jim said, nothing specific related to the $10 billion of material cost reductions or the $4 billion of engineering. But I think when you think about the fitness paradigm that Jim talked to in New York, the reset and the redesign. Redesign means a substantial change to the business. How we do what we do and who we do it with and so forth. So, I think in that bucket and consistent with what we've said since 2010, we will aggressively restructure the business as required to achieve the objectives that we've set out to achieve. So, nothing specific and certainly nothing related to those two big improvements we talked about in New York. But we're always open and prepared to do what we have to do. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you, Bob. Just a follow-up. What are the arguments for and against a carve-out or separation of Ford Smart Mobility LLC into a separate, potentially publicly traded company? Can you argue it from both sides? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: I think that the biggest advantage I could have one day is when you see the growth of that segment of our business such that you want to ask that question. And so it's one of the things that it's got to deliver on its promise and we've had really a lot of good things started there, but it isn't at the scale yet where it has any kind of that implication yet. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. If I can just sneak in one more. Your bonds have rallied hard. There's a saying in business, either you don't want to raise capital when you have to. You want to do it when you don't have to. Is this a good opportunity to sock-in some margin of safety to insure against a force majeure, uncertainty around the economic environment particularly at a time of strategic change? That's my final question. Thank you. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, we actually did that. Relatively recently, we took out a loan of nearly $3 billion because we felt, to your point, that was a good time. We thought rates were going to be going up and we thought the balance sheet could take that. It's part of the cash we're holding right now, and we intend to use that for strategic purposes. But beyond that, no, I don't see the need at the moment to do that. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Oh, man. They gave us some limitations here. I want a clarification and a question. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, we still love you, Rod. If you can put all of it in one paragraph, maybe that works. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I will try to keep it simple. But just the clarification part is just dividing by your tax rate, like looking at the new guidance divided by your tax rate, it looks like you raised your guidance by a few hundred million dollars. Your Financial Services guidance is now greater than $2 billion versus the $1.5 billion previously. So just to clarify, is the guidance change basically the improvement in the Financial Services outlook? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, the tax rate is the same, as I think you noted. But Financial Services had been moving up over the course of the year actually. It's now at a point where we're \u2013 and we're towards the end of where we're declaring that. But overall, if I look at what we're going to be delivering for the company versus what we had expected, we'll be doing better than we had expected in Ford Credit, not quite as good in Automotive. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then texture. I know you're not giving guidance for 2018, but you did provide some texture around some of the big picture things we should be thinking about. I would think that, for North America, a key driver is going to be the Expedition and Navigator launch and whatever you're able to achieve on costs. How should we be thinking about those things? And I'm just thinking back to the Super Duty launch. There was a big volume increase, you had a significant increase in content costs, so that mitigated some of the positives. And on the cost side, can you give us some brackets around what we should be thinking? Obviously, you've got some non-recurrence of warranty. But is there any big brackets that you can talk about for potential cost performance next year? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: I think I'll take a pass on that, other than to say obviously the focus that you've seen on costs and the evidence of that in the quarter, the conversation around fitness, so we'll be providing more proof points on that as we move through the year. I have to say that we still see, as we look ahead at the moment to next year, we still see commodity prices going up when we look at the forward curves. So, that is something that we'll have to mitigate as we look at next year. We have some significant launches around the world. I would note that in the case of Europe, something like 80% of the volume that we wholesale next year in Europe will be new product, so there's going to be a really strong year for Europe. And, of course, we've got launches elsewhere. And then I mentioned Ford Credit. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And I would add, Rod, that the Expedition, Navigator launches are a go. Everything's good there, ready to roll. So, just confirming that that's still the plan. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: When you've launched those new products in the past, very often there's been significant increases in costs that have offset some of the positives that you get from transaction prices and so forth. And so far, what we're seeing in terms of your cost structure, some of it is the non-recurrence of charges that you had last year. So, I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you're actually seeing some significant progress in terms of the cost structure on a go-forward basis? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, well, let's just look at the quarter. So, of that $700 million, $200 million is material cost excluding commodities. About $100 million or so is engineering, about $100 million is advertising sales promotion. So the majority is those factors, we did have the non-repeat of the recall. But to me, that means that we're back towards a more normal ongoing level of cost performance, and that's how I would think about this quarter. This quarter, as I mentioned earlier, is really high quality in terms of there not really being anything unusual, good or bad, that I look at. I think this is a really good view of the business on a run-rate basis, recognizing we've got some launch effects in there both probably good and bad. And the other thing, too, going back to next year \u2013 and I want to come back to the question, I can't remember if it was David or Ryan that asked about it, but let's not forget that we've just launched a new F-150 as well. And that's off to a very, very strong start. And already as we look early in October, that we're seeing transaction prices that are holding up which is not necessarily what I expected, I thought, once we started lapping Super Duty \u2013 it is getting tougher, no doubt. But we are seeing some good performance so far. And then of course, we've got a new Mustang coming as well, which is always a big event. So, I think we've got some good things that are going to help us as we move ahead into next year. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Good morning. I'll try to limit myself to one question and a clarification as well. The first real question, the question really is, I can understand on a first derivative basis how better realization of residuals at auctions helps Ford Motor Credit. But, Bob, I just wonder if you can talk about what that really means for new vehicle pricing, because down 6% on resids versus down 3% should mean a lot for new vehicle pricing. I'm just curious if you saw a benefit from that in new vehicle pricing in the quarter or that's on the come for what you expect that to mean going forward. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, this is something that we've all talked about isn't it? There is a relationship between what's happening with auction values and the pressure or lack thereof in terms of new vehicle prices. So I think that the way that we think about it, that I would encourage you to think about it is the fact that we're not seeing the decline to be as precipitous as we thought, should make it a bit easier for us to do better in terms of new vehicle prices going forward. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Okay. And was that a factor in the quarter as far as pricing on the new vehicle side? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: I can't say that directly, but the fact that it hasn't been as bad as what we had thought earlier in the year, I think probably has been a positive for us. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then the one quick clarification. The $14 billion cost saves target you have going forward, should we assume the bulk of that is going to be reinvested in the business for future tech and development? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, no. In fact, I would expect the bulk of that to be flowing through to the bottom line. That will generate \u2013 if your question is around what are we going to do with the cash that it generates, we are clearly reallocating capital, both within the traditional business to the areas where we know we've got a winning proposition and a winning hand. And then we talked about in New York, Jim talked about the fact that we're going to be seeing less investment than we had planned or done in the past on ICEs and that would be giving us the ability to accelerate and invest more in EVs. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And, John, I would just remind you in the role that digital services play in that Smart Vehicle, Smart World, that's a much lower capital appetite kind of business. OpEx can be higher because of some of the software, but margins are better, too. John Murphy - Bank of America- Merrill Lynch : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. Any color on Asia-Pac? I mean, you look at the China joint venture profit seemed to have gone down quite significantly. But when I pull that out, the core ops seemed to have improved quite dramatically. What are the drivers and how should we think about, one, the China joint venture profits? And is this sort of consolidated Asia-Pac a sustainable number now? Because it looks like it's back to a positive number. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I think I'm going to ask Bob for some history with this, but I would just tell you that Jim Farley's assignment to oversee all the global markets and our leader in Asia-Pacific, Peter Fleet, they have really attacked what I would say is the fitness in China as part of our overall effort. And some significant actions are being taken there. And so, I'm optimistic about your inference that says that there's sustainability in the offing. I've got to pair that with the knowledge that in the time that you all have been covering China and Automotive, there's a lot more indigent (32:57) competitors there, and so pricing pressures and things like that are going to follow as well. But, Bob, what would you add? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah. I would just add I guess a couple of things. One is, you're right that the improvement year-over-year is driven by the consolidated operations outside of China. And the thing that encourages me about that is not too long ago we're talking about the need to restructure or improve those businesses. That's been incredibly successful, and it's not just Australia, India, I mentioned, ASEAN, Taiwan, New Zealand, South Korea. I mean, it's pretty broad-based. So, I feel fantastic about what the team was able to do as they set their focus on that and have done some really great things to achieve it. So, therefore, it gives me confidence as we look at China. As Jim says, it's a huge operation. And I think we see enormous opportunities to improve the overall business performance in Asia-Pacific by sustaining what we've delivered in the consolidated operations and really going after the opportunities that we have in China. I would also further add that I think it's towards the end of 2018 that we have a lot of new products starting to come. There's like the next cycle of products coming for China, which is going to really help as well. But we've got a lot of opportunities on the cost front and I would say the quality of our marketing efforts. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And if I could just squeeze in one follow-up question, kind of unrelated but... Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, let's just call it a clarification. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Well, can you clarify the cash flow? You've guided to it being down year-over-year, but year-to-date it's only $1.6 billion. What are the key drivers? I mean, unless we have a really strong Q4, or should we expect that to kind of get closer to that $6.4 billion in Q4? Or is there some issues this year that are dragging down cash? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: No. I think that's a good question. I think we're going to have a very strong fourth quarter. So, I don't expect to get up to the $6.4 billion that we achieved last year, but it's going to be much better than the $1.6 billion that we have year-to-date. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Just want to go back. And I know it's a theme that others have touched on, but a question/clarification. You've mentioned in the answer to one question about the work stream around it sounded like cost reduction, reengineering, the questions around that, too. Did I hear that right? Is that actual program office with cost-cutting goals, and is it rolling out across the business units? And, second, whether it is or isn't that kind of top-down programmatic effort where the engineering and spending and perhaps even some of the material saves we saw in North America related to a specific cost-cutting effort or was more timing of spends and hence we shouldn't extrapolate from that. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: You heard the first part right, Brian, in that, again, calling to mind this graphic on the screen we showed October 3, the fitness has two heads to it. There's a near-term and a longer term. You and I are talking about the longer-term effort we've identified and executives reporting to me directly. And this small team that I have that's running the whole company sits in terms of review. There's six work streams that have been identified and definite goals and targets for improvement. Now, you could ask a fair question is, okay, when are you going to give us that? The answer is, they're working on the design of the should-be state of these new ideas. So, think of the fitness as both a test of efficiency, but also effectiveness. So, the poster child I'm using publicly is the nature of the way enterprise computing systems drive factories and the way that configuration of products inform the factory about what to build, in companies of our age, those over time evolved into very complex systems in there. And so, if you were doing a start-up today, like, let's say an electric car company, you don't have the money for a system like that, so you buy a really simple order management system, and it's a lot leaner and it moves faster. So, what Ford has to do is stare back now at the history of that system and make it modern. And these are the kinds of things I know how to do and they create tremendous value in terms of reducing work-in-process capital, and they're going to improve warranty performance because of order errors and things like that. So, that's just a small example of what sits in the projects like that. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: My questions is is there also a short-term cost reduction work stream and program office that's looking for \u2013 I mean, for example, like the cost saves we saw in North America this quarter, or were those just timing things that were already underway? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt. That is explicit in the way that I'm describing these two approaches to fitness. So, there is a short-term effort; that's the reset that we're working on right now. You've seen the benefit this quarter. And there's, of course, things coming with the effort that both Jim Farley and Joe Hinrichs are applying here is why we had a quick turnaround in that effort. So, there's more to come there. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a follow-up on that last point, Jim and Bob. If we look at the lower structural cost in the quarter, which, I think you said is engineering and advertising, how much of that, I guess, was either already planned given the launch cadence, or just an easier comp versus having been reviewed since you started, Jim? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, it's a really good question, Joe. And I use a phrase in cost management called hold your breath, which means you can have a company this size where you just you just hold your breath for a quarter and then the costs aren't really gone. I want to get across that what we are working on here is the costs that don't return. With regard to some of the marketing spend, some of that is correlated to in Europe, where the product launch wasn't in sync. So, we didn't spend the money and we would have spent some of that money had we had the revenue match that was coming. But I am saying since I've gotten here and the team, I want to give a lot of credit, they're identifying areas where it's not hold your breath kind of work, where we can substantially recast what it costs us, both in efficiency and effectiveness to realize value. And what I want to do is I'm giving them the time to design those and then I want to bring those to you very quickly. I have a number of you that said the faster you can tell us what the value of that is, the more benefit that we see coming with Ford value creation. And I get that. And I know how to do this. And so, I'm going to warrant to you that your instincts are these are the kinds of things that we have to prove quarter to quarter. Your instincts are these the kinds of things that you're talking about, I am. I'm talking about things that we can sustainably return to you each quarter. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Joe, if I can just add something. One is that, and I think you touched on it. Your costs will be variable by quarter. It's what happens in a quarter; it's what happened a year ago in that quarter. So, they'll be variable by quarter. I just want to remind you to go back and look at the presentation that Jim gave in New York. The effort that he's talking about, at least through the business planning period, I would still expect in general cost trends to be going up, but we expect that curve to be much lower than what it was going to be otherwise. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just to follow on to that, and I think you mentioned earlier in terms of the guidance range change owing to Ford Credit. It would also appear then that was there some timing shift on the automotive side between the third and fourth quarter that came in a little bit differently than you had anticipated? And is that related to some of the cost conversation we just had? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, the most obvious thing is the announcement of the recall, and that was $300 million that we just disclosed that we didn't know about at the time of the second quarter call. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Galliers from Evercore. George Galliers - Evercore ISI : Yes. Good morning. And thank you for taking my question. On Tuesday, Mary Barra commented on their AV, saying she thought they'd be able to take the driver out in quarters not years. If they succeed, do you see that as a threat? And do you have data or good insight into where Argo and your autonomous programs are relative to Cruise? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: The way I choose to run the company is I think about what Ford can control and the way we think about our evolution in this space, and it's very good. The investment that we've made in Argo, substantial. They hit a high watermark yesterday in the number of employees that are on staff. And the talent that we've assembled is probably unheralded if you went back and looked at the number of different talents that they've recruited into that company. It's really a who's who. Came from a lot of the efforts that were adjacent and not as far along as reported. So, we have we have some sense of what the real evolution of this technology is. We're saying that in 2018, this is the key time for us in that we're bringing AVs into a test market as well. We haven't announced the city or the number of vehicles yet. And this is something that I brought up on October 3 is the question about are we in market in 2021, which was the last administration's position. And I said the way I want you to think about this is that the technology is evolving in a non-linear way. And as all you write about it, I see you trying to peg when is it fully smart. And think about that as a really elusive question. And because of that, the axis that corresponds with it is the markets that that technology will serve is an intersection of markets and technology. By the way, this has happened in the computing and smartphone world as well. They didn't evolve to their full capability in their first day in the market. So, the market applications correspondingly started in a narrow sense. Maybe some of the people that are talking about launching vehicles are going to be geo-fenced, without a driver I know in a regulatory sense isn't really possible yet. And so there's news in the media last night about some of the other claims about vehicles' ability to be driven without any involvement of driver or observation. It's all a caution that the evolution of this technology in the markets is something we're going to talk about quarter-after-quarter. So, let me summarize then by telling you I'm really happy in 100 days in my tour of this topic at Ford Motor Company. I remind you, 10 years ago we were one of the first DARPA participants, really the only OEM independently that was in that. You forget that we have test tracks all over the world, so we can be testing these vehicles continually, which we have. We're getting miles driven. And I've already mentioned the team that's being assembled to pull this off. So I want to check the box that AVs is not a question here at Ford at all. It's something that is really on track and I'm very confident about what it's going to do for the company. George Galliers - Evercore ISI : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from Guggenheim. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. On the clarification side, I wanted to ask you on your free cash flow. Can please go back over some of the drivers of this quarter's weak cash flow? It seems like you're highlighting some timing issues. And more importantly, what drives your conviction on the strong free cash flow expected in the fourth quarter? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. I'll take that one, Emmanuel. If you look at \u2013 I'm looking at slide 26. It's driven by a pretty large negative timing and other differences of $2.4 billion. Just under half of that is largely the difference between accruals and payments in areas such as warranty, marketing, compensation, pension and so forth. And that's just timing. We have a little bit of intercompany differences that are adjusted as well. There's some differences on cash taxes, there's some differences in terms of the timing of the reversal of JV profits and the dividends from them. So, it's a whole host of things and it's pretty unusual in terms of how large it is in the quarter. As we look ahead, we don't see that type of activity. And we see good profits. Working capital, we expect to improve. So, we expect a much stronger fourth quarter, as I said, than what we're seeing in the third quarter. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Understood. And then I guess, after this initial review that you've conducted of the company, do you feel that Ford's level of development cost towards mobility are appropriate, or do you think that they need to go higher? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I think they're appropriate. And I think that they're de minimis in the sense of the way they're tipping our earnings per share. But as I said a moment ago, we've made a big commitment to this program. We've announced the investment in Argo and we've announced work that we're doing in terms of tests in various cities. So, the cumulative effect of this is something that we'll continue to report on. I also wanted to add that, Emmanuel, in the last discussion about this, in a proof way that you think about our AV commitment, Ford has been very active in thinking about, as I talk about the market applications, you know about the Domino's test, but there's other things where we have business partnerships brewing and in development that are really new markets for us and new market opportunities for this technology where it solves some big problems. The world knows about ride hailing, but I don't think they were writing about pizza delivery, which is in excess of billions of dollars in terms of the kind of potential. Well, there's a lot more that's in the realm of applications of this technology in terms of in businesses. So, as I answer your question about how much is it going to cost to develop this capability with partnerships, you know that that's part of the advantage of the partnerships, that they will help us in that investment. And, of course, we get the reward of new markets. Emmanuel Rosner - Guggenheim Securities LLC : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Albertine from Consumer Edge. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to spend my question on a more strategic item. You've done a great job, I think, of laying out the emerging opportunities and as you see them with AVs and EVs and so forth. But what lacks for us and I was hoping you could help clarify, what's the vision for Ford Motor Credit's role in the next generation, if you will, of Ford Auto 2.0? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: I want to thank you for that question, Jamie, because, Joy, who runs Ford Credit, and I just had a discussion this week. And this is a part of our enterprise that just deserves a moment of applause because it's really well run. I sat on a bank board for a long time, so I understand the financial services cost structure and efficiencies and risk profile. It's very well run that way. But I'm probably as proud to know that they have thought about their business as FinTech, financial tech. And, of course, all the innovation that sits in the future about FinTech is the nature of the transaction structures. We read a lot about cryptocurrencies and things like that. But it's also the speed in which our customers can get financed, the speed in which we can deal with moving used vehicles around, et cetera, et cetera. So, Joy and the team have made a big commitment to that and have some early wins. We've been doing a number of tests, very small. But that's the great thing about this business. We can put this in the market. And there's some really good things that we're going to scale that we'll be sharing in the future. James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Excellent. Appreciate the color, and best of luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe I'll start with a quick clarification. Jim, you mentioned that Argo recently reached a milestone for employee staffing. Can you share the number of employees currently at Argo? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Nope. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. So, I'll move on to the next question. So, of the \u2013 going back to the $10 billion of material cost savings in the next five years, can you share how much of that $10 billion might be reinvested in variable cost or content in the vehicle that might show up as kind of materials ex-commodities that you could potentially price for? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, as we look at the impact that that has had as we've rolled it into our forward-year plans, the majority of that is flowing through to the bottom line. So, I think the way I would characterize the answer to your question is that we already had in our plan what we thought we needed in terms of product content, features, technology. In fact, if anything, I would say that's probably an opportunity because we may have too much or the wrong things or the right combination of things. And certainly that's a work stream that's underway to assess that. So you should think about the $10 billion as largely incremental opportunity to flow through to the bottom line. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar. David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Thanks. Good morning. My question is on Lincoln and the recent personnel changes. Kumar's role now being split between Lincoln and the broader CMO role. I was always under the impression that you wanted someone thinking about Lincoln 100% of the time and you were really stressing the Lincoln Motor Company brand coming back. So, is that changing at all? Is that your plan to have someone not be on Lincoln 100% of the time? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: David, this is Jim. That's a really fair question and you shouldn't assume that we've broken stride with that commitment. What I'd like about when you make changes like this and I like to turn the people, say, hey, we're running the company. You can do this any way you'd like. There's not a force that's pushing us in a direction that isn't our choice. In this case, our choice is to have Kumar retain ownership of that position as we then address how we want to sequence oversight. So, I want to give Jim Farley and Kumar time to do that. A part of that needs to be noticed. Kumar has done an extraordinary job in Lincoln's revival. We've hit new share marks with that. We have customer sat ratings that I don't think anyone in the industry would have believed in terms of some of the people, I want to give them credit, that used to kind of own top-tier rankings, and we've gone past them in some of the recent surveys. So the inside logic is we want to keep the stability of this, as Jim Farley, again, he's with me a little over 100 days, in building this whole part of our business over. So, don't assume that we've broke stride with that discipline. It's just work to be done there. David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. And just to clarify then. Are you saying on Lincoln going forward, are there going to be some more significant changes to strategy once Jim and Kumar have some more time? Or is it more keeping the course that was in place under Mark? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: I'm saying that it's really achieving much of the evolution that we were looking for. The luxury market shrunk in recent periods, and Lincoln gained share in that. Those are usually the most difficult times. So, I want to say that I'm really happy with that. But I also want to say having Jim Farley and Kumar compete and win, there's lots of things they still may want to do. And I want you to look at it as we're building credibility here in terms of the way we're managing that business. David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research): Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Jim Henry with Automotive News. Jim Henry - Automotive News : Hi. I had a Ford Credit-related question. I am clear that the long-term, or long to medium-term strategy, with regard to used car prices can change. You still expect used car values to go down. And you said earlier, we're writing contracts with the expectation that values are going to go down. How does one contrast this expectation that values are going to go down. I can make some educated guesses, but better coming from you. Is that thing like limiting extremely long-term contracts, that sort of thing? How do you do that? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: No. What I was saying is that in terms of what the auction values will be for lease contracts, we are assuming that the auction values will be declining, but not as much as what we had thought early in the year. So, our outlook, if you will, for that aspect of our business around leases and the lease-end values has improved from earlier this year. Jim Henry - Automotive News : So that means what? That you're able to set higher future residuals on leases that are originated now? I'm not sure whether this means that since used car values have hung in there for so long, have they begun to affect your future outlook? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, it has to the extent that we expect that decline to not be as steep as we had previously. But we do expect them to decline from where they are today at a constant mix. Jim Henry - Automotive News : Okay. All right. Thank you. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, Jim. Lynn, with the operator, I want to just end with some comments. If you all can turn to slide 32. I just want to recap the key highlights of our performance in this third quarter. And we do believe that we hit the solid quarter with more balanced results with improvements in growth, profitability and cash flow. Those are great indicators to point out. We do want you to see this as some of the questions today asked, are these hold-your-breath kind of things, or is this because you're becoming more fit? We believe they are indications of us improving our fitness. The balance sheet, of course, stays strong, growing stronger and substantial cash and liquidity. You hear the great news about Ford Credit. It's in great shape; it's got the right kind of reserves, it's earning the right kind of margins. It understands the residuals, as we've talked about. And we're fully confident in delivering the full-year guidance that Bob has adjusted today. So, once again, I want to thank everyone for joining us. And I look forward to continuing our dialogue about Ford Motor Company, our plans and our progress and to give you more specifics in the future. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes the Ford Motor Company fiscal 2017 third quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Ian, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford Motor Company Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please begin. Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, Ian. Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's fourth quarter and full-year 2017 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO, and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer.  Jim will begin with a brief review of our strategy and operating performance and then Bob will review the quarterly and full-year results in more detail. After Bob's section, we'll open the call up for questions. And following Q&A, Jim will have a few closing remarks. Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure in the Appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussion includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance. Actual results may vary and the most significant factors are included in our presentation. Also, all comparisons are year-over-year unless noted otherwise.  Before we begin, I want to bring your attention to pages A25 and A26 of our earnings deck, where we have provided you with P&L metrics for fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 consistent with the new reporting format we will begin using with the first quarter of fiscal 2018. As we announced last week, we're making these changes to enhance transparency and better align with industry reporting.  Now let me turn the call over to Jim. James Hackett : Thank you, Lynn and good afternoon, everyone. I was looking forward to this call today not only to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, but also to have a dialogue about our company and how we're managing both the near-term business while simultaneously building out a compelling vision for our vision.  I'll start with some brief reflections on CES in Las Vegas and NAIAS in Detroit last week a and how they support our direction. In fact, I had a chance to catch up with some of you last week at the show in Detroit. I was really proud of how Ford brought to life our passion for great vehicles from the New Ranger, The Edge and The Bullet Mustang to the expansion of new unique EV strategy.  Our ability to tap into the passion the people have for our vehicles is an advantage for us versus the tech world that might toy with cars and is connected to our vision for the future in a really profound way. At And both CES and the Detroit Auto Show, I found myself constantly sighting the world of human centered inside and to help to find the trajectory of our strategy. The importance of this is clear when you consider two major trends.  First, cities which of course house people are becoming ever more congested. And the vehicles which more people in city infrastructures will become smarter than we could ever, ever imagine. Our opportunity to leverage the capability of the smart vehicles in smart environment to attack that congestion problem. This new transportation operating system can add tremendous value to shareholders and we can help people have a better more productive day.  We also have the opportunity to improve logistics. Currently there is an inefficient operating system for good delivery as neither the vehicles nor the infrastructure is really smart enough. The growth of internet sales is compounding the problem I cited above of congestion. And that customers really prefer the convenience of buying over the web. Our early work with Domino's Pizza confirmed that people enjoyed getting deliveries from a robotic vehicle versus a human. It's apparent to us and the potential here is dramatic as we imagine a world where smart vehicles in a smart world not only improve traffic flow and reduce congestion but also improve logistics.  Now let me turn your attention to slide 3. I want to be direct and assure you that as we map out this exciting winning future during times of what we see as profound change we and I are intensely focused on fixing the health of the core business today. I know this is foundational to our success. In last week, we provided guidance for 2018. Clearly, I and my team are not satisfied with this level of performance and we see 2018 with the opportunity to prove to you that we can sharpen operational execution, dramatically improve the fitness we're talking about and continue making the big decisions strategically on where to play, how to win and of course properly allocate capital.  So, take your attention to slide 4. We continue to aggressively address the fitness of our business. This is both by resetting revenue and the taping costs in the short-term. But also redesigning our business to compete win in the future. We now can commit that we have multiple work streams up and running and we see significant potential benefits downstream which will dimension for you in the future.  We think of operational fitness as much broader build in just cost cutting. It will certainly drive meaningful cost out of business, no question. It\u2019s really important, because it\u2019s ultimately the state of our ability to compete. Ford is a strong company, I\u2019m proud of it. But we simply have not done and enough to truly be fit today. We have the opportunity now to make step change improvements across our business in areas like product development, manufacturing and marketing. To become more common in our platforms more efficient and more customer centric in our design thinking. We\u2019re moving quickly in transformer business though much of this work will really begin paying off as you ask in 2019 and beyond. Okay. If you turn to slide 5, I\u2019ll hit some of the highlights for the fourth quarter. Significantly, we developed and announced the plan that ensures all of new vehicles in the US are connected by 2019 and that goes to 90% globally by 2020. At the same time, we continue to advance on autonomous vehicle plan building our robust business model and making rapid progress in the technology or the capability of the vehicle.  In the quarter, we were proud to announce that we will expand our investment and our workforce at our plant here in Flat Rock, Michigan, which will be our initial manufacturing hub EVs. And as we discussed last week at the auto show, we have dramatically expanded accelerated our EV, Electrical Vehicle plans with $11 billion investment. On the product side, we are posed to build on our success. Ford was the bestselling brand in the U.S. could be 8 straight year and our F-Series franchise marked its 41st year as America's bestselling pick-up and margin between first and second continued to expand. The good news is that our investment in new product in recent years were really start to come fruition in 2018. We have 23 global vehicle launches plan for this year more than twice as many as 2017. So overall, I\u2019m positive with the progress, we\u2019re making toward our vision of becoming the most trusted mobility company. Designing the smart vehicles for a smart world and clearly, we\u2019re going to accelerate this work in 2018. Now, I\u2019ll turn to Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer for more detail on the quarter. Bob? Robert Shanks : Thanks, Jim and good afternoon everyone. I don\u2019t plan to go through any slides today. Instead, I just plan to make a few remarks to share our perspective on a quarter and the full year. Reconfirm the guidance for 2018 that we provided last week and then we\u2019ll take your questions.  Let me start by stating that 2017 overall was challenging including the fourth quarter. It\u2019s also however was a year of progress and I\u2019ll touch on that a bit more later. In the quarter, the topline improved with both wholesale volume and automotive revenue higher than a year earlier. The volume improvement was across all regions except Middle East and Africa. On 7% gain that we saw and revenue was due mainly to the higher volume. Company adjusted pre-tax profit was $1.7 billion, down $395 million from a year ago with a decline more than explained by the automotive segment. The lower automotive profit was due mainly to higher commodity cost and adverse exchange. But we also saw higher warranty costs mainly recalls in North America and Europe.  Our automotive operating margin was 3.7% that was down 200 basis points due to declines in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. Within automotive, the largest profit contributor once again was North America, where we earned $1.6 billion which was down $315 million. Operating margin was a 6.8% down 170 basis points. The year-over-year declines were due to effects from the Expedition Navigator launch and that was mainly lower volume and higher commodity and warranty cost. Outside North America in the automotive segment, results were a combined loss of $206 million with a profit in Europe about breakeven results in the Asia Pacific and losses in South America and EMEA. The combined loss of these operations was nearly $300 million greater than last year due to weak results in Asia Pacific and that was driven mainly by China as well as Brexit related effects and higher commodity and warranty cost in Europe.  Ford's Credit on the other hand turned in another strong quarter earning $610 million up 53%. Every cause or factor with the exception of credit losses contributed to the better performance. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.39 up $0.09. And that was driven by favorable tax filing which resulted in an adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter of 10%. Net income came in at $2.4 billion, that was $3.2 billion higher than a year ago due to significant remeasurement loss on pension and OPEB plans along with favorable tax planning.  Automotive operating cash flow was $2.3 billion up $800 million from a year ago and that was the strongest quarterly cash flow of the year. Ford's balance sheet remains strong with cash and marketable securities totaling $26.5 billion, and liquidity at more than $37 billion.  Let's turn now to the full year of 2017. Our automotive revenue grew 3% and that was driven by favorable mix, higher volume, with a consolidated operations and higher net pricing. Wholesale volume on the other hand including unconsolidated operations was about flat with lower volume in North America, EMEA and the Asia Pacific about offset by gains in South America and Europe. Adjusted company pretax profit totaled $8.4 billion, down $1.9 billion from 2016. This was driven by $1.2 billion of higher commodity costs, and about $850 million of adverse exchange, about $600 million of which was Brexit related as had been expected.  The company's internal profit decline in the full year was within our automotive segment. Automotive operating margin was 5%, down 170 basis points due to North America and Europe. These two regions alone accounted for nearly 90% of the commodity cost and 80% of the exchange impacts we saw on a year-over-year basis.  Adjusted EPS was $1.78 per share in the lower half of our most recent guidance and up $0.02 from a year ago. This reflects a 15.3% adjusted effective tax rate. Net income came in at $7.6 billion, up $3 billion from 2016, due to the significant lower remeasurement loss on pension and OPEB plans and favorable tax planning actions. Full year automotive operating cash flow came in at $3.9 billion down from $6.4 billion a year ago due to the lower automotive profit but also less favorable working capital changes.  As we enter [ph] 2018, we expect external conditions to be mixed, with industry volume globally expanding to some extent in most markets exception of course would be the U.S. where we expect volumes to be lower, but still strong commodities and exchange continue to be headwinds.  For 2018, we expect company revenue to be up to flat. This will be supported by 23 global product launches compared to 11 in 2017 as Jim just referenced. We see company adjusted EPS volume within a range of $1.45 to $1.70 assuming an adjusted effective tax rate of about 15%, which is similar to 2017.  As using our new 2018 reporting elements that Lynn just touched on the top end of the range assumes an automotive segment that is about unchanged from 2017 despite continued headwinds from commodities and exchange. The drivers therefore of our outlook for a decline in adjusted EPS are lower profit at for credit and an increase loss at mobility. The Ford credit change is due to a lower financing margin as interest rates rise along with a valuation change for derivatives.  For lower results at our mobility segment is driven our higher investments for autonomous vehicle program along with increased investments at Ford's Smart Mobility as we build capabilities and create future services opportunities. At the low-end of our adjusted EPS range reflects the normal volatility, we could see from recalls and further pressure from exchange and commodity prices. But it also recognizes potential challenges and fully delivering the recovery actions, we\u2019ve developed and deployed to offset the adverse year-over-year impact of commodities and exchange. Now, I\u2019d like to call out for your attention two slides. An EBIT margin bridge from 2017 to 2018 on slide 35. And on slide 32 a long-term view of commodity market price changes since the great recession and the impact that they had on our bottom-line. As the commodity slide indicates, we\u2019ve always been transparent with investors on the drivers of our profitability including commodities. No matter if there are tailwinds or headwinds. And we\u2019re doing a same now with the guidance, we\u2019re providing for 2018. We are confident in the processes our team use and managing our commodity exposures and their impact on the business globally. And we have applied them consistently during inevitable highs and lows of the commodity cycle. As of the end of January, a little more than one-third of our commodity exposures for the full year already will be lock-in to fixed contracts, hedges or purchases made.  I mentioned at the start, that 2017 was a challenging year yet we did make important progress to. The new organization and management team are operating very effectively. We established our vision our north star smart vehicles in a smart world that sets out of the path that were following. And we made important strategic and capital reallocation decisions. And Jim Hackett initiated and championed our global fitness reset and redesign initiatives, which are yield as he said significant opportunities that will improve the business going forward. So, we\u2019re looking forward to 2018. This is an important year and our journey to redefine and reshape Ford to our fitness initiatives and the strategic decisions we continue to make to become the world\u2019s most trusted mobility company. With that, turn it back to the operator, who will get us target our Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi good evening, thanks for taking my questions. I think firstly just relative to the software year-over-year results in Asia Pacific. Can you talk to more about the drivers there by causal factor, particularly net pricing? I see that incentives were $210 million headwind versus $133 million last quarter. How would you rate the competitive environment in China and the relative competitiveness of your line up there? And then with the six new product launches in China, you've referenced on slide 33. Should investors think about the net pricing for you may be starting to improve in that market this year? James Hackett : Just, so I'm going to let Jim Farley to handle this one. Jim Farley : Hi thank you for your question. It was a challenging year in China for us we were down in unit volume. We were down in unit volume 6%, but as you mentioned the real change in the market was incentives that affected our financials. Our average age of our product in China is about 4.3 years so we're at the very end of our cycle especially in the utility segment, where we're seeing a lot of new domestic players. We did orient our marketing in the second half of the year towards [cooping an edge] [ph] which we're responding. But the key is that in 2018 in the second half, we start a new wave of product launches in China. And we believe that freshness is going to be really important part of our growth story in China again. So, we did see a negative pricing last year especially in the fourth quarter. I think December was about 5%. So, the overall year was like 4% negative. But it was most acute in the utility segment especially for the older vehicles, which is where we are with our cycle plan. But very excited about our new launches in the second half of next year. Ryan Brinkman : Okay that's encouraging thanks. And then just lastly if I may, you've provided a lot of new and helpful data on the impact of commodities. I'd be curious though, what your latest thoughts are with regard to commodity and currency hedging. So, you mentioned that your commodity exposure is about one third fixed for 2018. Do you think that the right proportion to try to fix going forward about one third? Or can you discuss is there any particular commodity too that might be providing a particular pain point in 2018 like aluminum for instance. And what coping mechanisms if any might be available to you? Robert Shanks : I think as I mentioned in my comments, based on discussions that we've -- well actually I think mentioned that earlier so at the [indiscernible] excuse me what I said.  So, what I was saying is that to the media earlier this afternoon is that we understand I think in good sense what competitors generally do. Because we talked to suppliers and we understand what OEMs as a matter of force do. And the feedback we get is that they apply the same tools that we do, fix contracts where it's appropriate for example, steel there is no forward market. You really can't hedge and so forth. So, we kind of tether in through fixed contractors that are staggered through the course of the year are shield contracts. So, you get some smoothening if you will in terms of the ups and downs of market prices. We hedge a number of currencies and we hedge out certain periods of time. But one thing I would note though is that I believe this is going to be true for everyone, is that these are non-designated hedges. And so, for those of you that don't know what that means that are listening in. it means that you can lock in an economic value at the end of the contract. But because they're not designated you actually have to mark to market in every quarter. So, you don't escape the volatility of whatever is happening in terms of market prices. So, it doesn't help you from that regard. So, we do that. And then lastly, we do have spot boys for some of the commodities which again I think is an industry practice for those particular commodities. What\u2019s interesting, when you look at the special slide that we have included in slide 32, is we have said on Ford's business has been completely correlated to what\u2019s happened to the commodity prices, and I would argue that\u2019s going to be true for everyone because you may be able to delayed volatility through what\u2019s you are doing in terms of your own contract plan or hedge or so forth but totally again the data just snooze out it doesn\u2019t allow you to escape the overall trend of prices and as you can see on the slide that we provided, we have had some good years, we had some bad years, and interestingly, when you assume the results in the great recession through 2014 that team affected about $3.4 billion. You see slide there was a smaller downward commodity cycle at that point in time which we benefited from for two years, about 900 million each year and what we have seen in 2017 and 2018 as the global economy is growing pretty much synchronous, in a synchronus way around the world commodity prices are increasing and now we are about at the point in 2017, 2018 where we were in 2014 on a cumulative basis, and if you look at the trend of the prices, that\u2019s about whether they have come back to.  In terms of the effects as the slide indicates, two-thirds of the effect is largely around steel and aluminum and for those of you that are interested in the aluminum story because the strategy that we are pursuing on our larger pickups and on the SUVs, that\u2019s less than 25% of our impact. It's really steel that\u2019s the story and other metals, and aluminum is well, but it maybe not as much as all you had expected. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from Guggenheim. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi, good evening everybody. First, I wanted to ask you about the investments in electrification, so I think the slides from the Detroit Auto Show, was showing that was going from 4.5 billion plan through 2020 now it's going to be 6.7 billion. But at the same time, it was not mentioned in the 2018 factor, so first which buckets will they be reported in, is that mobility, is that in their regional automotive and then second can you talk about what the cadence will be for the next few years in terms of the investments and if that\u2019s a major factor in the earnings progression? Robert Shanks : So, when you look at the cadence, I think the cadence is just going to be an ever-increasing rise I think in the investments, because it's going to be driven by the PE factory, that would certainly had accelerated made some choices around pointing ahead some of the AV, so these will be sort of the progressive increase over the course of time. And it will show up in automotive and it will show up in the regions in which those vehicles are sold, AVs are moving to mobility but everything related to EVs are staying within automotive. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then specifically on the mobility investment, the press sort of moved that similar type of question. Any way you could sort of like dimension the progression here, I mean you obviously said that 2018 would be larger. Any sense of size and then going forward that also keep going up like the electrification or do you see that sort of leveling off and being a positive factor beyond this year? Robert Shanks : Yeah, the thing that\u2019s we have seen about that is of course you will have an increase in the AV investment as we move through the program to launch product in sort of the 2021 period and that will show up there. We'll also have investments associated with what Jim talked about at Deutsche Bank around the infrastructure that supported the business operations, the terminals, that sort of thing. And so, I would see that increasing, there will be revenue obviously on that until we get to the point where the product and the services associated with that hit the market.  On the other hand, while we're also making increased investments on the other part of Marcy's work for Smart Mobility which is think about as services, digital services. They are what you will start to see as we move through our business planning period as ever-increasing levels of revenue. And so, we actually can see the day even within business planning period where that part of our business is generating a profit and in fact quite a nice return. So, I think if you look at the two parts of the world a bit differently. But that part actually will start to contribute to bottom line I think over the five-year time period. James Hackett : And right now, these aren't totally matched as you would imagine. The technology capability development for the AV is way ahead of certainly in '18 and kind of revenue projections and the services similarly Marcy's work is building out the capability. It's within the realm of what we've been believing would happen. I don't think there is big surprises here. And we felt that it was time to be transparent about it, because the core investments really will matter as you look across competitors, about people who are claiming that really be in this business and those like us that are inventing it. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. And I guess in the name of transparency your character dimensions, the size of these increased investment in 2018? Robert Shanks : Well, when we get to the first quarter, give me a quarter to think about that. But what you will see when you look at the bridge chart that as you collectively look at slide 35 as you collectively look at everything related to automotive, that's a pretty flat result. So, what you can see is mobility is the largest single reporting element in terms of impact on a year-over-year basis. And that's on those two investments. And I would just say it's I'd say it's roughly split between autonomy and growth and capabilities and services expenses we create those opportunities. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Thanks everyone. I've got a couple of questions about the fixed global fitness redesign initiatives. First of all, Jim, what are the fixed initiatives? Can you tell us tonight please? James Hackett : Well we have a slide on 4 that I think as far as I want to go right now Adam and I'll explain the background. The slide on 4 is insight for you where I feel like the company overtime and this happens I think generally loses some of this fitness. So, I can take an example of a couple of them for you. We've talked about product complexity back in October, we started talking about that. We found the product where it had something like 30% of the sales and the 95% of the part count. And so, we what's taking the time and I know that I don't have forever with this, is we're going through and doing all the fact-based work to find out where the biggest opportunities are. And that's an example in complexity. We've been working as we've talked to you about product development. This is something that is an advantage for Ford that I think we haven\u2019t fully realized, which is having this capability all around the world with real time technologies, how do we actually get the advantage of the clock and shared efficiencies, because we can average cost down given the capability we have around the world. We\u2019ve been talking about marketing inside the company. The hope here is, if you stare at our advertising in the way that we buy media and things like that it doesn\u2019t look like some of the companies that you follow in other industries that are using machine learning. I\u2019ll stop there, because this night is not about those 6 projects. But I do want to tell you that the more time I have gotten with it, which is really October to now the more hopeful and clear its becoming to me about where we can find the kind of savings. And so, I\u2019ve ask the team to work with me on to mentioning that for our investors. And because we needed not only for you to understand the power of it but I want to use it to prioritize for a second and third.  Some of these are multi-year efforts, for example the enterprise systems that underpin, the different databases that we have in the company. There are things that I\u2019ve done before in this area that really beneficial to speed the market with delivery and efficiencies around the world. So, let me start there say that\u2019s\u2026 Adam Jonas : I mean, so Jim, if I respect you don\u2019t want to use tonight to talk about these initiatives. But I think a lot of the investment community on this call, this evening. This is the time, right. I know you haven't quite been a year obviously, you are still learning the organization. I think it would be -- it\u2019s a fair question asked when or we\u2019re going to know these 6. Because I ask your pretty straight 4 questions, you\u2019re alluding to the 6 in your slide, you\u2019re clearly not going to talk about them. That\u2019s a problem Jim, when we going to be very clear and transparent about this so that we can -- investors and your associates at Ford can rally around the mission. James Hackett : Yes. You don\u2019t have to wait long, you just have to stand in line. So, you have to wait till our people know. And I don\u2019t want to communicate to our people through the shareholder call. So, the way that we have that laid out is means that it comes pretty quickly, once we get the whole organization up to speed. Adam Jonas : Okay. Then I won\u2019t be specific and I will finish with a question is restructuring, perhaps restructuring that you have not announced to this point on the tables one of the many weapon, not your only weapon, but one of the initiatives at your disposal to execute on the 6 initiatives or some of them as you learn and are able to strategize upon them? Thank you. James Hackett : Yes. And I think that\u2019s a question we answered two quarters ago. We said that the impact of the redesign of things means that we\u2019re going to have excess capacity in areas that we don\u2019t need. I\u2019m not going to tell you which parts of the company that is. But of course, we will address that when the time is right.  But I also want to emphasize something here, which is in the design of fitness one of the things you have to do in addition to having you understand where we\u2019re going and our people understanding that is that you can't disrupt the flow of the business. I can tell you legendary stories where certain enterprise systems were put in prematurely in the business was disrupted. So, what you will you be witnessing now in the way that we started this work. As we long identified, where we want to work. We\u2019re now in the redesign phase we are now dimensioning the value we have assigned responsibilities, I am meeting with teams weekly, I just had a big meeting Friday, with people in the company and its getting close to the point, where I think we can start to bring you under the tent, but it's not tonight. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Rod Lache, from Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache : Hi, everybody. My question is just kind of along the same line. So, I appreciate the long-term strategic objectives and initiatives, you are talking about, but the pretty high level and then I was hoping maybe you could at least give us a little bit of financial grounding towards that 8% long-term auto margin target, it's about 250 basis points higher than you are doing now, which would be 3.5 billion of improvement.  So, my question is, is there at this point a specific bridge to get there and can you give us some idea of what the high-level buckets would be maybe not specifically on restructuring but when you are thinking about how much of this is net cost reduction. you talked about some gross horse buckets, how much of it is mix repositioning for your portfolio? Robert Shanks : Yeah, let me take first shot at that and then if anyone else wants to chime in, they can. So, as I mentioned, I think and answer at your conference Rod, in our present business plan we actually see the business achieving the 8% margins towards the end of the business time period and it improves over the period. So, we actually and that\u2019s all physically based. That is without $1 of the global business redesign efforts that Jim was just talking about. And why we haven\u2019t provided specifics as Jim mentioned in his response to Adam and the question before, what we did say both Jim and I at the conference is that the early work on monetizing the opportunities that has just been developed thus far is more to come, it's really material in terms of impact on OpEx but also on CapEx. And we think it will be more as I said, so that would be incremental to what I just described. Now if you want to say that it's not unusual for business plan to be, looks like a hockey stick, I take a lot of comfort, we try these very realistic and 50-50 in our calls, but we know you can always anticipate the inevitable surprises that happen in this business, both externally but maybe internally. So, when I look at the opportunities of the find that\u2019s already been these preliminary by the team it gives me more confidence in our ability to at least hit the levels that we are targeting if not do better.  I would say that, a lot of that is around product, I think we have also talked -- you saw the big increase in product launches this year versus last year, I think Jim mentioned at Deutsche Bank, there is even more to come, when you look at 2019, 2020. So, I think that is going to help drive the top line. We do think there will be opportunities in terms of mix as we continue to work on that and revenue and then the good news on the cost side as well, we would expect costs to come up to some extent, come up some extent over that period. We are getting the appropriate amount of operating leverage from the top line and the amount of the increases isn\u2019t as great as what we have seen over the last eight years. So, I think we are starting to get the balance right, the balance better with the fitness [ph] to be an opportunity on top of that. Rod Lache : Okay. And I guess just two other questions. When Jim Hackett said that we are going to start seeing this payoff in 2019 some of these initiatives. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what that means? And also, just the point of clarification on Asia. Jim Farley mentioned that you've got a lot of product coming on the back half of '18. So, should we be thinking that the results are pretty much what we see right now to the first half when you start to get some traction financially in the back half or is that more of a 2019 benefit? Robert Shanks : So, let me answer that one first. We would expect, and then I say away from providing much as I can business unit guidance, and certainly conversations, but building on the comments that he made, we do expect the second half of this year to be a better half than the first half for Asia Pacific driven by those launches. So, they're not launches that are all I guess very end of the year. We actually will see effect in the second half of the year as well.  And then what was your other part of the question? I forgot. Rod Lache : Jim Hackett was mentioning that we're going to start to see some benefits from your initiatives starting in 2019. James Hackett : As Bob's spooling up to talk about what he has recorded, I want to reaffirm something. We've identified the fixed workstreams are up and running. And the benefits, we're talking about '18 and '19 some of them, the bulk of what I'm feeling from what I've seen comes a little later, because some of these are substantial redesigns. And I think that what we really need, what you're asking for the dimension of what the value of that is. And so that's just -- we're not ready to release that tonight. And it's not because we don\u2019t know it or we're not working on it. It's as I said I want to have a plan to include the people in the company. So, I'm sitting here thinking identifying the 6 workstream for you might build more cred, that you're on the right things. But I think you've got a trust we got that part right. I think you really want to understand what the yield is going to be and that's a really fair question and when we plan on answering. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino : Wonderful thank you. Jim, I just want to follow up on couple of your earlier comments about your mobility partnerships. And you mentioned what you saw from the customers from the partnership with Domino's. but I'm more interested in what your partners have seen from that business. Is there been an increase and the products being ordered as a result. Is there any potential to see these developments convert into commercial opportunities and to deploy and for not just to be a test or demonstration? Ultimately my question is what's the feedback from your partners on the impacts to their business both from a cost and an incremental revenue generation standpoint? James Hackett : I'm going to ask Jim Farley to add to this. But if you actually [Doyle] at Domino's just announced that he'll be stepping down in June. And so, this interview is online about their experience with Ford. He highlights it is one of the really big things he's excited about. So, I'm going to let you read between his lines on how he talking about their business. But they reupped as we expand soon in some other markets are testing Domino's has asked continue. So, Jim. Jim Farley : What they learned are couple of things. First of all, for those who spend a lot of the cost is local delivery. This is a really important leverage to lower the cost. Because the driver costs are meaningful. But equally interesting like companies like Postmates and others that we haven't announced yet. They are excited about the revenue expansion. So, let\u2019s take like a local home improvement company. You can imagine that it\u2019s a big revenue opportunity for them to have a fleet of automated vehicles to deliver work materials to the worksite.  That\u2019s one thing. The second area that maybe is surprised to us is the data they\u2019re getting back. Suspension for the companies that are looking to grow their company. They are very interested and the data that comes back from the delivery. Where it is, exactly what was digitizing all that, so they can really forecast that revenue growth. Good example will be local home improvement. They know what this would if someone is framing out a house, maybe next will be installation. So, they kind of know what the business opportunity is based on the data, where it\u2019s going in and what it is. I hope that makes sense. David Tamberrino : I think you might have lost me a little bit within there. Maybe just as a follow-up to help clarify. I think what I heard was you are seeing some increased orders and increased demonstrations from your commercial partners here. At what point, do you think that could be or become into something more meaningful revenue generation from those partnerships? James Hackett : Yes. I think we are answering the question, did Domino\u2019s sell more pizzas. And that\u2019s why I want to draw your attention to them. Now you are asking or realizing more vehicle business. Is that what you\u2019re asking? David Tamberrino : Yes. I am trying to understand if that partnership specifically is going to move towards more units being delivered or a significant commercial deployment for customers of yours from your feedback. James Hackett : Yes. Right now, we\u2019re still testing with them. So, I\u2019m going to just give pointing back to their comments, they are very positive. David Tamberrino : Understood. And just my second question for you tonight the launch issues with the expedition in the navigator. Have those been controlled or is there still going to be some issues heading the 1 to 18 P&L? James Hackett : So, Joe Hinrichs is here. And I\u2019m ask Joe to speak to the launches. Joe Hinrichs : Here the expedition, navigator launch is going extremely well. In the fourth quarter, we got off to a little slower start than we anticipated due to some availability of some products on our suppliers. But the products been incredible received and feedback on the quality has been great and we\u2019re building to plan right now and we plan to do that all year. David Tamberrino : Okay. So, the issues have been fixed, what I heard? Joe Hinrichs : Correct. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes. Couple of questions. First, when you came in Jim, you, I understand inherited the performance compensation, executive performance compensation plan that was in the March proxy. Consistent with what you\u2019ve been saying about 2018 sounds like a transition year kind of stronger performance through 2022. How you\u2019re thinking about the mix of short-term and long-term? How you\u2019re going to be thinking about compensation recognizing of course it\u2019s a board decision going forward? James Hackett : I think what you\u2019re asking is have we changed that we announced any compensation changes. So, is that what you ask to me? Brian Johnson : Well or are you considering shifting for example the focus between short term and long-term it was 60-40 in last year's plan as part of the go forward plan? James Hackett : I would tell you that I have had discussions with the compensation committee about the short term and long-term plans here at Ford and got their support that the vision that we are painting for fitness and quality improvements, the smart vehicles, smart world can be really supported by the leverage that we have with our share program and our long-term program. We have a performance share program that\u2019s tied to shareholder return and a time invested stock that\u2019s smaller portion of that, that\u2019s what\u2019s your reading in the proxy I guess. Brian Johnson : Well that was [indiscernible]. James Hackett : Yes, so and look forward to news on this year, as we publish that. Brian Johnson : Okay, because it sounded like you wanted to help it more towards longer term performance, is that fair? James Hackett : Its already ahead of the market in that regards. So, I mean this is the kind of stuff that\u2019s I think I just want to confirm with you that everybody I think is in the right place with alignment of the compensation and the plans we have. Brian Johnson : Okay. second question, you talked in the 2018 guide, about mix improvements. Yet we certainly have at the auto show two competitors unveiling new pickup truck products, biggest in high segment that enjoyed strong ATP increases. So, are you thinking mix and price could improve in pickups despite that fresh competition, or you really talking about the other 20 some product launches around the world? James Hackett : So great question. We are very fortunate because we are going in the year with essentially new F series as well as a very fresh separate duty and then we saw even in December our price, transaction prices stiffen in December. As Joe mentioned, we have the navigator expeditions, so part of the opportunity for us is definitely going to be those other launches. The first six months of the year when everyone is selling down their old model, we expect a very competitive environment. But over the second half of the year with the new products obviously there is going to be more pricing in the markets for the goodness of those. So, I think we are going to see on the pickup truck market a very competitive environment especially for the next six months, but we have been in that for a couple of months now. And we have been growing our transaction price in that more competitive market, example the 2017 sell down. As we go into the first six months, we would expect that competitiveness to be there and our performance to be there, but we have the addition now as Joe said of good availability for Navigator and Expedition and of course we have other vehicles coming as you alluded to in North America, for example a new Mustang as we go into the spring market. So, I think we\u2019re really well positioned, it's been a combination of both. Operator : And our next question is coming from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : Hi, good evening guys. I just a first question for you Jim. I mean as you going through the review of the company, you are looking at fitness as well as where you want to shift the product portfolio as well as your smart vehicle efforts and really sort of your total review here. I am just curious if you are coming across anything or think there is any way that maybe if you accelerated sort of spending and committed larger chunk of capital that you may either be able to accelerate the fitness of the company or potentially develop AVs faster. And I guess that will be sort of maybe sort of internal spending that might make a lot more sense or maybe even some acquisitions outside for technology. James Hackett : Thank you, John. So, I heard really three different streams in that. Let's take the first one, stemming on AV. Right now, we're making a big commitment to that with the Argo AI investments and things that we're doing. And I do believe there is art and science at work here. So, I'm not sure more money is the answer there, we're looking at really a solid underpinning to the way we're writing the software for these vehicles so that as you have over the air updates and you have changes, we're not going to have a lot of problems in the future with updating kind of that capability. That's an example taking a long view in terms of getting that right. The other areas that you mentioned fitness, and that is a great, that's a really great question. Absolutely, if I saw a payback for fitness returns, Bob and I are really interested in short term pay less than two years kinds of things. We would be all over that. And so, nothing like that is being held up in any kind of bureaucracy. And what was the third area you mentioned? John Murphy : No, in just smart vehicles. So, it kind of falls in AI but just in the smart vehicle efforts for the smart world in this granular plan? James Hackett : And I think it you asked about acquisitions? John Murphy : Yes, would any of these acquisitions pile in to any of this? James Hackett : Yeah very, very open to that. Look for news as you will in that area, we're very interested in that. So, all three of those things I want you to feel like we're not capital constrained in the sense of moving faster. It's having the designs right. Having the right ideas, getting things situated to go. And I approved progress that we made which is hard to see from your perspective. As I walk into the job there was a lot of kind a backup of decisions that had been stuck for a while. And we've let some of that tension to help and gotten things moving. So, we're building an all new dedicated AV vehicle. And that platform is -- we now have that decided and working on that. So, I'm confident that if you are wondering if there is any hesitance on spending or time that's not the issue. John Murphy : And then just Bob, as we look forward to 2018, I was just curious if you could sort of outline your view on used vehicle pricing for particularly for the U.S. market what that means for Ford Motor Credit because that was a big unexpected benefit maybe at least from my perspective in the second half of 2017, sort of how you're thinking about that for 2018 and what that means for Ford Motor Credit but also sort of your view on new vehicle pricing? James Hackett : Yeah as you saw the Ford Credit's page in the deck, they benefited across broad parts of the business, but certainly that was a factor. For the full year they came in about I think on average to portfolio we saw a decline of about 3% which as you remember conversations that we had at the beginning of last year, I think is about half or so what we thought was going to happen. When we look at '18 in terms of the assumptions we've built in. we've assumed something around 4% on average. John Murphy : Okay. Then if I could just sneak in one housekeeping on the raws. Is there any way that you could share mortgage raw material risks and pressure maybe with other partners in the value chain, particularly we maybe some of the suppliers or is there no way to really kind of shift around sort of this exposure and things aren\u2019t going to change there? James Hackett : Well, I think the area that you would look at it the indexing I suppose. Because in terms of the indexing one of the things that we, I think learned a long time ago is that, there was a point where, we would negotiate and try to withhold giving them good news, when the prices were low and then fight with them when the reverse with true. And I think we found that we were spending a lot of time and not giving a lot of long-term benefit. By focusing on that as opposed to working with the suppliers on their best innovations, their best designs, material cost reductions and getting the best cost as job one. So, we have deployed the indexing across the board on certain commodities as I said one quarter, one month in some cases, I think was 12 months. And we just feel that\u2019s -- you\u2019re not going to avoid the long-term trend and enables our team to focus on what we think as that are long-term play for us in terms of getting true low cost excluding the commodities. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Bob, if I heard correctly the EV spend is included in automotive. So, if I look at slide 35 where you provided the bridge. I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s in the costs ex-commodities bucket. But you also have obviously a bunch of structural contribution costs with the Navigator/Expedition ramp, the EcoSport launch and just broadly more content increasing from connectivity and active safety. So, can you provide any sort of breakdown between electrification and sort of the more traditional structural contribution costs in that headwind for \u201918? James Hackett : Well, I\u2019m not going to breakout EV, if I understand the question. But let me answer the question this way. So, when I look at that far of margin change around costs, including commodities, about half of that is depreciation, amortization. So, if you think about that that\u2019s investment cost, across the whole business not just EV. Which to some extent is already behind us, because we spent some money and this was just the DNA of that. Some of which will be spent during the year and then the amortization begins.  So, about half of that and then the other two pieces that make up the rest of it is essentially relatively modest increase in engineering and that is largely on EVs as part of that, but it\u2019s also pretty much on trucks and SUVs as a reduction on car. And then the balance which as a smaller piece is around our launches, the increased number of product launches that we saw some of that will show up in higher launch costs. But the biggest piece like three quarters of it is around D&A and engineering with the D&A being the bigger portion. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then just a housekeeping on the FX side. I mean in the past, I think one of the biggest cost as you talk about was pound, euro, which I think is actually moving in your favor here. But I just want to understand with the sort of FX component of that 1.6 billion you\u2019re talking about? James Hackett : Yes. The FX component is, a little less than half of that, will still be Europe, but that will be well down from what it was this year. And some of that is continued impact of our revenue exposure on a net basis to the sterling and a cost exposure to the euro. So, it\u2019s actually more the cross rates between those two currencies than it is vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. dollar. But, it will be coming down, which is what we had expected. And then, the rest of it is largely in South America and somewhat in Asia Pacific, not much effect in North America at all. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Itay Michaeli : So, just a first question on mobility and autonomous. I think you, as you plan to roll out the self-driving vehicles on your partner networks and your customers in 2019 and 2020, two questions there. Can you share when you think you\u2019ll actually be able to run a true driverless, so actually removing the driver and getting the vehicles to that speed, as well as what the fleet size will look like Ford in 2019 and 2020? Jim Farley : It\u2019s Jim Farley. So, as we announced, we are going to our first city this quarter. So, the fleet we have in the market is going to be business model like people driving the vehicle. Our goal is now just implementing the first cycle of new prototypes. And we won\u2019t go in the specifics but 2018 is the year where you are going to see a lot of progress on our VDS and the vehicle being autonomous. But that\u2019s going to be development work for the next several years until we launch in 2021. And we are going to be using existing products because we are developing an all new product which obviously won\u2019t be ready until the prototypes -- Joe's team is building the prototypes, so for the next couple of years. The fleets over the next couple of years will expand but they are going to be different types of hybrid Fords and that will play out over the next 24 months. Our goal is to get people in the vehicles this year to see how our VDS works by itself. So, you\u2019ll have a feel for how far -- how fast we are going with the VDS itself done by Argo this year. So, I think 2018, you will have a good chance to assess that in person. And we have a very concrete plan to roll out the prototype fleet of those autonomous vehicles over the next two years in multiple cities. So, please know that fleet will grow in size. We\u2019re not going to be specific what it is, but it\u2019s a very meaningful investment money wise, to build out all those prototypes. And of course, we had different cycles of prototypes that have updated not only algorithms and computing software but also perception equipment. James Hackett : One thing I bring to mind, in Vegas, two weeks ago at CES, we had shared some blogs. There were people that were in vehicles in that test market, I think six or seven. And this lady wrote really telling article about how she got car sick and every one of them but not anyone of them completed a trip as advertised. And the reason I am doing this, I don\u2019t want to talk down the capability because it\u2019s very promising. But, I feel in the questions that you want to see for behind or ahead. And the way you are going to be able to judge that is the performance of the product. So, in this case, we are going to test. We are expanding I mentioned the Domino's test. We are -- our goal is actually building vehicles as well as Ford. And in doing that, you will have more to write about and understand the Ford performance. But, I also -- and holding the Company accountable for Ford performance here on the quality basis and people trusting us in this product. And that is the new world of the AV is that one test is getting there and then the other test is really of high quality. And I'm asking to think about both of those goals. Itay Michaeli : That's very, very helpful. Thanks so much. A quick, quick follow-up, just switching back to the financials on slide 35. I think, you alluded to a prior question, I\u2019ll make sure I have it correct in my notes. But for full-size pickup performance and how that relates to the positive market factors. Can you share a bit of just kind of what you're looking at for Ford's full-size pickup North America, the F-150 platform in terms of your revenue and variable profits for 2018 plus 2017? And how that relates to the overall positive market factors? Robert Shanks : No, Itay, we\u2019re not going to provide that information. Itay Michaeli : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question is from the line of David Whiston from Morningstar. David Whiston : Thanks. I heard a lot of talk from the team lately on fitness. And some examples such as too many vehicle combinations. And two-part question is I guess where is this weakness, regionally speaking, where is it? Is it pretty much all over the globe or is it really skewed to one or two regions? And also, why wasn\u2019t this rectified more during Alan and Mark\u2019s time? James Hackett : Well, I\u2019ll just take the second thing. You got to look at I\u2019m here, because it wasn't, and that's as much as I want to comment on two really fine people I have a lot of respect for. But, I'd rather make the issue the Company's fitness than those two folks. And this problem that you're telling about, I mean, I just picked one for Adam, so he could be satisfied that we weren't just doing head fakes here that we really are working on the right things. That problem is all over the world. And underpinning was a nice try to try and get the more efficient model by building platforms around the world. We've learned a lot in doing that and we're going to be lot better as we adjust in that single category of complexity. We're not the only OEM that\u2019s dealing with that problem, as I read. Now, the question is, can we be more clever in the way we address it and I think we can. Unidentified Company Representative : So, David, the only thing I would add is when I look at the business, North America has been operating at a very high level of margin for a long time, it\u2019s starting to come off the level it had been at. So, I think you\u2019re starting to see the impact of fitness because as it is affected by increasing regulatory costs, the commodity costs and so forth. I mean, we're not able to get the same level of margins that others may be able to do. So, I think that shows the gap, if you will, that we have to address in North America. Obviously, in the markets outside North America. If you go back and look at history, I mean we've done reasonably poor, I would say across the collection of those markets ever since the downturn. So, to me, the issue there clearly is the fitness issue, but it's probably as much as if not more than strategic issue in terms of how we\u2019ve approached the markets, the business models we brought to bear, our expertise and confidence in some of those markets, the products themselves one Ford versus something that\u2019s more regional, all sorts of things in that space. And that's something that we are actively addressing through the strategic work stream that we have underway. James Hackett : David, it\u2019s Jim again. These are moments for me to give your insight as well that this team, there is -- I went from -- Mark had 19 direct reports, I have 8. And you have three of the key leaders sitting here at the table with me that own all parts of this business. Joe Hinrichs and Jim Farley, there\u2019s really just two people that have to deal now with that product complexity around the world. That wasn\u2019t the case in the previous organization. So, that\u2019s an insight for you about why should you have more confidence in our ability to address something like that as I\u2019m inferring. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of James Albertine from Consumer Edge Research. Derek Glynn : This is Derek Glynn on for Jamie. Thanks for taking my question. So, you discussed partnerships you have in place with Domino\u2019s and Postmates. Can you just provide an update from a regulatory standpoint as you pursue all these new initiatives and collaborations? What\u2019s the dialogue been like with regulators? Do you see any near or medium-term hurdles in this regard? James Hackett : I think -- let me just clarify, Jamie. You\u2019re talking about the regulators oversight of AVs? Derek Glynn : Yes, exactly. Joe Hinrichs : Hi. It\u2019s Joe Hinrichs again. I mean, you\u2019re hearing this play out and a lot of the government debates and discussions are taking place. With our government affairs team, we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019re going to get the support necessary to move this technology Ford on the AV front. I mean, when you think about it, everyone you talk to, realizes long-term benefits that Jim Hackett\u2019s been describing as a potential for our Company and for others in the mobility space. So, we don\u2019t see any obstacle at this point. Jim Farley talked earlier about, we\u2019re going to make a lot of progress this year in the testing -- in the market. So, we\u2019re not being held back from that. Obviously, we\u2019re expecting over time to be able to advance the number of vehicles and locations. But that\u2019s not holding us back right now, and we\u2019re optimistic that the governments understand the opportunity here and are moving forward. Operator : And at this time, I\u2019m showing we have no further questions. I now turn it back to Mr. Jim Hackett. James Hackett : Thank you. So, let\u2019s close out the call today with some emphasis on key points that come through. 2017, I came here in June 1st, and in that six months, we worked extremely hard on resetting revenue and cost expectations for that year. And a lot of the underlying work that resulted in the performance we had, should not be unappreciated. The team did a really good job, really proud. Meanwhile, we reorganized the business, we had told you about streamlining the leadership team. We\u2019ve written a new winning aspiration. We took important decisions. It was asked on this call to accelerating key areas. So, for example, in the connected vehicles, that\u2019s a big investment. The AV strategy, I want to emphasize that\u2019s on track and investments flowing there. And of course, you heard about the new EV plan, which Ford did not have a complete story about electrical vehicles, and we\u2019ve gone from being incidental about that, it was a key part of our future. You\u2019ve heard us talk about this fitness thing but it\u2019s really starting to take hold in the Company. I mentioned this already. So, I\u2019ll just emphasize the six work streams are up and running, they are staffed. The dimensioning is starting to come on and the dimensions are -- and values of that need to be shared with you and we plan to do that this year. Our approach to capital allocation is also evolving as well. We are working at markets -- looking at markets, excuse me, and the word play [ph] questions. We have already shared how we are shifting the vehicle portfolio around the world. I can attest to you that we have sped up decision-making. That\u2019s going to continue in 2018. There is no wasting there in terms of waiting for things to get done. And you are going to see us make important capital allocation decisions. We have Bob Shanks who put together a Board plan for the year, for us to review strategy with the Board each quarter. That\u2019s all something that wasn\u2019t there before; it\u2019s all been mapped out. We are also moving quickly to advance the smart mobility business and look forward to some announcements from Marcy\u2019s organization soon in that space, exciting things that will be developed. So, you can see that as I stare back from June 1st to now, I have this feeling that I am really happy with the things that we have laid, the pipe we have kind of laid, not happy at all that we are not proving to you what that\u2019s going to yield and really confident that you will be happy with us as we bring that forward. So, I want you to understand that I get how important that dimensioning is, I get how important this year is to prove this management team\u2019s ability at a convert. And I look forward to proving to you that our vision is really going to make Ford an exciting brand in the future. Thanks for your time today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Ford Motor Company fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 earnings conference call. We thank you greatly for your participation.

Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Operator : Good day. My name is Jason, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford Motor Company first quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Lynn Antipas Tyson - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, Jason. Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's first quarter 2018 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO, and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are : Marcy Klevorn, Executive Vice President and President of Mobility; Joe Hinrichs, Executive Vice President and President, Global Operations, Jim Farley, Executive Vice President and President, Global Markets : and Brian Schaaf, CFO of Ford Credit. Jim will begin with a brief review of the quarter, and then cover a review of our strategy and updated financial targets. Bob will then review the quarterly results in more detail. After Bob's section, we'll open the call up for questions. And following Q&A, Jim will have a few closing remarks. Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholderford.com. Today's discussions include some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance. Actual results may vary, and the most significant factors are included in our presentation. Also, all comparisons are year over year unless noted otherwise. Company EBIT and EPS are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is on a volume-weighted basis. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, Lynn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. Our goal today is to provide an update on fitness, share with you our strategic approach to creating value, and detail our updated performance targets. I said last October that the transformation of Ford had to start with getting the business fit. In fact, this preceded the ever-important strategic questions. We are improving our speed, decision-making, and execution. And today, we're ready to dimension this for you. I'm really proud of the work of our team and even more excited about the value we believe these actions will create for our stakeholders. Simply put, the items I want to detail for you are at the center of our value creation efforts. One, through our fitness and strategy work, we have gained clarity on where we need to focus. And this includes answering questions on what do we do with the businesses not earning their cost of capital and identifying which underlying processes need to be modernized. Two, we have also gained clarity on our vehicle portfolio and where we want to play. And in parallel, we'll leverage a suite of propulsion systems. Think of these as the internal combustion system, hybrids, and battery electric vehicles, to give customers what they want regardless of fuel prices. And three, I'm also pleased to share that our work to support our vision for smart vehicles in a smart world is starting to gel and showing the potential to create long-term value. I will share more today on this emergent work. Okay, next I would like to briefly review our first quarter results, so please turn to page 2. And looking at the quarter, we delivered a solid company EBIT and year-over-year improvement in company operating cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong with $38 billion in liquidity. We also made several important acquisitions. We purchased Autonomic, which is already leading development of our transportation mobility cloud. And we acquired TransLoc, a provider of transit system software for cities. Both acquisitions are critical to advancing our mobility strategy. In the quarter, we also strengthened our collaboration with Mahindra Group, and we're working to jointly develop new SUVs and electric vehicles for customers in India and emerging markets. And in this quarter, we've also been building momentum from a product perspective. We made investments in manufacturing to meet the surging demand in North America for our new Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition. These trucks are selling extremely well. We also introduced the EcoSport in the fast-growing sub-compact SUV segment. We reinforced our leadership in trucks and SUVs with the launch of the first-ever Ranger Raptor in Asia Pacific. This is a high-performance pickup unique to just Ford Motor Company. We established our first proving ground for our autonomous vehicle business. This is through a collaboration with Miami-Dade County in Florida and partners such as Domino's and Postmates. With them, we launched a series of pilot programs to build a business that moves goods efficiently and profitably in those congested urban areas. I'm proud to tell you that we're on track together with Argo AI to deliver a commercial-grade self-driving vehicle at scale in 2021 for the movement of people and the movement of goods. And finally, in the UK, we expanded our footprint in mobility and launched our Chariot commuter shuttle services in London. This marks Chariot's first expansion outside the U.S. We'll now please turn to page 3, and let's dive into the highlights of our fitness and its impact on our overall business. Over our plan period, which covers 2019 through 2022, we're telling you today that we've identified $11.5 billion of cumulative cost and efficiency opportunities. This is incremental to the $14 billion in reduced material and engineering costs we outlined last October. We've also identified opportunities to reduce the capital intensity of our business model by a cumulative $5 billion over that same timeframe in 2019 through 2022. By applying just the results of our fitness review over our plan period, we have some great news. We now expect our EBIT margin and our return on invested capital to bottom out this year in 2018. We also expect to meet our 8% EBIT target in 2020. This is a full two years earlier than our previous target of 2022. And we're going to achieve a return on invested capital in the high teens now by 2020. This reduction in capital intensity means that we now expect our annual CapEx spend to peak this year at $7.5 billion and then decline. By 2022, we expect to deliver balanced CapEx spend and depreciation and amortization. They'll be aligned with each other. These targets do assume continued healthy economic conditions. Now, if there is a down cycle, we believe a more fit Ford will drive a more resilient business model. Okay, turn to slide 4. Following the work of the past 11 months, we can now give you a more clear view of how we plan to improve our returns. We believe this reflects a profound refocus of our business. In this chart, we used our actual 2017 EBIT results to plot the parts of our business based on margins and return, so let me take your eyes to the green bubble in the northeast corner. This represents the areas of our business that deliver 8%-plus EBIT and 10%-plus ROIC. This part of our business alone generates $14 billion of profit, an operating margin of 16%, and a return on invested capital of 40%. This is a tremendous business, and we have a lot to work with in this category. Now, if you apply even modest valuation assumptions to this portion of our business, there's about a 50% upside to our current stock price. However, three parts of our business dilute our overall returns. The yellow bubble reflects marginally profitable areas that don't return the cost of capital. They're lower margin and they don't return the cost of capital. The low-performing areas that have neither the right margin or the returns are shown on the bottom left in the red. And investments we're making in the new products for future growth are depicted by the gray circle in the middle. They're just getting started. So here's the key point. We're going to feed the healthy part of our business and deal decisively with the areas that destroy value, where we can raise the returns of certain underperforming parts of our business via the fitness initiative you hear us talk about or an alternative business model, we will, and then we'll disposition the rest. Okay, turn to page 5, and I want to take a deeper look now at fitness. As I mentioned, we identified $11.5 billion of cost and efficiency opportunities that will drive improved EBIT margin, and we expect to capture about one-third of this by 2020. There are some good examples of where this will come from. In marketing and sales, we've identified three key areas. On the fixed marketing side, we can better improve our digital capabilities and improve our return on investment on media. In addition, via regionalization and personalization, we can better optimize our yield management in our incentives program. Within engineering, we're moving to five flexible architectures that underpin our vehicles, with a modular catalog strategy covering 70% of the value of the vehicle. These changes will reduce the time from sketch to production by 20% and deliver significant new cost savings. Also, it will contribute to complexity reduction in orderable configurations. This will deliver savings throughout the enterprise, from the supply base to manufacturing and to our dealers. In manufacturing, we're redesigning our freight network using big data, and we developed much more aggressive labor targets for our next-generation vehicles. If you will, turn to page 6. Our fitness work has also allowed us to reduce the capital intensity of our business by $5 billion over our plan horizon, 2019 to 2022. We had expected to invest $34 billion, and that's now dropped to $29 billion. For example, we've identified opportunities to drive capital reduction through reuse of equipment and tools in our plants as well as additional benefits from the move to the common modules that I mentioned earlier. To put this all together, I want to share with you the framework on page 7 that we're using to drive a more competitive, higher return, and resilient business. Our industry is undergoing a complete redesign of what we think of as the historic transportation system and the role of automakers and everyone else in that system. This redesign will reshape how our customers live, work, and move, how business is transacted, how cities are managed, how urban congestion and pollution are controlled. At Ford, we want to do more than compete in this new world. We intend to lead its design. Enabling human progress through freedom of movement has always been central to our mission, and it's the reason we have been successful for 115 years. We'll remain true to our heritage as we transform our business model to capitalize on the trends I just described : by making smart choices; by building smart vehicles that integrate the best technology; and by providing customers with the most trusted mobility platform and services in the industry. We are on an incredibly exciting journey to redefine the automotive industry. And as we said, it starts with making these smart choices. One of those is our first choice to have a winning portfolio. As I mentioned, we will focus on products and markets where we know we can win. Let me share a specific example. By 2020, almost 90% of our Ford portfolio in North America will be trucks, utilities, and commercial vehicles, including, of course, their electrified versions. Given declining customer demand and product profitability, we will not invest in next generations of traditional Ford sedans for North America. Over the next few years, our Ford car portfolio in North America will transition to two vehicles, our best-selling Mustang and an exciting all-new Focus Active crossover coming out next year. A second choice is a full commitment to new propulsion, including adding hybrid electrics to high-volume profitable vehicles like the F-150, the Mustang, the Explorer, and the new Bronco. Our battery electric vehicle rollout starts in 2020 with a performance utility, and we will have 16 battery electric vehicles by 2022. In our endeavor to make electric vehicles more desirable, we'll deliver vehicles with the capability, performance, and interior design that customers need and want, without the traditional fuel economy penalty they used to see. Our third choice is autonomous technology. We're going to develop a profitable autonomous vehicle service that offers the most trusted and human-centered ride-hailing and goods delivery experience. Our partners at Argo AI have assembled an incredible collection of talent and expertise. I can't really exaggerate that. This is a great group of people, and we're working hand in hand with them to build a great AV business model. Our final choice is the mobility experience. This is about creating and scaling our mobility platform and services that will drive a new what we're calling sticky revenue and profit streams for us. We see ourselves not just as a provider of mobile solutions, but also as an orchestrator of digital connections, from vehicle to street to business to home. That's going to be an exciting proposition. It's all enabled by fitness, as I said. We're starting here and talking about four components. The first is the improved operating leverage. The second is the adaptive business model, as evidenced by our Mahindra agreements. That's plural. There's more than one, be it build, partner, or buy to generate the highest returns. And the third is improved capital efficiency. The fourth is our bedrock, a strong balance sheet. We work hard to maintain that. So before I turn it over to Bob, I want to emphasize so there's no question. We're committed to taking the appropriate actions to drive profitable growth and maximize the returns of our business over the long term. We do have a bias towards urgent action. We aren't just exploring partnerships. We've now done them. We aren't just talking about ideas, but we've made decisions. We're going to host an analyst meeting in New York in September, where we'll walk you through more details on our strategy. September 26 is when we're scheduling that. In the coming months, though, you'll see more announcements about the specific actions we're taking to transform Ford. So let me turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Shanks. Bob? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I don't plan today to talk to specific slides. Instead, I'm going to share some details of our first quarter results and our perspective on them, talk to our company guidance for the full year, and provide additional texture on selected elements of the business that are consistent with our full-year outlook. As Jim mentioned, first quarter results were solid. They were in line with our expectations and consistent with our outlook for the full year. Company revenue at $42 billion was up 7%, driven by higher volume from consolidated operations, favorable exchange-related effects, and higher net pricing. Revenue was up across all parts of the business except Middle East and Africa, where it was flat, with Europe delivering the greatest increase. And this was due to exchange and higher pricing on new products and to recover Brexit-related effects, with incentives folding flat year over year. Wholesale volumes at 1.7 million units were up (sic) [down] 2%, driven by lower volume at our unconsolidated China joint ventures. Volumes at consolidated operations were up about 3%. Industry SAARs were up globally and in each region, with the largest growth coming from Asia-Pacific, and that was mainly China. Ford's global market share was 6.5%. That was down 60 basis points year over year, with declines in each region. This reflects mainly lower market shares in China, the U.S., and the UK. Company EBIT was $2.2 billion, down $335 million from last year. This was driven by Automotive, which delivered an EBIT of $1.7 billion, down $443 million. Now Automotive's lower EBIT was caused by commodity cost increases of about $480 million, along with adverse exchange effects of about $240 million. These effects were offset partially by higher net pricing, particularly in Europe, and higher volumes and favorable stock changes in North America. The North America stock changes reflect pipeline fill for the newly launched EcoSport and a stock build for Focus. The Focus build is to support sales after production concludes at Michigan assembly, as we begin the transition of the facility for production of Ranger. Importantly, total cost excluding commodities was about flat compared to last year. The increase in commodity cost was largely metals-driven, in part by the market's reaction to potential increases in U.S. tariffs. Nearly one-half of our full-year exposure to commodity price changes is locked in as of quarter end due to fixed contracts for hedges that we have in place. In Automotive, North America was the largest EBIT contributor, earning $1.9 billion, down $195 million. EBIT margin was 7.8%, which was down 1.1 points. The year-over-year declines were more than explained by higher commodity costs. Market factors, the combination of volume, mix, and net pricing, were positive, and total cost was flat excluding commodities. For the full year, we're guiding to lower EBIT in North America due to higher commodity cost and higher spending-related expense to support growth. We are committed to returning North America EBIT margin to the 10% level it achieved on average from 2012 to 2016 through fitness and making smart choices to play where we can win. In addition to reallocating capital to strengthen our SUV and truck portfolio, as Jim described, 51% of North America's portfolio on a volume-weighted basis will be new or significantly refreshed from the beginning of last year through 2019. The benefits of fitness actions will start to lift margins in North America next year. Outside North America in the Automotive segment, results were a combined loss of $203 million, with each region incurring a loss except Europe. The combined loss was $248 million worse than a year ago, more than explained by Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pacific's loss of $119 million was driven by a loss in Ford China. While we earned China equity income of $138 million, this was more than offset by engineering costs incurred by Ford for future products, including for newly localized entries, including Lincoln and next-generation Explorer, as well as a loss for Lincoln as we continue to establish and grow the brand and the network. The China loss was offset partially by a profit in the rest of Asia-Pacific. This includes a substantial improvement in India, although it still incurred a small loss. This improvement, of course, was achieved without the benefit we expect to see in the future from collaborating with Mahindra. We also benefited in the quarter from record first quarter sales in the Asia-Pacific markets outside of China. We expect to incur a loss in Asia-Pacific again in the second quarter, with profits returning in the second half as we begin to launch 16 new products. For the full year, EBIT will be lower, driven by our first half performance, with the run rate of the business strengthening through the fourth quarter. Now, as we announced in December, an aggressive product growth plan gets underway in Asia-Pacific later this year with the new Escort and the all-new Focus, resulting in 69% of the region's volume being all new or significantly refreshed from the beginning of 2017 through 2019. This is part of our announced plan to bring 50 new vehicles to China by 2025, including eight all-new SUVs and at least 15 electrified vehicles from Ford and Lincoln. In addition, of course, the new Zotye Ford JV will launch an all-new range of affordable all-electric vehicles. Now turning to Europe, we earned an EBIT of $119 million, which was $90 million lower than a year ago. We delivered strong net pricing increases in the quarter, but this was more than offset by lower volume and unfavorable mix, adverse exchange due to sterling, and higher commodity cost. The adverse volume and mix were due mainly to a weaker industry and lower Ford market share in the UK as well as lower demand for diesel passenger vehicle derivatives in the region. For the full year, we expect EBIT in Europe to improve from 2017 levels due to a heavy mix of new products, which should drive strongly higher net pricing. From the end of last year through 2019, Europe will benefit from an 88% volume-weighted mix of all new or significantly new products. Now, at our Mobility segment, we incurred a loss of $102 million, which was driven by autonomous vehicle development cost. Results benefited from a one-time gain on investments in smart mobility of about $58 million. The quarterly loss was $38 million worse than last year, more than explained by increased investment in autonomy. Now, if you adjust for the one-time gain, the quarterly loss would have been $160 million. This would be a reasonably good quarterly run rate this year for the Mobility segment, with about half of the projected full-year loss due to investments in smart mobility, and the remainder for AV development. Turning to Ford Credit, we saw a very strong quarter, with Ford Credit earning $641 million, $160 million higher than a year ago. The improvement was broad-based, including growth in receivables globally. In the quarter, Ford Credit's portfolio remained robust, with healthy U.S. consumer credit metrics, including an improved loss-to-receivables ratio. Auction values improved versus a year ago by about 1% at constant mix. We now expect full-year average auction values to decline just 1% to 2%. At the end of the quarter, Ford Credit's managed leverage was 8.4, in line with our target of 8 :1 to 9 :1. For the foreseeable future, we plan to maintain Ford Credit's managed receivable levels at about the same level as at the end of the quarter. Our focus is to maintain a strong risk profile for Ford and Ford Credit, balancing receivables, funding requirements, liquidity, profitability, and distributions. This will allow us to continue supporting auto sales while preserving capacity for future Mobility initiatives. It also will enable relatively consistent distributions to Ford approximately equal to Ford Credit's annual net income. For the full year, we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be flat to lower than last year as we continue to plan for lower financing margins due to rising interest rates. And while we expect auction values to trend better than our initial expectations, as I just noted, we do expect them to be down slightly year-over-year. Now turning to the company's EBIT margin, we delivered 5.2%, which was down 1.2 percentage points from a year ago. And that reflected the performance in Asia Pacific, North America, and Europe. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.43. That was up $0.03, driven by a lower adjusted effective tax rate. The adjusted effective tax rate was 9%, which includes a $235 million benefit for capital loss carryforwards. Net income was $1.7 billion, $144 million or 9% higher than a year ago, more than explained by a lower effective tax rate. Company operating cash flow came in at $3 billion, which was up $1 billion from a year ago due to higher distributions from Ford Credit. Ford's balance sheet, as Jim mentioned, remains strong, with cash and marketable securities totaling $27.6 billion and ample liquidity of more than $38 billion. Now looking at the full year, our company guidance reflects company revenue to be up modestly, company adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.70, company operating cash flow to be positive and about the same as a year ago, pension contributions of about $0.5 billion, capital spending of about $7.5 billion, and an adjusted effective tax rate of about 15%. As Jim mentioned, we expect 2018 to be the trough for company EBIT, EBIT margin, and ROIC, and the peak for capital spending. So, with that, let's now turn it back to the operator who will get us started on our Q&A session. Operator : Thank you, sir. And your first question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, everybody. Hey, Jim, first question is a Ford question. You made reference to potential disposition of underperforming businesses. Could this potentially entail exiting a geographic region? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, the short answer is we'll restructure as necessary and we'll be decisive. The decisions have lots of implications for stakeholders, so we're not ready to talk specifics at this time. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, but it sounds like it's on the table, all options on table. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yes, I want to affirm that. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Jim, my follow-up question is a bit more macro but relates to Ford indirectly. I'll let others ask about restructuring. What is your position, Jim, on raising the U.S. federal gas tax if the proceeds went to funding improvements in U.S. transport infrastructure? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: That's a creative idea. And the way I've been thinking about the transportation system in the future is that, if we cut and paste the old system as we do the kinds of things we're talking about to modernize our infrastructure, we're not going to make the progress that we really need to deal with the congestion and capacity issues in big cities. So we definitely have to in the future think about a model where we're using this cloud structure and these smart vehicles to improve that. I haven't really thought about how we fund that totally, but what we can see in the models that we're talking about with this cloud structure is there's revenue for cities in a model like that. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Jim. Operator : And your next question comes from Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, everybody. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Hi, Rod. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I wanted to also probe your comment about raising the profitability that you mentioned on slide 4. There were three buckets, the fitness improvements, alternatives, business models, and the dispositions. Can you elaborate a little bit on what the alternatives might be, when we might see those deals, how long it would take to get savings from those? And maybe \u2013 I know you're not really talking about whether these are regions or anything specific. But how big could these actions be? Are we talking about alternatives and dispositions for businesses that are a few billion in revenue, or are you reassessing tens of billions of revenue? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: I'm going to ask Bob to help with the way that we're planning this. But I would just want to I guess emphasize, Rod, that the way you think about these low performing businesses, it's been easy to identify what's wrong and what we need to do about it. And I think the hand-wringing may be that has been around in our business is gone. We're starting to understand what we need to do in making clear decisions there. So the detail in terms of the construction, I'm going to let Bob. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yes, let me start. The first thing I guess I'd want to focus on is actually the upper right. So I just want to reemphasize that the capital allocation process here is to generate incremental capital for the parts of business where we're already strong and we know we can be even stronger and more profitable, generating even higher returns. So that's the ultimate objective. If you go to the lower left, Rod, the way I would think about \u2013 let me just give you some specific examples. The first thing I want to say is this is a snapshot in time, so it's not necessarily a view of the businesses over a longer period of time, and I'll give you a couple examples. So in there is most of the Lincoln brand. As you know, that only launched in China 2.5 years ago or so. It's grown dramatically. It has a great reputation. It's getting price points consistent with the Germans in the segments in which we compete. But we're importing everything, so of course \u2013 and we're growing the business from scratch. So I've already mentioned to you that we're going to localize the first Lincoln product, but imagine the transformation of the business model, able to get out from underneath these 25% duties, the long freight journey that it takes over there and the expense and so forth, and how that can start to change how that business model looks. The second example I'd give, we've talked about \u2013 within that category is also small cars and essentially most of our MTV (33:04) type products. So we've already talked about what we're going to do in North America, so that's pretty straightforward. That's just we're not going to invest where it doesn't make sense. But a second example is the partnership with Mahindra. So is there a way in which we can participate, in this case India, where actually cars, although increasingly SUVs or crossovers, are a big part of the business, but do so in a way that builds on someone who's already very successful. Some of that may involve different segments because they're a really strong player in SUVs, but they're just really successful in general. As you heard us say, we're already improving. Imagine where we might be able to go through a deeper, closer partnership with Mahindra. And then of course, there's always fitness. Fitness is going to raise all boats. Some areas of that category would benefit from that. So it's a combination of all those things, but everything going back to the earlier response that Jim gave, everything, every tool in our toolkit is on the table in terms of addressing that part of our business. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Can you elaborate on the timing on when you would expect to disclose some of these alternative plans or deals or dispositions? And maybe just as a follow-on, restructurings of structurally challenged businesses or plants and things like that could be pretty costly in this industry. At this point, do you see all of this being accomplished with the $28 billion of cash that you have, the cash flow? Any elaboration on, aside from just framing what the savings target is, what is this going to cost? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: To your first question, and I don't want to be trite. I don't intend to be at all, but Jim did mention, there are lots of ramifications and implications from the types of things that we ultimately will do in this range of options that we have. And so what we will do is we will share with you when we can the decisions that we've made, so you can understand in a progressive manner the progress that we're making in addressing that and moving the business forward. In terms of restructuring, the first thing I would say is we do expect to continue to generate positive cash flow moving forward. So it may be pulling out as we restructure, if in fact, that's what we have to do at various points in time in various parts of the business, but it's coming in at the same time from the upper right, if you will. That's on this chart, so it's not a zero-sum game. The other thing that I would expect is that addressing this will take \u2013 it's not as if it's all done tomorrow at one time. There will be some element of time. Just go back and look at the North American restructuring, which was the last really significant one. But even the one that we did in Europe in 2011, 2012, 2013, that was over a period of time. That's just the way it works out. So I think that we certainly want to move fast and will do so, but that's what it takes. So I think the element of time probably helps us there as well. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: But again, Rod, the confidence I'd like to get across tonight is decisions aren't in pause or dwell, so the planning is the work. Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Colin Langan of UBS. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Hello, Colin. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks for taking my question. Hi, how are you? Just to follow up on the comments about cars and cutting the majority of cars in the U.S., just thinking about there in that red bubble on slide 5 where they're losing money today or any color on how large those losses are? And any color on how should we expect \u2013 are you going to close capacity? Do you expect to fill that void with all SUVs, any broad color there? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: So, Colin, let me have Jim Farley talk about the portfolio implications, and then Joe Hinrichs will talk about the industrial system that supports the same (37:19). Jim? James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: Sure, so thanks for the question. How we think about our lineup in North America especially is that we are developing incremental nameplates we don't have today and shifting the allocation of the capital portfolio to utility body styles, and there will be a variety, a growing variety, of those products. To give you a flavor, we'll have more authentic off-roaders, building our Built Ford Tough background like Bronco and other new nameplates we don't sell today. We will refresh our entire lineup of traditional crossovers and SUVs that everyone knows, like Explorer and Escape. And then we're going to be introducing and taking capital and redeploying it for also new silhouettes, products that give customers the utility benefits without the penalty of fuel economy. And they will be performance and active executed, so they'll be very emotional. So what you'll see is a whole portfolio of vehicles that will be much higher performing in terms of returns, much better for our brands, so a stronger business, and we will have a very diverse passenger car business. It just won't be traditional silhouetted sedans that tend to be commoditized. Joseph R. Hinrichs - Ford Motor Co.: So thanks, Jim. When you look at the manufacturing question, very quickly, we have a plan. We have a very high utilization rate in our North American manufacturing plants today, and we have a plan to utilize those plants and we have a product for Hermosillo to replace when the Fusion balances out. And as we've mentioned previously, the value electric SUV we're launching in 2020 also will be built in Mexico. So we have a really great plan with all the products that Jim talked about to leverage our manufacturing capacity moving forward. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it, and just last question. Your original guidance was $1.6 billion in commodity and FX, I think it was $700 million in Q1. Is it on pace, or did the steel tariffs unravel some of that, any broad color there if that's still the right number? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: I'm going to let Bob clear that up. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Based on where we are today, Colin, it looks like $1.5 billion year over year for the full year. So we had about $0.5 billion in the first quarter. So if you think about it on a year-over-year basis, progressively as we move forward, it starts to moderate a bit, which you might expect because we've now had two years \u2013 it will be two years of pretty sharp increases. So that's our outlook right now Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : So the tariffs and cost of steel price increase were incorporated in your original number? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: No, the tariffs are not assumed in the $1.5 billion. We'll have to wait and see if that happens. But we do believe that in the case of steel that it has essentially already been priced in by the market. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, that's not bad. Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Hello, Ryan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great, thanks for taking my question. Hi. Maybe just another one on where you selectively compete. Clearly you made a strategic bet on Russia, or rather stuck with Russia when it was going through a very rough patch due to its long-term potential. Obviously, markets like China, nobody's going to question, given the tremendous long-term potential. And India I think falls in that the category. And thinking about South America, how do you assess the current tradeoff there in terms of the losses you're currently making relative to \u2013 or maybe even the losses that you could make at this point in the cycle after implementing various different fitness initiatives? How do you weigh that against your assessment of that region's long-term automotive potential? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: I just want to, Ryan, make sure you know. Russia has been good for us. We actually \u2013 things have improved there. I don't want it to be left that we're stuck there. I think it's been aware to play, and I'm happy with that. I think I'm going to let Jim talk about the balance of the question around South America. James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: So if you think of our business units, North America's story is all about returning to 10%. And China's story, as you said, is all about growth. We have all these great new products. South America and Europe are improving businesses, but we are looking at our strategic plan. And so what I think is important to say at this point for South America is we have made very significant and promising progress on our strategic plan there. And we're approaching the task with the highest sense of urgency. We have a lot of teams deployed, and they're working on a comprehensive review of the business. Obviously, we have a lot of stakeholders. So we'll have more to share, more details to share at a later date. Our business is improving. We're launching new products. In fact, Cama\u00e7ari is totally maxed out right now. But we think we know that much further, more fundamental actions are required in South America. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks, that's very helpful, and then just a last question for me. Can you maybe give a couple-year walk in Asia-Pacific? Obviously, we can dissect it from your slide deck. But what has been the primary contributing factor to the softer earnings there? Relative to I think 4Q a few years ago \u2013 and there's a one-timer in there \u2013 you made over $400 million. You made nearly $300 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Maybe just how much of it do you see as cyclical or temporal in nature that you see a light at the end of the tunnel? For example, you're launching a lot of new products, versus is there something else, something you feel like you need to target the higher end of the market or more selectively target? Or you tell me, how do you turn that region around? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: I'm going to let Bob give you some of the detail. I think you got near it toward the end of your question when you think of the age of the product. There's a whole refresh that's starting in China. But, Bob, why don't you fill in? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: And then maybe if Jim has something to add afterwards. So if you go back and look at what happened, I want to start first with outside of China, because we were very challenged outside China. If you go back two or three years ago, we've seen a complete turnaround of that business through a lot of work and effort. So that is a positive story. What we've seen is weakness inside China, and I think it's around a number of different things. One is the strength of the indigenous brands certainly had an impact I think on most players in the market as they became more mature, more developed and offered a tremendous number of new products that are very attractive. We obviously were not able to keep our portfolio as fresh as it needed to be in that environment. We also saw a downward negative pricing in part \u2013 in fact, in large part, driven by the indigenous brands coming up, and that certainly affected the portfolio. We had a lot of cost reductions that we achieved in our China JVs to offset a portion of that. But then incrementally, what we saw when the Chinese government revised its policy on the renminbi, it has over time depreciated versus an appreciation trend that it had been on. And that had an impact on the business particularly given the imported elements as well as just the fact we have a very high net revenue exposure to the business. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Jim, you might talk about what's coming in China with the new vehicles. I think that's worth highlighting. James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: So where we are right now in the first half of this year, we're at the absolute trough of our product cycle in China. And over the next 24 months, we completely revitalized the lineup. As I said, it's a growth story. And it's not just all products. It's very specific products, especially utilities. In fact, today at the Beijing Auto Show, we showed the new Escort and also our brand-new Focus, which is a really high-volume product. But we're going to fill in the entire lineup of SUVs on the higher end from there. So we're really excited about the opportunity that that new launches gives us. We're also localizing Lincoln, which is a really important part of our \u2013 as well Explorer, a really important part of leveraging our profitability improvement. I also want to highlight, though, that the fitness exercises are very live for our China team. Today we launched the National Distribution Service division. That's a really important thing. We have a complex business with imported products, different divisions, and different manufacturers there. We've now gone to one company to market, distribute all of that product. It's going to be a lot more efficient, a lot more effective. And we also named our leaders for that business today, which are really experienced local team members. So I think even how we go to market is going to be more efficient and much more sophisticated with this all-new lineup. And of course, we have Zotye (46:50) right around the corner. That's a big bet for us to compete in the very value-priced BEV business, which no doubt China will be the largest electrified market in the world. So I think we're really well positioned over the next couple of years for growth and profit improvement in China. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's very helpful color, thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good evening, guys, just a first question for you, Jim. As you're going through this process of reassessing the business, and it seems like you're coming to a formulation on your thought process here. As you think about scale in the business, there seems like there's a shift in the way we all have thought about this traditionally, and some folks are backing away from pure economies of scale in their thought process in the way of thinking about structuring their businesses. Both theoretically and practically, how do you think about it as you're assessing the business? There's a lot of things that are tricky on transfer pricing that it's difficult to allocate cost correctly. So it's both a theoretical and practical exercise that's difficult to figure out. So how are you thinking about that? And is 6.5 million units something, plus or minus, you need to stick to, or could you go a lot smaller? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, let me start with the theoretical position that you asked about. So the way I think about it, the way we are thinking about it, our whole team, is that, to be a global company, you've got to have platform advantages, otherwise you don't get any scale. And so we do see platforms in the future still continuing. I think probably as we're updating our thinking about One Ford, we realize that the parallel interest and emphasis that I'm bringing about user-centered insights is that we can add to these platforms in regions region-specific characteristics of vehicles. And just that little nuance can make a big difference in the way you achieve scale, but you get share. And if we were just exporting purely vehicles that were made for North America all around the world, I'm not sure that we would be confident in that as the go-forward strategy. The good news about that is we don't disappoint any customers with a move like that. We just have to prove that we're great at building platforms that can have scale. I think the second part of it is that, if that doesn't happen, then we've got to make the decisions that you're inferring we have to make. And so that's what I meant by we're not hammering about that. We really tell ourselves what we have to believe is that we're going to get our cost of capital out to continue. The third thing is that the nature of the technology and the role that it's playing clearly in the Western markets, in Europe and North America, is going to be important, as important \u2013 more important than China based on what my visits have exposed. Their desire to have electrification is well published, but their commitment to autonomy is going to be huge. And the reason is, as you've heard me talk often about this, is the only way we can get these cities in shape is to have the system be much more choreographed to work together. It's not just the random person in a vehicle driving at any time of day expecting no friction in the way they're getting around or goods being delivered in the center of London where the commercial vehicle only has 10% of the cube being used in the truck. This is all taking up space and reducing the problem. So the technology is going to help us. I believe that there's scale in that kind of thinking as well. It's a difficult thing to design that to work, and I think Ford's going to be able to do that. Let me point out, by the way, that we're one of the very few companies that actually have the autonomous team and the vehicles teams working in tandem. There are a lot of suppliers for autonomy out there and there are a lot of OEMs, but we're only one of a handful of companies that are actually doing the work together, which we think's going to be an advantage. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, that's helpful, and maybe a more near-term practical question. Raws sound like they're becoming a bigger issue. There's some inflation. Who knows what's going to exactly happen with tariffs and inflation in the future? But is there any possibility that you share more of this with suppliers? Prior to the downturn, the majority of raws were on the balance sheet or on in the purview of the suppliers, and you guys took them on in the downturn. So is there any way to maybe shift the balance of power back on raws, maybe hold on to steel, but give everything else back to the suppliers? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Let me just \u2013 we ought to make the comment about the tariffs and the structure, which is that I've been able to talk to people, let's just say, in the world that are in leadership positions in government and say that what we crave as business people are certainty and equilibrium. So trade can thrive in a world where that's not in question. And so we have, like everyone, we're dealing with the sudden news, and I think we've done a great job internally of dealing with that. But let me also take you to \u2013 we're not going to be victims in this kind of thing. So what we're doing with building this modular architecture that underpins the vehicles helps us in addition to the last question about scale and the implications that you just asked about with suppliers. But let me ask Joe to comment on the history. I wasn't here in terms of what happened in the past and what might happen in the future. Joe? Joseph R. Hinrichs - Ford Motor Co.: Yes, Jim, thanks. First of all, over time, as Bob has highlighted on a number of calls, our raw material costs follow the curves in the market, so we have some ups and downs based on where we are in the cycle. But as you know, we negotiate our steel contracts on a quarterly basis. We spread them out so we can average things out and don't have so much risk. As far as the supply base goes, they're Tier 2s et cetera. Most of the time, they're bearing that risk. And there are occasions where we will direct-source and will be a part of the Tier 2 sourcing of raw materials. But there is some, obviously, some of the risk and reward that goes in the supply base. I'd just remind everybody that we've gotten a good balance of the upside when the commodity markets were going the other direction. So I don't see us changing our strategy dramatically with the supply base. When it comes to raw materials, we both manage the risk and reward together. But as Jim was saying, when you look at the architecture strategy and the lessons that we've learned on One Ford and the way Jim described it, there's value globally in using flexible architectures, and we've talked about our five that we're going to use. Where we've learned is really the modules within the vehicle need flexibility to be able to offer differentiation for the regional markets. And scale of the supply base occurs on the scale of the manufacturing plant locally, not on a global basis. So for example, if you have a corner module, the demand, the costs, and attributes may be different in China than they are in the U.S., but it may be the same vehicle architecture, but the module that we're going to use may be different for Asia than it is for the United States. Whereas in the past, a lot of our global platform vehicles were global across their modules as well as the platform architecture. So that's a very important nuance. Maybe it's not a nuance, but it's a very important part of our new strategy, which is to offer a catalog of modules for each of the regions to pick from for their vehicles, but still take advantage of the five core architectures that we'll use globally. So we can get the advantage of the engineering skill, the platform level, and take advantage of the local scale from the supply base and the country-specific attributes in the region. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just real quick on Ford Motor Credit, the flattening out of the managed receivables, does that mean that you guys are really looking at just generating cash flow out of Ford Motor Credit and keeping their earnings relatively consistent and flat with where they are right now, or is there something else going on? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: We're really happy with the Credit performance. Bob, you might talk about the capital structure. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: It's not an issue with Ford Credit at all. It's extraordinarily healthy and does what it does at the highest level, as J.D. Power has indicated. It's really more around managing the overall risk profile for Ford because as Ford Credit has gotten bigger and bigger and bigger, it does, even though it itself is in fantastic shape, just the nature of the business is that it represents a higher level of risk to Ford. So we want to better manage that. So that's the reason primarily that we're going to cap them at least for the foreseeable future. The benefit, and certainly that wasn't the driver, the benefit of doing that is they don't have to take the profits, the cash they generate, and then reinvest in its own growth. So as a result of that, they're able to take the profitability and the cash it generates and return it back to Ford. It certainly helps us. We also have a mind towards making sure that we do set some capacity aside at Ford Credit to support the role that it might have in the world in terms of mobility opportunities. So that's another factor that's behind that. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, that's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our last question for the evening comes from David Tamberrino of Goldman Sachs. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Hi, David. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, how are you doing this evening? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Good. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Wonderful, just a follow-up question on the modular architectures and platforms that you're talking about. Is this very similar to what VW and ultimately GM have gone down the path of? Because if I'm not mistaken, there was some significant CapEx spend in development ahead of those platforms. So I just want to marry that up with maybe net incremental savings that you're looking at over this 2019-2022 period and how much of that CapEx and spend has already been baked in through 2017 and your 2018 spend. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yes, let me sneak this in before I hand it to Joe, David, is that \u2013 and we'll directly get at that, is the thing that I \u2013 where I came from, the way I was raised is the nature of interpreting these customer demands and important user insights and the translating of that is what started to differentiate the world-class companies from those that were just trying to get more cost efficiency. The genius in this is using these architectures and giving customers exactly what they want in special ways. So I want to make sure as you're looking for this financial information that it doesn't get stated that we're running to one end of the spectrum here. The balance here is really important. But, Joe, do you want to address? Joseph R. Hinrichs - Ford Motor Co.: Sure. Thanks, David. First off, as what we started with, we see savings coming from this initiative over the next several years and significant savings, both in the engineering spend, but also in, as was highlighted, the capital expenditures related to that. Importantly, that time reduction is not just about money, but it's also getting to market faster. One of the learnings that we have in looking back over the last several years is Jim Farley and the Markets teams have great ideas for products, and we need to be able to bring those to market faster. So a very important part of this architecture and modular strategy is to be able to execute programs more quickly. So are there lessons learned from our competitors? Sure, we do benchmarking all the time, and we have learned things from our competitors. But this is a unique solution for Ford, but you will see common elements across the industry because we all learn from each other and we do a lot of analysis of each other. But I want to highlight, this time element is very important. If you think of the discussions we've had around the portfolio age in the United States and China, for example, we can help avoid those situations, those curves of hills, if you will, and valleys, by being able to execute prior programs more quickly and by reducing the cost, so therefore we can afford to do more. And that is a big part of the benefit of this initiative. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. As if I could just follow up on one more thing, as you think about the long-term strategy here, and you obviously had some announcements for China today in going into a one-distribution channel, how do you think your relationships with your JV partners could change over time, given the more relaxed stance to JV ownership trends that at least the regulators in China are opening up at this point? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks for that question. Jim? James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: Sure. We have our two JV partners. We're entering a third now. We're looking for approval for Zotye. We don't see yet. It's early days, but we have don't see those clanging. They're very important. We have a huge job to do to grow the business and improve our profitability in China. And we will absolutely drive change in that business, but we don't see a fundamental change in our JV structure. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Got it. And then finally, because you are launching all this new product in China, I'm just curious. What type of new technologies are being adopted and placed into those vehicles that's going to compete with some of the local brands that have very quickly put in incremental ADAS features and have really accelerated their product timelines to almost refreshing a new vehicle every year in order to capture incremental market share? James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: That's a terrific question. So all of our China products will be connected. It's a very important part of our strategy as a company, and there's no place more important than China. We also are working with Alibaba on connectivity and in-car experience. It would be good to get Marcy's input as well. But I think we're really learning from that customer base world leadership in infotainment. And I think the last thing I want to mention is we've made a commitment companywide, including China, and I think it's very important for our China strategy, for Co-Pilot 360. It's a whole \u2013 I think absolutely the most comprehensive ADAS assisted driving suite in the business. And that is going to be a big part of our technology story in China. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Marcy, do you want to add something about the connectivity and the potential? I guess let's think of China broadly. Marcy Klevorn - Ford Motor Co.: Sure. So we're actively talking to partners in China. Actually, my team and myself are going out next week. Stay tuned to hear more about some potential things that will happen there. And we are working closely with Jim and Joe's team on the in-vehicle experience and making sure we understand the local needs so we can deliver the best services possible and also working to launch our transportation mobility cloud in China as well. So we've got a lot going on, and it will all come together soon. Operator : Thank you, and that concludes today's Q&A portion. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Hackett. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, everyone. I want to just summarize a couple things just to remind you that in Ford's cadence, we picked this time in the fall to have a meeting with our investors. That's not a target for some restructuring or something like that. It's just the way we plan our calendar to come back to you. And we give you more detail then. It's going to be an exciting meeting. I also want you to know that, as we've said, we're committed to taking appropriate and decisive action to drive profitable growth. We need to maximize the returns of our business over the long term. We're going to be fit across the entire business. I can't understate how well this has been going as we've launched this. We've identified significant cost and efficiency opportunities, as well as you're hearing the opportunity to reduce capital intensity in our business. The cycle that we're launching we didn't want to disrupt. So it's really all the things that are happening after the launches over the next year that were able to start having an impact. And we're allocating capital to our high-performing business. And we're committed, as we've stated to Rob's question, to either fix or disposition the rest. And finally, we have a great team. I'm really happy. They're energized. They're acting with this sense of urgency and commitment. We're working really well together. And just to state it simply, we're excited about the future here at Ford Motor Company. So thanks for joining us today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation.",

Analysts: Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc. Operator : Good day. My name is Imani and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please begin. Lynn Antipas Tyson - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, Imani. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2018 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Farley, Executive Vice President and President, Global Markets. Also joining us are Marcy Klevorn, Executive Vice President and President, Mobility; Joe Hinrichs, Executive Vice President and President, Global Operations; and Brian Schaaf, CFO of Ford Credit. Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our progress relative to the value creation framework we unveiled last quarter. Bob will then review our quarter results in more detail and then Jim Farley will provide a deeper dive into our global markets. After Jim Farley's comments, we'll open the call up for questions and then following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks. Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure in the appendix of our earnings deck which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussions include forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance. Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on slide 43. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year over year. Company EBIT and EPS are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume-weighted basis. Now, let me to turn the call over to Jim Hackett. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Lynn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to honor the contributions of Sergio Marchionne, a charismatic leader who deserves praise not only for his business accomplishments but for his resolute discipline, demanding the most of himself and those around him, courage to speak plainly in the face of adversity and an unwavering commitment to his values. Our thoughts are with his family and colleagues and may Sergio rest in eternal peace. Now, please turn to slide 2. In April, we shared our framework to improve the competitiveness, profitability and returns of our portfolio and to drive sustainable value creation. This includes four smart choices for growth : A winning portfolio, commitment to new propulsion, investment in autonomous technology and advancement of Ford's role in the mobility experience. At that time and filtering for value creation, we also put a spotlight on the divergence between the accretive and dilutive parts of our business. We said we're going to feed the high performing parts and deal decisively with areas that destroy value. And we affirmed that where we can raise the returns of underperforming areas via fitness and/or alternative business models, we would, and we would disposition the rest. Today I want to provide an update on how we're moving swiftly to execute against that framework including the AV and organizational changes we announced yesterday. There's plans for restructuring that I will discuss in a moment as well as an update on our near and longer-term targets. And I'm also going to touch on our underperformance in China and Europe. So back to the growth strategy. Let me start with our commitment to cultivating a winning portfolio, and if you would turn to slide three. Now this graph, which is based on our 2017 results, and is similar to what we showed you last quarter, shows our profitability by region. It gives you a clear roadmap of where, from a geographic perspective, we have opportunities to redesign our business model. Now this redesign includes the reallocation of capital to opportunities with higher returns, restructuring and strategic partnerships. Now relative to restructuring, and mind you, we see this underneath that redesign, we now believe we have the potential for about $11 billion of EBIT restructuring charges with $7 billion of cash-related impacts over the next three to five years. It's no surprise that North America, which is solidly in the upper right quadrant on that chart, accounts for all our company EBIT. With returns of about 24%, the region earns well above our cost of capital which is evidence of our earnings power when we focus our portfolio on where we can win. And over time, North America's return profile should improve further driven by fitness and our decision we talked about last call to no longer allocate capital to traditional sedan silhouettes. Now these actions give us confidence in our target to return North America to 10% EBIT margin. Notwithstanding this quarter, Europe and Asia Pacific have been profitable but with nagging low margins and ROIC below our targeted cost of capital. Now South America, well it's firmly in the lower left quadrant with highly dilutive margin and ROIC. Middle East and Africa is in the same quadrant. However this year, that team has done an excellent job on fitness and the region now has a credible path to growth and improved returns. Now I'd like nothing better than to give you visibility into the specifics of how we may restructure, but I want you to recognize we're mindful of all of our stakeholders here, the employees, dealers, unions, regulators, government officials and investors. Therefore we only can share information publicly once decisions are made. And we followed a similar approach last quarter when we announced our decision to exit sedan silhouettes in North America, but our commitment is to keep you informed and often. When you have strong and weak franchises in regions, it's not as simple as just pulling the plug or exiting markets. We know we can capitalize on our strengths \u2013 we have a strong brand \u2013 bolster underperforming products and regions and then smartly and selectively disposition where we cannot make an appropriate return. To do this well and with grounding in the future, it takes some time, more than the year I've been in this role. As we mentioned in our earnings release, we have postponed our September Analyst Meeting. Now this was driven by the fact that we're in the midst of our global business redesign efforts. There's important partnership discussions that are taking place and because of the uncertain policy environment that we're all in. We plan to do two things : first we're going to reconvene when we have concrete details to share, but we're going to update you more certainly with touch points such as conferences and one on one meetings and daily interactions. We plan to communicate frequently. Now let me turn back to the other smart choices for growth that I've been highlighting, so turn to slide four. This is the area where we're starting with new propulsion choices. We continue to stand by our global commitment to the Paris Accord 2 degree stabilization glide path. And we're using this to guide our business. For example, we're on track to add hybrid electrics to our high volume profitable vehicles like the F-150. Our battery electric vehicle rollout starts in 2020 with a performance utility and we'll have 16 BEVs in our portfolio by 2022. Those 16 are all additions to our portfolio. In the quarter we had announced two new fuel efficient taxis, hybrid and diesel, to give operators more choice and lower total cost of ownership. We also introduced an all new Police Interceptor Utility hybrid. People said it couldn't be done. This is the industry's first pursuit-rated hybrid SUV delivering improved performance at a lower cost. Now the next area of growth is autonomous technologies. So coincident yesterday we announced the reorganization of our autonomous vehicle efforts into a single entity under the Ford Smart, Ford Mobility umbrella. This new Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC will be led by CEO Sherif Marakby. Sherif has had a long career at Ford, time at Uber, and it's an important step to provide our customers with trusted mobility services while creating long-term value for our stakeholders. This new structure, which allows for third party investments, brings together the teams who have focused on our AV development for the past 18 months with a singular focus of commercial deployment of our AV business in 2021. For your information, by 2023, we will have invested $4 billion into the development of our AV business and this includes the $1 billion we announced when we became a majority stakeholder in Argo AI. By creating this AV LLC now, we can leverage the incredible strides our development teams have already made and streamline future decision making and better capitalize on market opportunities. In the mobility segment of our growth strategy, we expanded the scope of our strategic partnerships with a new memorandum of understanding with Zotye to establish a JV to provide smart customized all-electrical vehicle solutions in China's fastest growing ride hailing market. We also signed a letter of intent with Baidu in China to jointly explore areas of cooperation in connectivity, artificial intelligence and digital marketing. And Ford Commercial Solutions introduced two new connected vehicle products to provide fleet managers and telematics service providers direct access to valuable OEM grade vehicle data. This is the power of the APIs to allow them to better manage their fleets. Let me go back for a moment to the winning portfolio. Candidly, we're extremely dissatisfied with our performance in Europe and China and we had not planned for these types of results. For each region we've identified root causes. This is why I mentioned with the winning portfolio we see issues there. And we know how to do this, the actions required to get these businesses back on track. In fact today, I've invited Jim Farley to take you through a deeper dive on this before we go into Q&A. Let me return to the announcements we made yesterday and touch on four key management changes that we announced along with the new AV LLC. As I mentioned, Sherif Marakby is the CEO of that. He will report directly to Marcy Klevorn. And Marcy had a rich history at Ford, building the software stack as our Chief Information Officer. I'm really happy that Marcy will now focus execution with this group. Joe Hinrichs will now have responsibility for IT and our global order-to-delivery system. In support of fitness initiatives, this realignment will help us accelerate the integration and application of technology across the industrial system to further streamline manufacturing, adopt big data, speed vehicle delivery times, reduce inventories and improve capital efficiency. Joe's had roles not only in setting up new businesses around the world running North America, but also was part and parcel to these important negotiations 10 years ago that helped save the company. He's got a great view of the business end-to-end and is an important assignment. Under Jim Farley's leadership, we're now embedding a deeper product line focus across the company which will allow global product line teams to put greater emphasis on customer insights and market opportunities, delivering more user driven products and services. This approach builds on the success we've already experienced with our F-Series teams in North America, the Ranger team in Asia Pacific and we've copied it with the commercial vehicle team in Europe. We're also suddenly making a linkage between the market leadership and the product leadership here. And Hau Thai-Tang, Executive Vice President of Product Development and Purchasing, will now report directly to me. This move ensures that these critical functions have an even stronger voice at our leadership table as we execute on fitness and we create the winning portfolio around the world. Okay. Turn to slide six for me please. And before I turn it over to Bob, let me say that I am confident in our plans to create a winning portfolio and execute on our other growth drivers including AV. I mean North America and Credit, the quarter they just have shouldn't be lost in our news today. They had very solid quarters. And while Europe and China are notably challenged, we're moving swiftly to stem the negative tide in both of those businesses. We've been working on this. We have line of sight to about $11 billion in restructuring with cash related effects of $7 billion over the next three to five years, which we believe will provide substantial benefits from both a growth and a profitability and return perspective. Now due largely to the performance in Europe and China, today we're lowering our 2018 EPS guidance range to $1.30 to $1.50. I'll say it again, $1.30 to $1.50 despite better than expected performance from Ford Credit and North America. I'm going to get asked this question, so let me say looking further out, we are still targeting the 8% EBIT margin and high teens ROIC by 2020. So let me at this point turn it over to Bob for more detail. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Jim. If we could go to slide eight please. Clearly as Jim said, our second quarter was challenging. This was due in part to unexpected events over which we had little control such as the fire at our U.S. supplier Meridian. It also reflects a policy environment that's increasingly uncertain, causing real unfavorable bottom line effects on the business such as higher commodity costs, beyond normal cyclical effects as well as tariff-related impacts. The quarter however also underscores the importance and urgency of the work well underway in Ford to redesign our business. And as we do this how critical it is that we consistently focus our capital on areas where we have confidence of earning an appropriate return. And where we don't we must and are addressing those issues. Thus the $11 billion of EBIT contingencies with $7 billion in cash-related effects that Jim just mentioned. It's important to highlight that we believe we can fund these cash effects without impinging on our other capital outlays including investments for growth and our regular dividend. You'll note that all of the metrics for the quarter were lower than a year ago. These declines were primarily driven by lower volume of high margin products in our North America business due to production disruptions caused by Meridian, along with performance issues in our China operations. Now at a high level, company revenue was about $39 billion. Company adjusted EBIT was $1.7 billion with an adjusted margin of 4.3%. Adjusted EPS was $0.27 and this included an effective tax rate of about 21%. And company cash and marketable securities at quarter end were about $25 billion with total liquidity at about $36 billion. On slide 10, the year over year bridge for company revenue, the $1 billion decline in revenue was more than explained by lower volume, fully explained by North America, which was the Meridian disruption, and Asia Pacific, which was mainly our China consolidated operations. All other factors improved. Turning to slide 11. The company's adjusted EBIT was down $1.1 billion from a year ago. This was more than explained by Automotive. As shown on slide 12, our Automotive operations were profitable, generating an EBIT of $1.2 billion driven by a $1.8 billion EBIT in North America. This was offset in part by a combined EBIT loss of about $600 million in the operations outside North America, with each region in a loss position except ME&A, which delivered a record second quarter profit. As shown below the graph, North America and Asia Pacific accounted for nearly all the Automotive EBIT decline due to the factors I've already mentioned. The underlying strength of our North American business came through in the quarter. As detailed on slide 15, we earned $1.8 billion with an EBIT margin of 7.4% despite the adverse impact at Meridian. The year-over-year bridge for North America, which is detailed on slide 16, shows that effectively the entire $579 million decline in EBIT was due to Meridian. It's worth looking at this bridge more closely to get a better appreciation for North America's profit trajectory supported by strong market factors. If you exclude the impact of Meridian, the favorable effect of the gain from the IPO of Pivotal and the adverse impact of the Takata settlement, North America's EBIT margin jumps from 7.4% to 9.9%, the level of ongoing margin that we're working to deliver. Now in our earnings deck this quarter, we are providing you with greater transparency into the profitability and returns of each of our business units that Jim touched on, similar to what we did on our first quarter call for the total company. The graphs show the major parts of each business disaggregated by high and low performance. As you can see in slide 17, the majority of North America's business is strong and high performing with an EBIT of $12.5 billion, a margin of 18% and a ROIC of 48%. We plan to strengthen and expand this part of our North American business and we've already begun to address the low performing parts, demonstrated by our recent announcement to no longer allocate capital to traditional sedan silhouettes. This is just one part of our effort to return North America to margins of at least 10% and to create a more resilient business. Now moving to South America on slide 19. The EBIT loss in the quarter of $178 million was unchanged from a year ago. While overall industry conditions improved and we held costs essentially flat excluding the inflationary effects, this was completely offset by the significant weakening of local currencies, particularly the Argentine peso and very high levels of inflation, especially in Argentina. As slide 20 shows, our business in South America lacks a strong competitive position or profit pillars. In fact, we have not earned an appropriate return on investment over the most recent economic cycle that spans from 2004 to the present. For those reasons, we are moving on a significant redesign of our business model focused on where to play and how to win. Turning to Europe on slide 22. Let me state plainly that we are disappointed with our performance. The loss of $73 million compares to a profit of $122 million last year. The decline in EBIT was driven by higher costs, primarily regulatory related, and unfavorable exchange, mainly sterling. While market factors were slightly positive, we had expected a much stronger boost from the top line both in volume and net pricing. Turning to slide 23. Europe similar to North America actually has a strong core product portfolio that last year represented more than 200% of the region's EBIT. This quarter consists of commercial vehicles including Ranger, our Kuga small utility and select imports. On the other hand, the low performing part of our portfolio represents a majority of our volume, revenue and capital deployed in the region, consisting principally of cars and multi-activity vehicles such as C-MAX. Clearly our European business requires a major redesign and refocus particularly given the ongoing effects of Brexit on our most important and profitable market. That work is already underway, focused on addressing the low performing elements and expanding and strengthening the healthy pillars of our portfolio. It's important to recognize that partnerships, which are a part of our fitness toolkit, are already an integral part of our European operations and going forward we expect them to play an even greater role. Let's turn now to Asia Pacific. Now effective this quarter, we are breaking China results out separately, which encompasses our unconsolidated JVs plus our consolidated operations. This provides investors greater transparency into how we are executing in this critical market and also how our business in Asia Pacific outside of China is performing. As you can see on slide 26, a summary of Asia Pacific's key metrics, we had a very difficult quarter with major year over year declines across all metrics, almost entirely driven by China. As slide 27 indicates, the year over year decline in Asia Pacific's EBIT totaled $561 million with $506 million of this coming from our China operation and $55 million from the operations outside China. At the total AP level, the year over year decline was due to lower volume and net pricing as well as lower China JV net income. Slide 28 provides the absolute and year over year details for China, with the rest of the region shown at the bottom. We are very disappointed in our performance in China. We lost $483 million in the quarter, a decline of $506 million from last year. The decline was driven by unfavorable market factors for Ford and Lincoln imports into China and continued negative industry pricing. The lower net pricing also includes adverse stock accrual effects driven by price changes in response to tariff changes. The decline in the China JVs was driven by unfavorable volume and mix as well as lower net pricing, which was primarily industry related. Since volumes in the JV were down year over year, we also saw a decline in royalties in compensation for engineering expense that Ford incurred in the past. Given the large increase this year in Ford engineering expense to support a substantial expansion of our product portfolio, including all new BEVs along with a number of imported products to be localized, the gap between Ford incurred engineering expense and present-year royalties we receive from the China JVs is substantial. As shown below the chart, the operations in Asia Pacific outside China were profitable, earning $89 million, which was down from a profit of $144 million a year ago. The EBIT margin was 4.2%. This decline was driven by unfavorable market factors, mainly in Australia and ASEAN. India continued to improve, although it did incur a modest loss. As slide 29 shows, in 2017, Asia Pacific had a meaningful, high performing business anchored by Ranger, most utilities, Mondeo and Mustang. Moving forward, we're focused on getting our China business back on track, including localization of most imported products, sustaining the strong performers in the region outside of China, and getting appropriate returns from our business in India. India is another example of where we're leveraging partnerships, specifically Mahindra, to strengthen our competitiveness. Now turning to slide 30. Our Mobility segment including mobility services as well as autonomous vehicles, we saw EBIT loss of $181 million, which was down $118 million with both the absolute loss and the year over year variance split about equally between mobility services and investments in autonomous vehicles. Ford Credit had another strong quarter as shown on slide 31, with modest growth in receivables, earning before tax of $645 million, up $26 million with very strong credit and consumer metrics. Auction values in the quarter were up 4% from a year ago, and we now expect full-year average auction values to be up 1% to 2% at constant mix. Operating cash flow in the quarter detailed on slide 34 was a negative $1.8 billion, which was driven by unfavorable working capital and timing differences. The balance sheet remains strong as does our liquidity. And finally as shown on Slide 37, the company adjusted EPS bridge, we have updated our full-year guidance from a range of $1.45 to $1.70 to a range of $1.30 to $1.50. Based on the midpoint of each range, the decline of $0.18 or about 11% reflects lower than expected contributions from Asia Pacific and Europe offset in part by stronger performance from North America, despite taking a substantial hit on commodities and Ford Credit as well as a slightly lower adjusted effective tax rate of 13%. With that, I'd now like to turn it over to Jim Farley, who's going to share insights on our North America, Europe and China businesses. Jim? James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, Bob. Well it's great to see the progress in North America. In fact this morning, J.D. Power has reported the results of the annual APEAL survey and for the first time in history, a domestic product won the top score, the Lincoln Navigator. Beyond the products, the 10% margin has galvanized our team in North America. Our performance in the quarter reflects the underlying strength of our current portfolio and mix of trucks and the intense focus the team has on fitness. You can feel the momentum. We have built strong, profitable, competitive moats like our LCV business. F-Series and Transit make up the industry leader in commercial vehicles, thanks not only to the product but our distribution and commercial capabilities. Our F-Series this year is on pace for a record setting year with sales up 5% and equally strong pricing despite an incredibly intense competitive market. Talking about the revitalization of our utilities, our first big launch, the Expedition/Navigator, well, sales are up 55% and we are having even stronger results on pricing. All of this is before we refreshed 75% of our North America lineup next year, mostly utilities. We know that when we play to our strengths for customers, we drive strong profits and returns. In contrast, the erosion we've seen in both Europe and China is unacceptable, highlighting why we are changing our portfolio in these regions to profitably grow. Turning to Europe and our deteriorating results. Despite being only 30% of our revenue, our LCV business continues to be the bright spot, with 13% EBIT margins. This reflects our strong core portfolio with Ford as the number one best selling LCV brand, led by Transit and our vans and Ranger which is now the best selling pickup in the region. But despite this strength, one of our underlying issues is that we are behind on the shift to utilities and now our portfolio under index on this highly profitable and growing segment. The biggest issue we face is the UK. We're the number one brand in the market. Back in 2016 we made $1.2 billion in Europe and most of it was in the UK. Brexit and the continued weak sterling has been a fundamental headwind for our European business. This explains the majority of our deterioration along with the age and mix of our utilities and cost. Taking all of these factors into account, we now expect to deliver a loss this year in Europe. To deliver on our long-term target of 6% EBIT margin, clearly we have to redesign Europe, centering the operations on our profitable LCV business. We are aggressively attacking costs and driving improved capital efficiencies across the business. Importantly, capital allocation plans now align with utility and the LCV business opportunity. Turning to China. The deterioration of our business in this important global market has been swift. When we completed the deep dive into the root cause, we exposed serious shortfalls in our go-to-market capabilities, including inadequate dealer profitability, excess stock including our high volume C cars. We now maintain we haven't maintained a fresh enough product lineup for this rapidly changing and dynamic China market. These missteps together, with our uncompetitive cost structure has resulted in a significant deterioration in our 2Q results. We have taken urgent action. We've addressed the dealer profitability, also our stock and production and we've completely reset our merchandising. New products are on their way. 60% of our lineup will be refreshed or new by the end of next year. However until all of our utilities are launched in China, we'll continue to face this mix deficit. We are improving our cost competitiveness with aggressive fitness actions as well as more localized product, as Bob said in China, such as the Explorer. We're close to hiring a new CEO for Ford China and we have already onboarded a number of local Chinese talent in key management positions such as marketing and sales leads for both Ford and Lincoln to drive not only our strategy but they're already reinvigorating our sales. China is already the world's largest automotive market, growing to twice the size of the U.S. market by 2025. And I can assure you, we understand the importance of getting our China business back on track. This will complement the progress we've already made in the region with ASEAN and Australia thanks to Ranger and India as Bob mentioned with the work we're doing with Mahindra. Before we open the call to Q&A, I'd like to end on this. Bob mentioned the sizable provision for restructuring contingencies of $11 billion and $7 billion of cash-related effects. With this and other fitness actions, we are determined to reshape our portfolio of products and markets. Complementing this is our aggressive reallocation of capital to regions but products that people love in the most profitable segments. We're expanding our incredible lineup of Ford commercial vehicles. We're growing the range of white hot utilities, not just Expedition, but in all sizes and price points. And we're completing the build-out of an incredible urban crossover lineup with world class energy efficiency. Operator, let's go to the Q&A. Operator : Certainly. Okay, your first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks everybody. Just got two questions. First one on restructuring. I want to ask the question, what does $12 billion, I'm sorry, what does $11 billion of charges or $7 billion of cash charges buy you in the restructuring world? But am I wasting everyone's time here? Are you going to \u2013 is there anything else you can say in terms of geography, function, region? Anything else tonight besides the number? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah hi, Adam, Jim Hackett. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: No we're not going beyond that tonight. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Tonight's not the night for that. Okay, all right. The second question, Jim, is to you. I think the postponement of the Capital Markets Day, it's kind of a pretty big deal, Jim. These types of things you're introducing into the strategy like spending $11 billion over three to five years, dealing with key stakeholders, tech partners, revamping China. It requires someone to be in the seat a fair amount of time to see it through. So to be direct with you, Jim, whenever you do reschedule the Capital Markets Day, to be clear with investors, will you be the one delivering the message or will someone else be doing it? And I mean that with all due respect. You're a very spry 63 and you've got great contributions to the culture and to accelerating cultural change. But I think it's important, and I'm kind of reflecting a fair amount of sentiment in the investment community around management continuity as well. So we really would appreciate a comment on that. Thank you. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, thank you, Adam. It's a straightforward. I love the job that I have. We're making tremendous progress. I get to look. This is a year ago that we had our first quarterly call and I've looked back and what we said we would do. We've made tremendous progress. We've made a number of decisions. In fact, a few are worth emphasizing. One is this product portfolio turnaround, all the work. Of course, as you know the industry, Adam, these are decisions that will fuel growth and profits in the future. I'm not blaming anyone in the rearview mirror, but I had nothing to do with the portfolio that we're now kind of laboring under in a couple markets. And we've taken really decisive action to address all of that. The second thing is, the fitness initiatives which we introduced, kind of an abstract word, everyone wasn't sure what it meant, we now have earmarked over $11 billion of value. We've started to work on our longer-term planning and we're expecting more to come from that. So it's had more traction than I first forecasted. The third thing is, is this team has really come together. I feel like, in any kind of endeavor I've been in, it takes time for a group of people to come together and work closely. You heard with these management choices. I'm really proud of the group that I have on side-by-side with me. And hell yes, I expect to be in front of everybody declaring where we're going and what we want to get done. So I think there should be zero question about that. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Could I just comment on the question around restructuring? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah and so, Adam, we can talk more about this later, but I think you're raising a really important point and I just want to make sure that investors and others who are listening understand why we shared what we did today. So first of all, you should expect that we will be using the earnings calls and other interactions that we have with you and investors and buy side, as things take place and as we can share what our thinking is and our plans and actions, we're going to be doing that real-time. So what I want to leave with you is this. If you go back to the prior quarter and the what I call, the bubble chart which is the high performing, low performing which we provide for the total company. And then you look at what we're providing today, which is like a next step forward. So we're showing you what that looks geographically. We've also shown you within each region where we have high performing and low performing parts of the business. The way I would encourage you and investors to think about all of that is, those are, if you will, roadmaps, not specific to the degree I understand you would like to see, but they are roadmaps. They are roadmaps in terms of the strong business that fits inside what, in the aggregate is a somewhat mediocre business, because of the low performing elements that we still have. But it's a roadmap in terms of where we're going to allocate more capital to. It's also a roadmap, in general, of where we're going to allocate capital from. So as you can imagine, that is a complex thing to do in terms of over the whole business. We're going to have to orchestrate this. It will play out over time. There are many constituencies that we're going to have to manage, because while those numbers that we gave you are large and substantial, they could be even larger if we don't manage this in the right way. I mean, we'd like them to be smaller, so we're going to not, if you will, tip our hand before we need to so that we can manage this in the most efficient and effective way that's possible. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I appreciate that, Bob and listen, Ford's a 115 year old company. It's not your first rodeo here in terms of restructuring over that 115 years. I just can't really think of an example where, for such an important restructuring and such large numbers, and you're kind of almost teasing the market with these very large numbers. Even not just for investors, but internally for your own people who are going to read the newspaper and say, what's going on. I mean, doesn't \u2013 I'm just, I'm concerned that and seeing examples of people that restructured successfully, including one we lost today, laying it all out in a narrative that can be understood, that can be on the back of a card, like from the Mulally days. That had a powerful impact, because I think the risk is that this industry is so dynamic, possibly yeah, very, very dynamic and cyclical that as that narrative plays out, the rules change, your free cash flow moves negative. And then we're dealing with a moving bar and we don't know what to compare it to. Sorry, that's just feedback. I really do hope you can reconsider the communication strategy because it's just not good enough, Bob. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: No, I understand what you're saying, but let me just provide another, yeah, a few other thoughts for you and others to think about. So one reason that we wanted to provide it is because we have been doing a lot of work in terms of how we're going to redesign the business. We clearly have a point of view, maybe not complete yet, because we still have a lot of more work to do, but we have a point of view about what that redesign is going to entail. We're not providing the specifics for the reasons I mentioned, but it's clear that that redesign is going to be fundamental and it's going to be deep and it's going to really address these underperforming parts of the business. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: The other thing I would remind you is we've been to the rodeo. If you go back 10 years, a number of guys that are sitting around the table and gals went through an enormous restructuring with similar types of numbers if not bigger in the restructuring of North America. And I was there on the day that Mark provided the first view of what The Way Forward plan was going to be. It was high level. We talked about numbers of plants that we might close. I actually looked at the details today. It turned out some of those plants were different. Some of the plants that we were going to close we didn't, and some that we ultimately closed, we didn't think we were going to. And the thing that's interesting about this and this is another thing that's important for investors to understand, because everybody wants to have the answer today. When we announced that in January of 2006, the last two plants, which we didn't identify at that time that closed were in 2011 when we closed Twin Cities which built the Ranger and St. Thomas in Canada where we built the Crown Vic, the Grand Marquis and the Town Car because it was the right time to do that. We were able to run them out, generate the cash flow, and manage that in the appropriate way. That is exactly the same approach that we're going to take now. Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Bob. Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. Next we have a question from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm going to ask a question on the $11 billion of restructuring charge and $7 billion of cash outlay in another way. So I understand you're working on a variety of possible actions that you're not ready to disclose including because they may not be finalized, you have a variety of stakeholders and it might not be value maximizing to announce these actions sooner rather than later such as plans to exit a country or a region et cetera. But with that said, now that you have disclosed the potential costs of restructuring, can you also disclose the potential benefits? So for example, what is the return on the $11 billion or the $7 billion? What is the payback period on that investment? What is the improvement to margin and free cash flow that that spending could bring about? Are these costs simply necessary to achieve your targeted 8% EBIT margin and high teens ROIC, or does this take you above and beyond the 2020 targets? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, so let me respond to that. So the way that I would think about that, Ryan, and obviously we'll provide more as we can as I mentioned earlier in the Q&A with Adam, think about it this way. We're showing you substantial parts of the business where we get extraordinary margins. And we've told you that we're only going to allocate capital to new investment opportunities going forward that generate the appropriate returns on capital. In the process, we will either move the low performing parts of the business through fitness or other means in the lower left quadrant up or we will dispose of them. So if you think about what that business looks like, it's going to be a business that rocks. It's going to be a business that generates very strong operating margins just as we do in North America and very, very strong returns on invested capital. It will look different. It will be different but it will be a much stronger business. And that's exactly what's behind the restructuring charges that we've shared with you today as the, if you will, the creation and the design of that new business. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then the last topic area I want to explore is Asia Pacific. So just looking at the China EBIT bridge on slide 28, and you'll have to correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think the way to interpret this chart is that the change in China equity income is reflected in the JVs category. And then the volume/mix and net pricing comes to the left of that relate to I guess consolidated China operations. Is that right? And if so, I had not realized that your consolidated operations there were material enough to result in that type of a swing factor, $141 million from volume/mix, $101 million from net pricing. Maybe Bob can help me understand that. And then secondly, Jim, I remember meeting with you shortly after 1Q results and you seemed pretty excited about the potential financial contribution of refreshing something like 80% or 90% of your portfolio in China this year. After your sales performance and profitability in China in 2Q, how are you feeling about the ability to benefit from those launches? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Let's let Jim Farley take that part first because I'm going to have Bob come back to the way the accounting is coming through. Jim? James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, thanks for your question. We have 16 launches in China, all of them in the second half, so we are still very optimistic about the impact of those launches. We have addressed the go-to-market capabilities and gaps that we've seen and dealer profitability etcetera. Most of the launches like the new Focus or new Escort are sedan silhouettes and most of the profit uplift for us and others is really around utilities. So as we build out in 2019 and 2020 the whole new lineup of utilities in China, that's when we're going to get the lift. So it's going to be great to see that revenue build in the second half. The profit will come with our utilities. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: So let me answer the first part of the question Ryan. And that question is exactly why, really it's one of the reasons why we wanted to start disclosing China the way that we are, because of the significance of what goes on outside the joint ventures which is all that we disclosed previously. So you're correct in your understanding that the JV is the $192 million decline that you see in the call-out box under the JV column. We've put against that the royalties because they come from the JVs. And you can see that they're giving us less on a year over year basis because of the volume decline. So when you think about the rest of the business and the consolidated business, think about it in normal situations we would see a good return, a good profit coming from the Ford imports and the major factor there would be the Explorer, which we've already announced we're going to localize. We have losses for Lincoln, no surprise because we've just started over the last several years to establish it. It's off to a good start. We even grew in the first quarter again. And that business model changes when we begin to localize, which starts in 2019. In fact, if anything, the business case is even stronger with the level of tariffs that we have today. The piece that you don't see and that's changed and that should change in a positive way as we move forward is around what I call net engineering expense. So Ford Motor Company engineers for the joint ventures today and we get compensation for that product when it comes to market and they start building it, let's say, three or four years from now. So there's a lag between the two. Jim has talked about the fact that we've got a big product onslaught that's underway, including BEVs, a much stronger lineup of SUVs, quite a number of products coming. So let me just give you a couple of things that will dimension this for you. If you go back to the 2015, 2016, 2014, 2015, 2016 period, the balance between the engineering that Ford incurred in the current year and the royalties that we were receiving from the joint ventures was pretty much balanced, 50/50, so there was no net impact, if you will, on the bottom line because the expense was offset by the royalties. In 2017, as we began this onslaught of engineering, if you will, for this big expansion of the portfolio, it started to tilt out of balance because we started to invest much more heavily in terms of engineering. But that's for products and an expanded portfolio that comes in years ahead. So we started to tilt out of balance in terms of net expense, net engineering expense. That net engineering expense this year, in an absolute sense, is about $600 million. So we've gone from balance to a negative net engineering expense of $600 million, and that's a $300 million increase on a year over year basis, which is part of the headwinds that we were facing. That's not part of the guidance change because we had expected that, but that is definitely a major, major factor in terms of the absolutes that we're looking at. As we move forward and the engineering becomes more normalized and we start to see the volumes grow coming from the expanded portfolio, our expectation is that we go back to a much more balanced position, which will be part of the improvement that takes place over time in the China consolidated business. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I see. Thanks for the explanation. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Talk about North America. How are you thinking about the back half competition from GM and FCA? They both had pickup truck related headwinds due to their changeovers in the first half. And I think both of them today said they're targeting approximately 100,000 increases from 1H to 2H in their wholesales. So how are you thinking about that increased supply coming into the market for pickup trucks? And are you anticipating any pricing pressure or again that incremental competition for Ford North America in the second half of the year? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Jim? James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: Well, we're really confident about our leadership position in the truck market. Obviously, we have very new product. Super Duty is doing extremely well. We have good stocks, but they're on the low side. We've had great transaction price improvements despite the sell down of multiple brands' trucks. So we continue to expand our sales and unit volume. We have a refreshed product. As you know, we have the diesel F-150 at 30 miles per gallon, which is great for merchandising and for customers. We have the new Raptor coming, which is very popular and a significant part of our mix now and Super Duty just continues to get traction. Customers seem to really appreciate the powertrain improvements of F-150 including the 10 speed transmission and the other changes we made. So we think we're in great shape. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. So no anticipated headwinds. Pickup trucks continue to be strong for Ford. All right. My second question just on the Ford Autonomous Vehicle unit that was announced. How is that business currently capitalized in terms of cash that's been allocated to it? How are you thinking about potential third-party investments? How imminent could that be? Have you been approached? Are you approaching anyone, or is that more just setting it up down the road for potential investments? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Dave, this is Jim Hackett. Let me confirm that setting this up does a number of things for us. If you look at the slide 38, it's on the right, this is the part you probably wouldn't see if you were peering into Ford where all the capabilities that we've been in the middle of managing, we now tie that together. And then the monetization on the other side, which is the promise of this whole business, which many of you have written about. This is expanding in terms of interest. Lots of people of course in other parts of our industry have received capital. So we've had people approach us. We're not disclosing any of that tonight, but yeah we've had interest. And I would just suggest to you a couple things. One, there's not going to be 10 winners in this space when we look back. There's going to be a few and we plan on being one of them. And we can look at the computer industry in a similar evolutionary way to see what happened as it took off. Two, the Argo AI team, we just met with Bryan today, is really making progress. In fact the velocity of the way the vehicle learns, you got to think about the compounding that you know about from miles driven. The velocity of its learning is faster than some of the chip capabilities that we contract for, which said another way is we're already advancing the neural network learning of this system beyond what people thought it might do, which is great because that's what it has to have in order to be safe and deployable. The third thing is that we've committed in our plan $3 billion of additional dollars. But that's a fair question to ask if there's more. And, Bob, I'm going to let you address that. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, in terms of the funding, we are setting it up obviously as a separate legal entity. We've done the same thing with Ford Smart Mobility, so there's optionality there. And it is to allow for other partners or participants in the future. We will be establishing a balance sheet if you will for them, but for now it will be funded internally. And I wouldn't disclose any details around that. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. I'll follow up later with a few more. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good evening, guys. Maybe just to follow up on this large spend of $7 billion in cash, $11 billion in EBIT. Bob, as you think about this as a CFO sort of philosophically, with maybe not even getting into details, I mean is this the kind of thing that you look at as an 18 to 24 month payback on a standard basis, or is this a sort of a much more holistic turn in the company to something that is totally different than what we're looking at right now? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, what I expect it to do is basically to, if you will, we've got anchors. We swim in the water with ankle weights, big ones. And what we want to do is we want to get them off so that the real underlying strength of this company can come through. And I can tell you it's kind of interesting. Again, I went back and looked at \u2013 I actually kept all this stuff. I'm not supposed to. I think it's way past the time, but I kept all the files from back in 2005, 2006, and I was looking at the projections that we made of what would come out of what we called The Way Forward plan. I mean, it paled in comparison versus what we actually delivered. So the power of what this company can bring in terms of returns if it just invests in the right things in the right way and just releases the anchor weights that we historically have carried around with us for whatever reasons will be tremendously powerful. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And that's where I want to sneak in to Adam and Ryan and all of your questions about how long have those weights been on those ankles. And so this is a credit to the team. In a very short time we're making decisions, planning. We're going to do this very thoughtfully, but with dispatch. And so I'm really proud of that and I'm a little mystified why that doesn't come through, because this, in previous calls, this was the question, are you really going to be candid, Jim, and take a deep look at things, and how quickly will you come to conclusions and what actions will you take? I do understand that it's fair that you want to know what kind of returns these bring and so we plan to update you on that. But I think this hard work has really happened, and so I'm happy where we stand tonight with what we know. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So it sounds like you've identified sort of the outperforming products and the underperforming products. So if we look at the rough 6.5 million units of global volume that you have on a consolidated basis, I mean, are we looking at a third of that being sort of the high performing, a third being low performing and one-third in the middle being sort of stuff that you can fix and move up? I mean, what are the rough numbers? I mean, are we going to see potentially significantly lower volume in the future? Is the 6.5 million going to be 4 million or 3 million? Is that the kind of stuff that's going on in the thought process? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, we're looking at that. I mean obviously, when you go market-by-market, and we even provided a few specific comments today that would tell you in certain regions that the majority of volume or revenue is actually low performing. We haven't done that across the board. But your supposition, John, is correct in terms of the magnitude of what we're having to address. But what I would also remind you is that there's a capital reallocation to new things. So while certainly, some things will be left behind and they should be, there will be new things that we'll be investing in that actually are already more friendly to us, we're already strong, and we see ways that we can expand our portfolio in those areas, both if you will, from a horizontal standpoint as well as vertically. And also Jim is working to identify and get ahead of future trends and try to get us in the forefront of providing products to address those consumer needs, so we don't find ourselves in the future in the situation where we're under-indexed, for example, in utilities in many parts of the world where so many customers have moved. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And I would add to that, Bryan, or John, that the fitness initiatives, which we've talked about, we've identified 19 of these. Those have come in richer than we originally projected. And so I'm going to assert here that as you stare at the volume as you do and you start looking at the profit performance of the business, it's still realizing lots of value that comes from these fitness initiatives. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, Jim, you've got a great management team underneath you with Joe and Jim and Marcy and a whole bunch of other people. The plans keep shifting and it's kind of difficult to operate in that kind of environment. Is there any risk of retention or any idea to go out with retention packages, because it sounds like this is going to be a pretty big tear up, and you want to make sure. I mean, it's a great team. You want to make sure you keep them together. How do you think about human capital in this equation? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: It is the center of gravity. And so the company, yeah, the company has addressed that and it's an important thing. In fact, it's so important, it's the kind of thing I discuss with the board quarterly just so that everyone's on the same page about how important these people are to us. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just lastly, Bob, when you looked at the outlook for cash flow, it didn't have the term but still positive. Is that still part of it? I mean, you're saying just the operating cash flow lower year over year versus 2017 but the still positive clause was taken out. Is that reading too much into it or? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: No, no, I'm laughing because I looked at the slides this afternoon. I said, oh, I forgot to add that. Yes, positive cash flow but lower than last year. Thank you for asking that. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Still positive. Okay. Thank you so much. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Appreciate the question. Operator : Okay. We will now take our last question from Mr. Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. We had a lot of discussion around strategic repositioning and restructuring, and I guess we're not going to get more answers there. So instead I want to kind of ask a question more about just the week to week operational management in the quarter and how comfortable you are between the two Jims, Joe, Bob, that you're on top of these issues in Europe, China as they develop. I go back to in May, you reaffirmed your guidance despite the Meridian fire, which indicated things were on track in North America, but probably more broadly, there are at least no surprises or at least other offsets and now we have this. So can you give us a sense just, A, of kind of what really changed so rapidly towards the end of May and June? And B, whether you feel, because I know having been a consultant, it's easy to get to spend a lot of time planning with the five years out and forgetting about the five weeks out, how you make sure that part of the business is running well? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, there's a huge commitment to that. I mean, the way the company thinks about this, we think about it in time phases of now, near and far and each one of them gets attention. I think that from a now perspective, we really know our business. We know where profit's coming from, where the challenges come from. I think when you stare at the China problem, we're taking full responsibility for what we would do differently with that. And it does go back to the things we've been saying, is that there was some what I would call weak signals that became profound about the product acceptance in China, Ford products and the aging. There were some things about the partnerships that need tuned up. We are a new team and we're committed to these folks and our dealers. So I'm confident. This is why I said this in my comments, that the things, Brian, that you wonder slipped away here, we actually know how to do. We've got really good people and know how to fix this. There is a sense, I just want to show you the humility of this, China is a really competitive market, hypercompetitive, 20 to 30 competitors that we didn't have a decade ago that are indigenous. So, but I love a challenge like this. I think that our ability to understand customers and use and translate that into product is going to be one of the big pillars of our recovery. As you think about though, the questions all the way through that time phase of just what we work on now, you can't forget the future. And in the middle of this, we've all been dealing in industry and business with trade and shifts in that regard. I'm really confident the team's been great at dealing with that. If you think about North America, we had all the effects, because we have supply at a higher percentage from North American steel than any of our competitors, same with aluminum. And here we are recording the kind of margins that we're seeing today. So I'm really happy with the unexpected events. A fire hits the company, and it's amazing, amazing what the people at Ford did to turn that around. And you see the extent of what it could have done to damage our business, and we think we're going to actually recover by the end of the year there. So this is just an endorsement that these kinds of things aren't hard for us to manage. And I'm confident that I really believe in everybody here and our ability to address all these things. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And in terms of what led to guidance reaffirm to guidance cut? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I mean, you've had a long day in that regard, right, in terms of as you stare at the industry. So I think the headwinds relative to some of these unexpected things are why we've got to have confidence that this isn't being upended by trade and tariffs and things like that. I'll just make a statement that, I've said this before, the trade structures always have existed. And the best times that you can see business perform inside trade is when there's equilibrium. And forget for a moment who's winning and who's losing. Just think about you design your business to the certainty of that. So all of us are learning how to kind of deal with that unexpected nature. And who can speculate how long the uncertainty will stand? But we're ready to deal with it. I think when you think of Brexit, for example, it's probably lost in our reporting how profitable the UK normally is for us. And I'm reading about other aerospace companies who want to have you still waiting to see the evolution of that trade structure so they can make decisions. What we're telling you today with the forecast of the charges for restructuring, we're going ahead and starting to deal with the effects of all these things in a way that we get more control of our future. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just finally, are you through the WLTP changeover or is that going to pressure third quarter schedules as well? James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: That's a great question. We're through all of our past year cars. We have just S-MAX, Galaxy to go. We still have the commercial vehicles to go. It was definitely a lot of extra workload on the team, not only us, but also the homologation teams, but we are through it now. It's not a material impact to us as a company financially. We've probably had 0.1% or 0.2% maybe lost just because the delay in getting homologation done in terms of our sales. But we're on track and steaming along, which is really important for our light commercial lineup. Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you. Lynn, so I'd like to just make some closing comments. Thank you everyone for joining us again today. We're committed, as you've heard over and over, that we're taking appropriate and decisive action to drive profitable growth, maximize returns of our business over the long term. We're through this process of identifying opportunities by region to redesign our business model. We are actively reallocating capital to areas where we can generate the higher returns including understanding restructuring and strategic partnerships. Remember, we've announced a few of these. There is a sense of urgency in the company. We're committed to this EBIT margin target of 8%, the high teens ROIC in 2020. And we realize that the China and Europe performance need to be clearer to you and to us in terms of a positive future. So thank you for following Ford and thank you for joining us today. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Analysts: John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Operator : Good day. My name is Ian, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford Motor Company Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-answer-session. I would now like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please begin. Lynn Antipas Tyson - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, Ian. Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Jim Farley, Executive Vice President and President, Global Markets; Marcy Klevorn, Executive Vice President and President of Mobility; Joe Hinrichs, Executive Vice President and President of Global Operations; and Brian Schaff, CFO of Ford Credit. Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our progress relative to the value creation framework we unveiled earlier this year, which we now call Creating Tomorrow, Together. Bob will then review our quarter results in more detail and then we'll open the call for questions. Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks. Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussions include forward looking statements about our expectations for future performance. Actual results may differ from those stated. And the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on slide 35. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year over year. Company EBIT, EPS and operating cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume-weighted basis. Now let me turn the call over to Jim. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Lynn, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I'll briefly cover three topics before I turn it over to Bob for more detail and then we'll take your questions. First, let me provide an overview of third quarter results and our 2018 guidance, which remains unchanged. And then second, I'd like to share with you specific detail on the progress we're making against our strategy to create value for all of our stakeholders. And then third, I want to provide a look ahead at a number of upcoming touch points we'll have with investors and provide an update on our midterm guidance. So let's get started. If you would, please turn to slide 2. Starting with the quarter, top line grew 3% in the face of significant global sector-wide headwinds and our company EBIT margin was sequentially unchanged, despite substantially lower volume. Our North America performance was strong with an EBIT margin of nearly 9%. And I have to say that the North American leadership team has done a great job optimizing every opportunity to improve growth and returns. And now, we're heading into a really busy and exciting period of product renewal, which you'll hear more about. I believe North America results demonstrate the early evidence that our fitness actions and commitment to focus on higher return opportunities are now taking hold and this is driving a more resilient business model. Within North America results this quarter, we achieved a $1 billion mix improvement from our strong product line focus, including more F-150s and more Super Duties that had record transaction prices. And additionally, the F-Series share of the full-size pickup segment increased in the quarter and Ford continued to be the number one best-selling brand in the U.S. We also remain the number one selling brand for commercial vehicles in Europe. In fact, we gained commercial vehicle share, reaching our highest quarterly share in over 25 years. In addition, we delivered record year to-date sales of Ranger in Asia Pacific. I'm delighted that our earlier proclamations that we can find that right winning portfolio has this positive news in the quarter. Our future work on our portfolio is directed at making this even better. In addition, Ford Credit quarterly results were the best since 2011. We delivered positive company operating cash flow and we generated earnings per share of $0.29. Our balance sheet and available liquidity remain at healthy levels. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating. In the quarter, we had over $23 billion of company cash and our target balance of $20 billion with liquidity over $34 billion. Well, turning to the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our EPS guidance of a range of $1.30 to $1.50 and positive cash flow, albeit lower than 2017. So now let's go to page 3. This framework, which we have shown before, illustrates our plan for creating value for our stakeholders. At the highest level, the obvious strength of our F-Series trucks and our Transit family of commercial vehicles has positively driven margin in recent years. When I look back at these successes, there's not much I would have wanted to change. But it's clear these strengths probably masked weaknesses in the fitness of our overall business and also shrouded poor design elements of other areas of the business where we destroyed value. To be a great company, my message to everyone is, we have to attack this opportunity. In answer to the question, what have we again been working on this past year? We've developed and implemented a plan to redesign the company to dramatically improve the fitness of the overall business, address those areas of weakness I just pointed out and prepare Ford to win in a fast-changing future. Our mission is to build on our traditional strengths, while capitalizing on the sweeping changes brought about by propulsion technology, shared mobility and artificial intelligence that are all ushering in an era of smart vehicles for a smart world. Now this transformation is predicated on the best and highest use of our capital across four growth drivers. Now earlier, I mentioned the efforts on creating and bringing to market a winning portfolio, so let me start with that. At a high level, we plan to fortify and grow our leading position in trucks, our leading position in commercial vehicles and performance vehicles such as the Mustang. Despite our heritage in SUVs, we know we're not the leader in this space, but we certainly are a solid player. Customers consistently rave about products like the Ford Explorer and the new Lincoln Navigator. This is a multibillion dollar opportunity and we're moving with urgency to leverage our SUV expertise and brand image to become a global leader in utilities. This drives clear choices, like our decision to phase out sedans over time in North America. Not only are customers increasingly migrating to different silhouettes, but also because of their lack of profitability, these traditional sedans destroy value. And we can reallocate that capital to higher return opportunities. This decision means new entries in the utilities, trucks and white space vehicles with new silhouettes that will be more attractive to customers, while delivering higher returns. Last week, my team and I hosted almost 4,000 North American Ford dealers in Las Vegas and we showed them how our lineup of nameplates will grow in the next five years versus where we are now. Overall by 2020, we expect 75% of our lineup in the U.S. to be new or refreshed. In fact, I hope you saw the new Built Ford Proud ad campaign we launched this past weekend to support this product push. To deliver this fresher, more vibrant lineup around the world, it's not enough just to reallocate capital to higher return opportunities, though. We also have to improve in two key areas, engineering efficiency and product line management. And both of these will deliver huge benefits downstream. You have heard Hau Thai-Tang, our executive over product development explain how we're moving to five flexible global architectures that will give us the ability to deliver more product faster and with that less capital. We believe that we can reduce the time it takes from sketch to showroom by 20%, while improving capital efficiency by an additional 20%. In addition, we have implemented new product line management teams. These are agile cross-functional teams; they're responsible for product lines from end to end, including P&L. This brings us much closer to our customers and their wants and needs. We have established clear lines of responsibility for every product line with the mandate to deliver appropriate level of returns. The next area of focus is propulsion and we use that term not to confuse you, but because we're going to offer our dealers a portfolio of powertrains to give our customers a variety of options. We have the internal combustion engine; we have hybrids, plug-in hybrids and all-electric. And, yes, we are redeploying capital and increasing investment in electrification, and I'm even more excited about the strategic view that we've developed here. We're going to electrify our most popular nameplates like the F-150, Explorer, Mustang and Transit. We'll leverage hybrids to deliver fuel economy and performance, similar to the way we employed EcoBoost so successfully in the past decade. For example, we currently offer hybrids on three of our U.S. nameplates. And by 2022, we'll have \u2013 offer hybrids or plug-in hybrid powertrains or both on 12 nameplates. We're developing a suite of fully-electric vehicles that aspire to have an impact like other exceptional nameplates you associate with Ford. An example is the performance utility vehicle coming in 2020 that has received early reporting from the press, and yes, we will also offer fully-electric commercial vehicles. In fact, further on electrification, we'll leverage partnerships with Zotye and JMC in China and Mahindra in India to deliver affordable electric vehicles at scale. Well, as you know, our customers have an intimate trust in Ford Motor Company and we are confirming to them with all this kind of news that Ford is committed as a company to meet the Paris Accord for CO2 and we love the challenge of doing it in a way that excites them, helps them get their work done, while supporting strong returns for Ford. We are making real strides in autonomous vehicles and are in a far better competitive position than we were only a year ago. In August, we formed our standalone Autonomous Vehicles LLC. As expected and intended, we're receiving significant interest from potential partners and financial investors. And due to the trust our customers have in the Blue Oval, we are singularly focused on developing a profitable business model, gated by safety. Look for an event we have planned in Miami early next month to share much more about our self-driving system and business model innovation related to autonomy. And then with Mobility. When we refer to Mobility in our discussions, I want to be very clear : Mobility is all about wrapping software and services in new offerings to our customers. We already made a financial commitment to build our Transportation Mobility Cloud. This is an open platform through which Ford and its partners can deliver a myriad of products and services that will drive higher margins and recurring revenue streams that enable greater functionality and productivity for our customers. For example, yesterday, Ford Commercial Solutions announced a partnership with Avis to connect more than 35,000 Ford vehicles in the Avis fleet. These vehicles will allow Avis customers to manage their entire rental experience through the Avis mobile app. Additionally, these Ford vehicles will provide valuable telemetry data in real time, including odometer, fuel level and vehicle condition updates, allowing Avis fleet to quickly process information to prepare vehicles for customers. No longer will you have to report your fuel when you turn your car in. Now, having provided that overview, I want to emphasize that we've had an extremely productive quarter in terms of putting building blocks in place to support that strategy. Let me share some key highlights here. In the U.S., our product offensive started in earnest with the launch of the Edge and the Edge ST. And just this past Monday, Joe Hinrichs and I celebrated the start of production for the new Ranger pickup in the United States, which will be on sale early next year. This all-new Focus is off to a strong start in Europe. And in China, we introduced the Territory SUV, which will be key to reaching new customers in second-tier Chinese cities. In terms of autonomy, we just announced our second test city in the U.S., which is Washington D.C. And this will allow us to accelerate and build on the work we are already doing in Miami. I was also part of an announcement where we are teaming up with Uber and Lyft to support a concept called Shared Streets. This is a platform designed to leverage data to improve urban mobility. The datasets pledged by all three of us will provide the public and private sectors with new tools to reduce congestion and emissions, while improving the efficiency of city streets, making it easier and safer for everyone to get around. Let me add that our performance in China clearly has been disappointing. I can assure you the leadership of the company has swarmed the issue and we identified what is required for a turnaround plan. Importantly, you read yesterday that we named a new CEO of Ford China. I'm excited about the hire of Mr. Anning Chen, whose background, believe it or not, includes a stint at Ford more than a decade ago. Anning's appointment allows us to reorganize our AP region so that China is now a standalone business, reporting directly to Jim Farley to ensure that we improve speed, execution and local expertise. No doubt you've read about the fact that we've recently kicked off a redesign of our global salaried workforce. This is a new approach and it will improve costs. But that's only a secondary benefit. The sustainable fitness targets that I put out there \u2013 ensure that we recognize that our organization must be more agile, accountable, flatter and faster. This is important to the kind of company we're trying to become. This kind of fundamental change, especially in how we work and what we work on, cannot be solely designed from the executive suite and executed top down. The goals here are to flatten the organization and increase managers' span of control. We've already had success at Ford when we've given people this type of approach and the chance to redesign their teams and how they work. This isn't a new experiment. Quietly, the North American team, for example, has set up energy rooms where cross-functional teams focus on specific product opportunities. We're smiling because there's no private offices, no endless PowerPoint, no faceless emails and no long meetings. It's been a revelation to see how fast they have moved to improve the business, evidenced by the strong margins you're seeing that North American has delivered the past two quarters. And yes to the question, we are racing to replicate this globally over the next few months and we plan to provide an update on the efficiencies we're getting from this in future calls. The transformation I've just shared with you is but one of a fraction of what we as a team have imagined and we clearly are executing. For example, we previously told you that our marketing function needed an overhaul to become more fit, effective and modern, especially in terms of leveraging Big Data and technology. Well, we've taken action. Earlier this month, we announced key changes to bolster our in-house capability and we moved to a new agency model that will yield more creativity and substantial efficiencies. So we're addressing real issues. We are moving quickly to redesign the business in support of our stated strategy. With that progress, I know that you want to hear more about how we'll implement the $11 billion restructuring plan, which we highlighted in the second quarter, as well at that time, we talked about ongoing discussions with various strategic partners such as the one with VW and the partnership with Mahindra. These are big pieces of the picture that I'm trying to paint and we're fully committed to sharing detail as soon as we can. But I can't allow us to get ahead of the process. I assure you that the need to get our stakeholders up to speed is the priority for me and the entire company. But I've committed to you that we'll have several touch points with you in the coming weeks and months to give more specific detail of areas of important progress in AVs, the extensive fitness plans that we're now implementing and progress on our strategic partnerships. So before I turn it over to Bob, let me touch on our medium-term targets. There are adjustments here given the dynamics of the environment and I want you to pay close attention. We know that the underlying earnings power of the company is at least at an 8% EBIT margin or better with a high-teen return on invested capital. I mean, we know this because 150% of our EBIT is already coming from products generating mid-teen margins, with an ROIC above 40%. We've been transparent about this. In April, on a call like this, we said we believe we could hit an 8% EBIT margin and a high-teen ROIC by 2020. And at the time, that was assuming reasonable economic conditions. We also said that our improved fitness would drive a more resilient business model at all points of the cycle, which I want to confirm we continue to stand by. Well, the news today is that the current external environment has driven higher costs and uncertainty for the entire sector. And as we said last quarter, we had an unexpected deterioration in our business in both Europe and China. As a result of these factors, our current forecast shows we will not reach our EBIT margin and ROIC targets by 2020. However, I tell you as I told the board, we're not standing still. We're attacking everything that is in our control. We're working with urgency to re-design our business to operate more profitably. Our fitness initiatives are tracking as planned, our restructuring and strategic partnering initiatives are progressing and our reallocation of capital toward a winning portfolio of products and services is beginning to deliver results. Our progress on these fronts gives us even more confidence that we are building a more resilient and vibrant high-performing company capable over time of attaining EBIT margins of 8% or better, with an ROIC in the high teens. So at this point, I'll turn it over to Bob, and I'll be back to you in a moment to answer questions. Bob? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start my comments on slide 6, pointing out a few items from the company key metrics. So first, we reported mixed results on the top line, with company revenue higher than a year ago, driven by strong product mix in North America. Wholesale volume, on the other hand, was down 10%, and this was largely due to our joint ventures in China and Turkey. Market share also was lower. This was driven by lower share in China, although we had share declines across all regions. Company [Company EPS came in at $0.29] and this reflects an adjusted effective tax rate of about 11%. Finally, net income was $1 billion [down $600 million from a year ago]. Now to put the quarter into context against recent performance, you can see on slide 7 that revenue was lower than in the past three quarters due, mainly, to lower volume. Now, some of this is seasonal, reflecting the normal summer plant shutdowns that occur in Europe and North America. Company EBIT and EBIT margin were essentially flat from the second quarter despite the lower volume, and our positive company operating cash flow was substantially higher than the second quarter and a year ago. Now turning to slide 8, we see the absolute results for our company across our reporting elements. Company EBIT was driven by Auto and Ford Credit results, with losses as expected in Mobility and Corporate Other. The Mobility loss was split about equally between investments in mobility services and our Autonomous Vehicle business. The increased loss from a year ago also was driven about equally by higher investments in both those areas of our Mobility segment. The Corporate Other loss consists of costs for corporate governance, mark-to-market adjustments of marketable securities and interest income. The year-over-year increase in the loss was due to higher governance costs and unfavorable fair market valuation adjustments to our marketable securities. The details of our Automotive segment, which are shown on slide 9, highlight our performance in North America, where we generated a healthy EBIT of $2 billion, which is higher than a year ago despite lower volume and higher commodity costs. This was enabled by strongly positive mix, as our portfolio continues to shift more to trucks, utilities and vans. As a result, and as Jim mentioned, EBIT margin reached nearly 9%, which compares to an average first-half margin of 7.6%. While we continue to see a combined loss in our Auto operations outside North America, the loss slightly improved from the second quarter despite lower volume. This includes adjustments to dealer inventories in China that now have us positioned right where we want to be in terms of days supply. In South America, the ongoing recovery in Brazil slowed, due predominantly to external headwinds, including an 18% currency depreciation compared to a year ago and increasing inflation, including higher commodity prices. In Argentina, the peso lost 45% of its value compared to a year ago and annual inflation is running at 34%. Our team has responded with substantial price increases, resistance of inflation recovery by suppliers, and continued reduction in structural costs. We also continue to progress our plans to fundamentally transform our longer-term operating model in the region. Turning to Europe, we saw favorable market factors from a year ago related to new products, such as EcoSport, Fiesta and Transit Custom. Our Commercial business continue to be strong as well, delivering a record market share as Jim noted. EBIT, however, deteriorated from the year ago largely due to unfavorable external factors affecting performance in Turkey and Russia, combined with launch-related cost from the new Focus. Our team is focused on accelerating actions to improve our near-term performance, while we continue to put in place the plans to substantially to redesign our future business in Europe. In Asia Pacific, the markets outside China remained profitable although lower than a year ago, generating a 9% EBIT margin, as in the second quarter, the EBIT loss in Asia Pacific was driven by China reflecting the loss for consolidated China operations, as well as at our China joint ventures. The losses were driven by the same factors as in the prior quarter, which is lower volume and lower net pricing. Compared to our second quarter, however, we reduced the loss in China by over $100 million, or about 20%. We've made very good progress in addressing the underlying issues with more work to do. We're focused intensely on our sales turnaround plan for China and we're now just at the beginning of a strong product launch cadence, starting with the all-new Territory SUV, the all-new Focus and the new Escort. All of these models will make significant contributions to reinvigorating our sales growth in the first quarter next year. We also expect to benefit as we move forward from the added focus of transitioning China to a standalone business unit within Ford, led by a strong Chinese leader with deep local knowledge and proven, extensive operating experience. We also intend to strengthen over time our position in emerging markets, enabled in part by the creation of a business unit largely focused on how to win in these challenging and growing markets. Let's turn now to slide 10, Ford Credit key metrics. Ford Credit was an outstanding performer in the quarter, generating an EBT of $678 million, which was the best quarter in over seven years. This was driven by favorable volume and mix and favorable lease residuals. We saw our auction values rise 5% from prior year at constant mix and we now expect auction values for the full year to improve on average 3% at constant mix. We're very encouraged that U.S. consumer credit metrics remain healthy and in addition Ford Credit's balance sheet remains strong, with managed leverage remaining within the targeted range of 8 :1 to 9 :1. Slide 11 reminds us of the strength and stability of Ford's balance sheet, featuring cash and liquidity levels in excess of our targets, and global-funded pension plans that remain fully funded. Finally, we're reaffirming our guidance for full-year company-adjusted EPS of $1.30 to $1.50 per share. So in addition to what Jim and I covered in the call, we have provided supplemental material in the earnings deck with more details and insights on the business. So with that, what I'd like to do is to turn it back to the operator to start the Q&A. Operator : Our first question is from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good evening, guys. Jim, just in your comments and the way you're discussing everything, all the actions you're taking at the company, it kind of feels like the restructuring actions that you're talking about, $11 billion non-cash, $7 billion cash will be over a multiyear period and maybe more of a rolling process as opposed to what some of us in the industry are used to as sort of a big-bang outline of a plan and massive charters upfront. Is that possibly a correct characterization and we're going to learn about this along the way? Because $7 billion and $11 billion over a three-to-five-year period in the auto industry can get washed out in the total to some degree. I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about this, if this is more of an ongoing rolling program as opposed to a big-bang one. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, I think if I could have some license to think of the language a little differently, let me set this up for Bob, which is the way Bob and I think about this is I've come into the company trying to assess the design of the business kind of at an underlying level. Design for, as you know, John, reduced capital, higher margins, but there's other things, clock speed. We're talking about things moving faster. And when you think about that, I sit in your shoes and you say, hey, when will we know this? At what rate are you making these things happen? What I remind everybody of is we first have to find the areas that need the attention. We're through that. We then have to design the solutions for them. We're through a lot of that, but not all of it. And then we have to put them in place and perform. So if you read any hesitancy from me, it's not that we don't know where we're going or that we don't know how to do it, it's that it's a massive undertaking that we have to have very thoughtfully orchestrated. Because my experience in doing this is the worst thing we could do is disrupt our business and we aren't going to do that. So now, the accounting of it and things like that, I'm going to turn it to Bob and let him \u2013 give your opinion on that. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, I just want to supplement what Jim said. I think that's a perfect way of thinking about the way you expressed it, John. I'm very thankful for the question. When you think about the business and even if you look at the quarter, we have a strong North America, can be and should be stronger, but it's now gaining momentum. We have a strong Commercial business in Europe despite the loss that we had in the quarter. We talked about a big part of geography in terms of the market outside of China and Asia Pacific, a 9% margin. I didn't talk about MENA, but there we had I think a 7% or 8% margin. A small market, but it's 1.3 billion consumers and it is going to grow dramatically over the next 10 years and we're already starting to see the ability to be profitable there. So it's the rest of the business, right? And that business has got to be fundamentally redesigned. The restructuring is an output of that or a result of it. It's not a restructuring play, it's a redesign play. The result is the consequence of this restructuring and it will unfold. There will be, I presume, spikes. There'll be like a big thing that comes in this region at a certain point in time and then maybe it's a bit quiet for a while then something else big as we get to that next chapter of what's going to be an unfolding story. So I think that's a perfect way to think about it, which also I hope \u2013 I know it's frustrating, but I hope it helps investors understand why one can't sort of go to the last page of the book and look at the ending. It's got to sort of unfold. And that's \u2013 and we'll share everything with you as we can and as things are announced. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And, John, just to confirm too, you know that at the point where you're examining these kinds of options, if there was expedience options or more big bang ways of doing things, yeah, I was open to all kinds of ideas like that. That's what we've already plowed through. And so your understanding tonight should be just the way Bob and I are describing it. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just to be clear, the timeframe is around five years in sort of what you're thinking here as far as what you know right now? Is that about right? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, I mean, our business planning period is five years. There will be a lot that is completed in five years, but frankly, I think there'll be some elements that go on a bit beyond that. Let me just give you a good example. We may have made recent investments in new products that a normal cycle would be to run for five years. As long as those products are generating positive cash flow and sort of an incremental basis, we'll run them out. So we're not going to short cycle them at the expense of being able to demonstrate how strong we are in taking action. We want to generate cash. And so the consequences then of that running out and not redeploying capital in that particular location or plant or segment could result then in something that takes place outside the period. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And, John, it wouldn't be fair to say it takes a full five years, right? So part of the reason we're going to have a gathering where Joe Hinrichs takes you through a deeper understanding of the fitness actions is that you can see the range of things in terms of \u2013 some of them are, what I call, the now-near-far kind of clock. Some of them are now. Some of them are actually impacting now. I think we're trying to be really clear that North America, some of its results are from many of the fitness actions that we put in place a year ago. But you're also right that some are going to take longer because they're more complicated design challenges. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just a follow up on this. I mean, we're two years away from where you talking about hitting 8% EBIT and high teens return on invested capital. Obviously, market dynamics have changed dramatically more recently, so understandable. But just curious, what kind of market dynamics you need to hit those numbers? I mean, are we looking at sort of \u2013 is this sort of a mid-cycle thought process? I mean, just really trying to understand what you're thinking about there, because it is a big change. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: I think it's really more around timing. We had expected to hit those types of numbers in our five-year planning period. Back earlier in the year, we saw the opportunity to do that earlier through the impact of the fitness actions. But subsequent to that, we've seen more bad news on commodities, some related to policy, some not. We've seen issues on exchange. We've seen South America take another dip and so forth. So, there's \u2013 Turkey is another one, Russia. So, there are other issues. And then, frankly, what we saw happen in Europe and in China that was unrelated to externals, we expect and are addressing them very aggressively. But as you kind of flow that through to 2020, that could still have some sort of negative impact versus what we had expected back in April. Trust for that not to happen, but based on looking at the numbers today, that's where we are and we've just got to disclose what we see and that's where we are. But certainly, we're not backing off and we certainly see the ability to achieve the 8% margin and the mid-teen ROIC in the years ahead. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Those targets are still there. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yes. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And this is the tough kind of leadership question. We have to keep our foot on the throat of our performance, so we are doing that. All of us are really happy actually about the momentum we're building as we adjust that target. Isn't that ironic? But we think it's important as we get a better handle on our business that we share with you that we need to change the timeframe on that. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then just one last quick one on market dynamics. Net price in North America, negative $318 million, a little bit surprising to the downside. Obviously, mix is a huge, more than positive offset. Just curious what you're seeing in the dynamics in the North American market because some of the data we're getting externally is kind of positive and negative and it's kind of a little bit unclear to understand exactly what's going on there. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: I think that's a fair question. Let me give that to Jim Farley. James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: Certainly, in the utility and car markets, we're seeing more pressure because of availability, but it's really encouraging to see Ford's performance in full-size truck. Our transaction price is up more than the market. Our share is up. It's never been a more competitive segment. Ford's lead continues to grow. And we've had meaningful product investment, new diesel, Raptor is being well-received, new powertrains, so that all helped. I think the opportunity for us is, as we refresh those utilities next year, we really accelerate our opportunity for pricing and mix. These are high-volume products for us with enormous car parks and we're going off older vehicles to brand-new vehicles. I think we'll have the freshest utility lineup in the U.S. here pretty soon. So as far as the background market, I think it's \u2013 we're really in a bit of a different situation given the freshness of our products, so great opportunity for us. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Jim, that's the Escape and the Explorer next year, is that correct? James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: Among others. We actually have more Lincoln. We have quite a few and of course, we have 13 million pickup truck owners in the U.S. and we're about to launch a great new Ranger, which is a brand-new nameplate, so it's not just utilities, it's also pickup. John Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Thank you very much. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to follow on some of the longer-term planning and some of the market dynamics that you didn't anticipate that caused to take that down, have you similarly built in some contingencies around potential variation, your assumptions for the North America market or does that also assume that we remain roughly around the current levels? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks, Joe. I'm going to let Bob add to this, but in my text, remember I made reference to resiliency more than once. Because one of the things we hope to convince you of is that the design of the business has more resiliency in the downturn. So it's my expectation that you wouldn't be modeling that the way you used to. But Bob, how would you... Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, I guess from a couple of standpoints. Joe, one is, and this has been our view for quite a long period of time, is that we do expect industry to decline over the next number of years, I mean, still be strong absent a recession, but to decline in part due to affordability from all these increasing transaction prices and ultimately the effect of rising interest rates on monthly payments. We also have not assumed that there is any material change in the level of commodity prices that we're seeing, and that's hitting North America more than any other business unit. And that includes the bubble that we presently have in place that's a result of some of the policy decisions that have been made. So that's not assumed to back off. So all those could be opportunities if that weren't the case. And then of course we do normal modeling, both variable and central cases around other scenarios that affect each of our regions and as well as North America. So if there's something else that you had in mind, but that is sort of the present thinking around those assumptions. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : That's helpful. And then the second question is, not to get too semantic, but I think there's a lot of investor concerns and questions over this, on Slide 11 when you say committed to the regular dividend through the cycle, is that at current levels? Or just to continue to pay a dividend through the cycle? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: At current levels. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thank you. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: The regular dividend. Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Yes. Thanks. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: And we want to emphasize that we don't know how we've lost control of the way that's been projected, but we've been consistent saying that we plan to pay the regular dividend in this five-year plan. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Oh, great. Actually just to follow up on that, there's also questions about your credit rating. How important is it to maintain investment grade in your view? Because I imagine the dividends and all this cash restructuring, I think of many that are (41:04) getting downgraded, how critical is it? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, it's important. I mean, we have been there before, don't want to go back. But the impact is largely on, firstly, Ford Credit. We have to fund them to the tune of over $40 billion a year. And of course some of that is unsecured, some of it's securitized. So it impacts the size of the market that we have available for that funding and obviously the cost of it. Ultimately Ford Credit is going to pass that cost along to Automotive, so at the end of the day it sits in Automotive in terms of the impact. But it's important. I think it's an important thing. It's not around the balance sheet. It's not around the fact that we pay a dividend. It's around the operating performance of the business. It's very, very clear in talking with the rating agencies that even if we stop paying the dividend, that doesn't address the operating performance. So we're extremely focused, going back to what Jim talked about around the EBIT margin, return on invested capital, we are extremely focused on getting this business back on to a stronger operating performance track, because that is the issue that the rating agencies are expressing concern around. Obviously it relates to cash flow generation at the end of the day, but that is what we've got to focus on, is that issue. It's not a dividend issue; it's an operating performance issue. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And just to follow up on the question on the 2020 target, why not just push the targets out? I mean, there's no \u2013 unless I misread it, there's no new target date. But any color on why the decision not to just to actually put it back to where it originally was? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, we haven't \u2013 not done that, I mean we're just simply saying it's not going to be in 2020. Since we had put that marker out there and based on what's happened since then, we're compelled to share with you that we don't see, at the moment, a way to get there. So we're simply saying, not in 2020. But as I mentioned in my earlier comments, certainly we're trying to get there as soon as we can. But I'm not going to put a timeframe on it because I don't want to have to come back again and change it. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. And just lastly on China, any sense to when that stabilizes? And any idea when it gets back to a profit? How should we think of that inflection? Thanks. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Again, I'll turn this to Jim Farley, because Jim has been making a trip there almost every three weeks and you've heard about the news in the organization. I've been talking to the partner. While we've been fixing Ford's problems, there's a lot that's been going on in China. And Jim, you might share what you're seeing the last three months in China at large. James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: Sure. Well, first of all, this is such an important and urgent work by the team. The good news is we've addressed the error states we had, which is great. The stocks are down to 45 days. Dealers are profitable again and our sell-down units for these new products, the three that Bob mentioned were in fantastic shape. So we \u2013 I think we are in really good foundation for the launch of these new products that come basically, as Bob said, in the first quarter. And these are high volume products for us. Anning is a very experienced operations leader. And we feel that the accelerated costs, addressing the cost in the business is really essential for our profit turnaround in China. He has deep experience in purchasing, engineering and these are going to be keys to our turnaround in China for profit. The other one is profit line management, which has really yielded so much benefits here in North America. With these new launches, a launch mix in rates, series, feature content, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive better margins in China. So as far as the Ford team is concerned, this is all hands on deck, as Jim mentioned, and we are working urgently and as a team, as you can imagine. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Want to talk about industry sales? James D. Farley - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, industry, as you know in the third quarter was down about 10% in China. To be honest, that's a bit expected because the previous two years, there was a purchase incentive boost to the industry, which was eliminated this year. We saw a pretty big hangover in the first quarter. Industry demand came back, but it has not really recovered to last year's level in the third quarter. As Bob said, there's a lot of speculation about incentives or not. Look, our turnaround in China is really up to us. It's about our new products and our cost performance. But we definitely see a weaker market there. Some of it is external. Some of it is internal, like the purchase tax I mentioned. But for us, the opportunity is within our control. Colin Langan - UBS Securities LLC : Got it. All right. Thank you very much. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, Colin. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Great. Thanks for taking my question. Thanks for the earlier color in China, too, but wanted to ask on Lincoln in China specifically and on branding more generally. Relative to these tariffs that you're having to pay 40% now, where are you in terms of the localization of Lincoln in China? Can that at all be accelerated? And then the more general branding question is, previously I think it was seen that Lincoln would benefit in China from being associated with like the limousines used historically by American presidents, et cetera, by its American branding. Just curious how you think American car brands are being perceived in China currently with some of the headlines this year. I see Chevrolet and Cadillac seem to be doing all right, so maybe there hasn't been too much change, but just wanted to check in to see if you're detecting anything at the margin. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Well, the good news is \u2013 great question \u2013 good news is we have not seen any sentiment change at the consumer level. In fact, Lincoln is up about 3% year over year for us, despite having to take pricing. So we see continued very strong demand. We watch the favorability of both the Ford and the Lincoln brand monthly and we have not seen any change in the favorability of the brand as of yet. And this is a very important question about localization of Lincoln. We haven't been specific about the model. But one of the keys to our profit improvement plan for China will be accelerating our localization. We've already announced a Ford-modeled Explorer as well as a Lincoln model and that's very key to our progress. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. That's good to hear. And then I thought I'd ask too on Europe and WLTP, what has been the impact to your position there? How are you positioned relative to the other automakers in regards to that transition? And then just more generally in Europe; on the last call ,you talked about how maybe there hadn't been as much of a profit improvement from some of the recent launches over there. Just wanted to follow up to see if that was still the case and what your current plan might be to improve the profit in Europe short of the better contribution margin from new models, et cetera. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Okay. Well, WLTP has been a really large effect in Europe. As you know, it's had a pretty big industry effect. The great news is that Ford planned this very thoughtfully. We had no capacity issues, very little in our transition to 6.2. We're already through that transition. So Joe's team did a fantastic job and we don't really see any hiccups in our business due to that. But I know it \u2013 obviously it has a big impact on the industry as a whole. We're seeing \u2013 we're kind of entering the second month of a hangover for the sell-down of 6.1, but we're through that now as a team. As far as Europe is concerned, Bob mentioned it, we have such a gem in our LCV business, continues to get stronger actually for us. Our share goes up. Even if the UK, our leading market is down, we continue to make more progress. The opportunity for us in Europe is twofold for our profit turnaround. The first is costs in every part of our business and the team is really \u2013 continues to accelerate that work and we're working with all of our stakeholders on that. The other one is addressing our mix deficit on our passenger cars. We just have been under-representing the utilities, as Jim said, globally, but especially in Europe. But that all changes as we launch a new generation of utilities in Europe and even add nameplates next year and beyond. So I think the mix effect and cost will be key. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then just very lastly, on mix in North America, looks like there's some very impressive gains there. Can you elaborate on the drivers? I think I heard SUVs. Anything else? Speak to the sustainability of that. And I just wanted to check too because the line item there is called mix/other. What the other bit might entail and its sustainability? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, it's almost nothing. It's almost all product mix. And about 60% of it is that we're selling \u2013 as a percent of our total sales, we're selling more F-Series, more Navigators, more Expeditions, more higher margin products. And about 40% is that we're selling less of cars, but also the Escape. And I think the Escape one is an interesting one. We're going to launch a new Escape next year. And Jim might want to comment on it. We're actually taking conscious actions, decisions to kind of pull back a bit on volume because we're trying, not trying, but we're protecting, if you will, residual values and protecting the nameplate brand as we prepare for the launch of the new one. So as a result, less of those, so it's benefited us to the tune of favorable mix overall. Do you want to comment on that? And it's a great example of like the work we're doing around the product rooms. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: We believe as the utility business in the U.S. becomes a lot more competitive, given all the nameplates have been launched, Bob said we really feel like there's two big bets for Ford. The first is differentiation, where we're going to expand the number of nameplates into more differentiated, like authentic off-roaders or really fantastic on-road urban crossovers. But the other one is to address our total cost of ownership. We feel that for models like Escape, for them to continue to be great profit opportunities for the company, the residual value, the fuel economy performance of the vehicle, these are critical metrics for this leadership team. And as Bob said, we are actually taking some short-term share decisions on Escape to protect the transition to the new vehicle as well as protect our residual value to minimize our variable marketing spend. And that's another reason why we've had this mix effect. Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Yeah, great. Got a couple of questions here. I think we'll start with 2018 guidance. You held the $1.30 to $1.50, but you brought your tax rate down from 13% to 10%. I think that implies a couple of hundred million dollars of EBIT where your guidance got lowered. It looks like that might just be South America instead of improving just being flat, but wondering if there's any other buckets that we should be looking at for that implied EBIT guidance reduction. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: We haven't adjusted our EBIT guidance reduction, our guidance. We had a guidance on EPS and that is still within the range of $1.30 to $1.50. We've not provided any guidance on EBIT. So it is incorrect to assume that there's a reduction. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Follow up on that later. Jim, on the fitness plans that you've outlined, it's about $25.5 billion (53:10), I know it's over a long period of time. But I'm just wondering how much, if any, has accrued to the bottom line so far in this quarter? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: You're asking the question of in the five-year plan, what has happened in one quarter? David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Well, I'm asking to see if there's been any traction with those cost savings initiatives dropping to the bottom line just yet? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, yeah, okay. I'm trying to get at how precise you want that to be. So this is where I guess I was a minute ago, David, that we're seeing definite benefits now in our business. We said these were back-end-loaded because of the description I gave you a moment ago when I was reminding you how these processes get identified, to be reengineered, to be put in place, to realize value, kind of those four steps. So more value comes in the future. But it is happening and I've cited for you in North America is where I'm seeing early benefits. There's a concept that we've called yield management, which is one of the 19 that we're seeing real-time benefits there. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: But nothing quantifiable? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, it's been \u2013 for the year it's several hundred million dollars. I wouldn't be more specific than that. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just lastly for me, since you've outlined the modular architectures, I'm curious how much CapEx has been already spent on that transition, how long that's been contemplated within the organization and if there's any incremental spend that needs to be done in order to get you there and transition the portfolio? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Again, David, I'm sorry, but let me see if I can reframe that. So you realize the refreshing \u2013 the freshening that we just have done that we're just launching, the \u2013 kind of the capital that we have spent there, tied to the new products is one thing. And then this concept of these architectures, all the new things that are coming after this most recent refreshing. And so we have, in the five-year plan, definite capital improvements. I think I mentioned that in the text. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: You did. I'm asking because other OEMs have discussed developing modular architectures and it's taken multiple years for them to get to that and deploy it. So the question really is how much of that has already been done or established and behind us versus going forward and needs to be spent while you're launching those products? James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, well, let me tag team with Joe here because, remember as part of his executive role, he helped put this new architecture in. Joe, what's your sense of...? Joseph R. Hinrichs - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, the way I would describe it is we're at the peak of our capital and we've acknowledged that in our previous discussions. We're going to see the benefits over the next several years as the new product programs that we're launching today get the full benefit of the architecture and module work. So you're accurate in saying \u2013 in thinking that we'll get more benefit as the years progress, but we are starting to see engineering savings in the near term. On a capital basis, the capital reuse work we're doing and with the module architecture work combined will save a significant amount of capital over the next several years. Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Yeah, the only thing I would add and Joe can tell me if I'm wrong \u2013 but I think, David, conceptually, some of these things were piloted with our C2 platform, which is the new platform that underpins the Focus, the new Escape that comes and so forth. So a lot of it was piloted on that. That's already starting to go into our plants. So I think the learnings from that have just been further developed. So unlike some competitors who had huge changeover costs associated with going to a different approach, we don't see that happening inside Ford. And in fact, as Joe mentioned, we expect to see efficiencies moving forward. Joseph R. Hinrichs - Ford Motor Co.: That's exactly right. We're timing it to the introduction of the new products. So we're doing this in a timely manner. But that product freshening that Jim Farley and Jim Hackett both talked about, it times nicely with the execution of all these initiatives. David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. That's helpful. Thank you very much, gentlemen. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thanks for the questions. Operator : And I believe we have time for one last question. Our next question is from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Good evening. Maybe just one more on the 2018 guidance for Bob. Is there any bias in terms of the range on the EPS or kind of the factors that would cause to be at the low versus the higher end of that? And then maybe just to confirm, do you expect Q4 to still have positive operating cash flow? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: So I'm not providing anything other than saying that we're very comfortable with the range that we've provided and expect the business to come in within that range at the end of the year. In terms of cash flow, I'm not providing any guidance on cash flow, other than for the full year, which should still be consistent with the guidance we've provided all throughout the year, which is positive, but down from last year. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. And then on North America, I mean, looks like if I back out some of the recent recalls and some of the issues in Q2, you're running comfortably above 9% and you talked about the product cycle you have coming in the next couple of years. I guess, what will prevent North America from running even above the 10% that you previously talked about in the next couple of years? Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.: Well, North America should. I mean, that's one of the things that Kumar and the team are working on with their Return to 10 initiatives. I mean, at this point in the cycle, it should. But if you think about the headwinds that Ford has around commodities, it's about $1.5 billion this year and the vast, vast majority of it sits in North America. So that alone is worth quite a bit of margin, if you will. So I think if anything, you've raised a point around some of the increases we've seen recently in warranty costs. You think about that, you think about the commodities, we're investing in EVs, which of course has an impact, we're not selling them yet, all those things and to see North America starting to pick up a pace in terms of its margin, it's 9% or near 9% in the quarter. It's very, very encouraging because they really should be operating at that type of 10%-plus level at this point in time. They understand that and that's what they're working to achieve. Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. That's very helpful. That's all I had. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you, Itay. Operator : That concludes the question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jim Hackett for closing remarks. James P. Hackett - Ford Motor Co.: Thank you very much. Just want to confirm quickly that we're moving with urgency to execute against this strategy. We are pleased with signs of our success. These are early signs, including strong results as we just talked about, with the EBIT margin in North America of almost 9%. We're very, very happy with the strong balance sheet with over $34 billion in liquidity and we're making great progress on the product portfolio, I can't emphasize that enough. The dealers last week with lots of applause supported that. The redesign of the business includes these strategic partnerships with VW and Mahindra. They're all on track. And finally, we look forward to sharing more about this global redesign of the company. We are going to be coming to you more frequently, including we're going to talk about these strategic partnerships in the near future. Thanks for your coverage and we look forward to our next call. Operator : This does conclude the Ford Motor Company Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-answer-session [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, Diedra. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Farley, President of Global Markets. Also joining us are Marcy Klevorn, President of Mobility; Joe Hinrichs, Executive President of Global Operations; and Brian Schaff, CFO of Ford Credit. Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our progress relative to the value creation framework. Bob will then review our quarter results in more detail and then Jim Farley will talk about the actions we are taking to improve our performance in China and Europe. After Jim's comments, we will open the call up for questions. Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks. Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussions include forward looking statements about our expectations for future performance. Actual results may differ from those stated. And the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Slide 47. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and operating cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume-weighted basis. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett. Jim Hackett : Thank you, Lynn, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. If you return to Slide 2, as we recap 2018 and look ahead to 2019, I would like to make a couple of points to start our discussion this evening. For Ford, 2018 will be known as the year between the business that wasn't designed right and the business that we know will win. Certainly, it was a challenging year and that we were hit by some headwinds outside of our control and frankly, poor performance in some parts of the business, which we have now taken action to address. Importantly through 2018, it was a year of progress where we laid the foundation for a much stronger, more resilient and more dynamic business. A business that we want to tell you can thrive now and in the future. So I am really optimistic as we enter 2019. We have a clear vision. We have a solid plan and we are in execution mode. We are fortifying and building on our strengths to start and taking decisive action to address underperforming parts of the business. Some that you know about, for example, where our decision last April to phase out sedans in the U.S. and our restructuring in Europe that we announced recently, and Jim Farley will touch on this later along with the action we are taking in China to restore profitable growth. We are reorganizing and resizing our global salaried workforce, and we are retooling product development to bring more unique customer focused product to market more efficiently. We are leveraging relationship where it makes sense to be more cost and capital efficiency since as our alliances with VW and Mahindra. Our work on AVs and mobility is advancing quickly. We are connecting every new Ford vehicle in the U.S. to the cloud. And soon these vehicles will talk to the world around them through the technology known as C-V2X. Through this, we will help usher in a new transportation system that reduces traffic congestion, accidents and improves CO2. Now, let's turn to Slide 3. I will cover our full financial metrics here. For the year, revenue grew 2%. We generated 7 billion in EBIT with a margin of 4.4% and we delivered $1.30 in EPS. Now led by North America, auto EBIT benefited from the largest improvement in market factors in seven years. This benefit was more than offset by commodity and currency headwinds and higher net product costs as we entered a major product refresh cycle. We also incurred higher warranty costs and the Ford specific challenges in China and Europe, again confirming that we are addressing all of those. Importantly in the face of all that, we generated $2.8 billion in company cash flow and we ended the year with $23.1 billion in cash and $34.2 billion in liquidity, both well above our targets. I'd ask you to turn to Slide 4, this is a strategic highlight slide. Now in every market, this team is focused on introducing a fresher, more targeted and appealing lineup that can compete and win in the marketplace. For example in the U.S. over the next 24 months, we are refreshing 75% of the lineup. In that, we're bolstering our stronger pickup in commercial vehicle, now at $72 billion global franchise with 14% EBIT margin. In 2018, our F-Series outsold the nearest competitor by the widest margin ever. And our transaction prices were about 2,000 above segment average. In the U.S., we recently started selling the New Ranger and early customer interest has been very strong. In Europe, we are expanding our profitable transit commercial vehicle franchise that includes new services and revenue streams in that strategy. Now given our brand strength and capability, we have the opportunity to create a similar stronghold in SUVs globally and we are moving quickly in this area. The New Explorer we revealed last week in Detroit at the Auto Show is but one in the series of world-class SUVs that we're bring to market. The Lincoln Aviator is another example. And I have to say, we've been really pleased to see the experts know how superior the Aviator is to other brands that it competes against. We also launched the all new Focus and Escort in China, and this is the first of many new products that China. Jim will hit on this area as well. In terms of advancing our propulsion strategy, we introduced the new Explorer Hybrid, the first of our next generation of advanced hybrids that provide no compromise blend of capability and efficiency. We will reveal a new fully electric utility later this year with if I say so my-self stunning design, performance and technology. And we confirm that we have started early work on an zero emissions version of F-150. In November, shifting to the press review of self driving technology, we demonstrate that how that technology will propel self-driving fleets in partnerships with cities and businesses to deliver people and goods in new ways with new business models. I was very happy with the reviews that that generated. As we build out our mobility business, note that we acquired the e-scooter company Spin, and this has delivered first mile and last mile mobility solutions. Lastly, the bottom line impacts of our fitness initiatives on operating leverage will continue in 2019. I get asked about this all the time. Let me tell you that from 2013 through 2017, our automotive structural cost increased by $1.7 billion per year on average. We've arrested this trend in 2018, we kept cost flat year-over-year and we expect our structural cost to be flat again in 2019. Before I turn it over to Bob, let me say in the coming months that of course you can expect us to share more specific initiatives related to the redesign of our global business, there is nothing more important than having to understand what's happening there. I want to confirm that plans are in place and that we are taking actions. These announcements though have to come in a coordinated way as we work respectfully and constructively with our stakeholders. Now, let me turn it over to Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Bob? Bob Shanks : Thanks Jim and good evening, everyone. Before going through the details, I would like to provide some context on the quarter and the year. And to keep it simple, I'll just focus on the full year. Although, my comments generally apply to both periods. First off let me reiterate what Jim said about our market factors. In a year no global growth and industry volume and a relatively light new product action as Ford, we delivered very strong market factors specifically strong mix and higher net pricing. We delivered 45% of this in the fourth quarter alone. It's probably fair to say that most folks didn't expect this from Ford given our products' refresh plan for the year. And you should note that in 2019, we have planned a more active year of significant product actions in growing segments. Secondly in 2018, we incurred headwinds of about $3.3 billion in four areas. These impacts are not indicative for the most part of the ongoing run rate of the business; the first roughly $750 million in tariff-related effects; the second $1.1 billion of increased commodity cost unrelated to tariff effects; the third, about $750 million of unfavorable exchange net of pricing were taken to partially recover some of this impact; and forth, about $775 million related to the Takata recalls announced last year in North America. Now this $3 billion impact we incurred a bit more than $1.9 billion in North America. North America's EBIT, however, declined year-over-year by only $450 million. This suggests to us that Kumar Galhotra and his team delivered strong improvements elsewhere in the business as they continue their aggressive work to return the region to a 10% margin. South America absorbed about $400 million of these headwinds, yet it delivered $75 million EBIT improvement from 2017. Again, this demonstrates to us that the efforts of Lyle Watters and his team to successfully push back against these adverse trends, not to mention other inflationary effects not counted in the $400 million, as they approach the fundamental redesign of the business in the region. The two regions that essentially drove the year-over-year decline in automotive and Company EBIT, both for the full year and in the fourth quarter, were Asia-Pacific, specifically China and Europe. Asia-Pacific declined about $400 million of the company headwind, yet delivered a much deeper decline in results from 2017, $1.8 billion in fact. In Europe, Europe absorbed about $600 million of the headwinds, yet saw a year-over-year decline of $765 million and that was with the strongest product refresh among all our regions in 2018. These results underscore the urgency we have in addressing Ford specific performance issues and executing fundamental redesigns of our business models in these regions to generate appropriate returns on future capital that we may allocate to them. Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't highlight both for the full year and the quarter the continued strong and stable results from Ford credit. So with that, let's turn to Slide 6, a summary of our company key metrics. There's three things I want to highlight here. First in the quarter, all key metrics were lower from a year ago with the exception of revenue, which benefited from strong mix in North America and higher net pricing across all regions except China. Performance in China and Europe drove the year-over-year decline in most of the other metrics. Second, company adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.30 per share and this includes an adjusted effective tax rate of negative 4%, driven by the favorable impact of U.S. tax planning and tax reform. Finally, company GAAP net income was negative $116 million. This includes adverse special items of $1.2 billion. Two major items drove this. First, we incurred a negative non-cash pretax mark to market adjustment for pension and OPEB plans and that totaled $877 million. This was due to adverse financial market conditions that occurred late in the year. The second with personnel separation charges of $262 million. Now, turning to Slide 8, the favorable result in automotives and Ford credit more than accounted for the company adjusted EBIT of $1.5 billion. This result was nearly $600 million lower than the year ago period, explained mainly by a lower automotive EBIT. In mobility, we incurred a loss as planned, driven by investments to develop our mobility services and autonomous technology business. Next, looking at taxes. While total company taxes were low in the quarter, this compares to a positive absolute total tax effect a year ago, resulting in a large unfavorable increase and the impact of taxes. This largely reflects the non repeat a favorable U.S. tax reform and tax planning effects a year ago. Slide 9 shows that North America generated $2 billion of the $1.1 billion automotives EBIT. Operations outside North America were individually and collectively at a loss, which increased from a year ago. China and Europe drove the increase and the combined loss outside of North America. Slide 10 highlights Ford credit. In the quarter, Ford credit delivered earnings before taxes of $663 million, up 9%. The full year EBT of $2.6 billion was the best in eight years. Ford credit continues to operate very well and support automotives effectively. U.S. consumer metrics remain healthy. As shown on Slide 11, we ended the year achieving positive company adjusted operating cash flow in the quarter and the full year. We also ended the year with a cash balance of about $23 billion with liquidity at more than $34 billion, both above our targets. Cash net of debt was $8.9 billion. Our global funded pension plans at year end continue to be fully funded taking together and de-risk. Turning to the full year for a moment, Slide 12 shows that automotive and Ford credit results more than accounted for company adjusted EBIT of $7 billion. Mobility and corporate other as expected were losses. Compared to a year ago, the lower automotive EBIT fully explains the decline in company EBIT. Bridging to our GAAP net income result, special items for the full year were driven by the fourth quarter pension and OPEB re-measurement adjustment and personnel separation across North and South America and Europe. Slide 13 focuses on the regional results of our full year automotives EBIT. Like the fourth quarter, North America more than explained the profitability while we incurred losses outside of North America. Compared to the prior year and like the fourth quarter, the decline in automotives EBIT was essentially due to China and Europe. Unlike in the fourth quarter, North America was down in the full year as well due to the headwinds that I mentioned earlier. Turning to our outlook for 2019, as shown on Slide 14, we see the potential for year-over-year improvement in key company metrics, including revenue, EBIT margin, ROIC, cash conversion and adjusted debt-to-EBITDA. This is based on what we control and the specific assumptions we've made for key external factors as we shared last week in Detroit at the Deutsche Bank conference. From a business unit perspective, we expect North America, China and Europe where results were lower in 2018 to lead the potential EBIT improvement. Drivers of this would be the favorable effects of new products, fitness initiatives as they gain greater traction and a turnaround at least in part of the major factors that led to our lower China performance in 2018. Offsetting these positive effects in part will be higher investments in mobility, both for our autonomous vehicle business and mobility services development, as well as lower though still strong earnings before taxes at Ford credit. This reflects lower volume and margin and higher operating costs. Now, before going to Q&A, Jim Farley is going to provide his insights on the actions that we're taking in China and Europe to improve our near-term performance in both regions. Jim? Jim Farley : Thank you, Bob and good evening. Let's turn to Slide 15. Before I dive into the actions we're taking in China and Europe, I would be remiss if I didn't put a finer point on the opportunity in North America this year, and our 10% EBIT margin target. Last year, North America delivered $2 billion in favorable market factors as was mentioned supported by positive mix and pricing from a largely carryover product line-up like F-series. And modest new product launches like the new Expedition, Edge and Navigator. This year, we're beginning our complete refresh of our North America line-up. As Jim mentioned, we're adding Ranger, which is off to a great start to our truck line-up; we have the new re-engineered rear wheel drive Explorer, America's all-time best selling SUV; we have brand-new and hybrid performance models of Explorer; we have a wonderful new three row aviator, which is a new name plate for Lincoln; and later in the year, we have the all-new Escape and Escape hybrid, which will be a new product in the largest U.S. segment in our industry; we even have at the end of the year another all-new Lincoln utility. So let's turn China. Obviously, China is the largest automotive market in the world and we think it could be twice the size of the U.S. by 2025. So getting our business back on track is essential, given our plan to grow both brands in China. Last year as we discussed you with you, we identified a number of operating shortfalls, including inadequate dealer profitability. We had access stock, especially of our high-volume C cars. And these deficits were exacerbated by the fact that we had not maintained a fresh line-up. In fact, all of our volume cars were in sell-down last year. Also, our structural costs were not aligned with our volume and we lacked a strong bench of local leadership. Well, we've been working tirelessly and urgently to address each of these issues with a focus to restoring profitable growth immediately. At the core is having an engaged and profitable dealer network. For example, by the end of last year, just about a third of our dealers are now profitable and we expect this positive trend to steadily increase this year with our line-up. Relative to inventories, in the fourth quarter, we reduced our aged inventories by roughly 60% quarter-over-quarter. And as we prepare to clear the decks for all new product line-up, this is critical. This includes as well the launch of the all-new Escape and Focus, both of which produced a double digit increase in transaction prices last quarter. These are really encouraging results. We're also, on top of these products, adding more than 10 new Ford and Lincoln product to China to our distribution network. We're also aggressively tackling costs in China. Simply by sourcing from true local Chinese supply base, we will cut our material costs and we are targeting significant reductions in structural costs for consolidated operations. Lastly, to ensure China receives the proper focus, we broken it out as a separate business unit according to me and we have local China talent and key management positions, such as Anning Chen, our new CEO, as well as new marketing and sales leads for both Ford and Lincoln. Let's turn it Europe. I've said in the past to deliver on our long-term target of 6% EBIT. We are now redesigning our European operations. The core of this is to leverage our profitable light commercial van and pickup business and aggressively attack cost and drive improved capital efficiencies. Earlier this month, January 10th, we announced our plan to achieve this, including much more targeted vehicle lineup with three customer centric business units. And most importantly, we're standing up a dedicated light commercial vehicle group with its own general manager. We're also addressing our cost structures head on. We've already begun the formal consultation process with our key union partners in Europe. And turning the core of our portfolio in Europe, last year marked our fifth consecutive year of growth in share in the light commercial vehicle business. And we plan to extend that lead as Europe's number one light commercial vehicle brand this year, including key product improvements on Ranger and Transit later this year. With passenger cars, we will reduce our lineup while focusing in higher margin series mix, such as our new Fiesta and Focus ST and active derivatives. Now relative to profitability, we are prioritizing our higher-margin markets like Germany, and we will improve or exit unprofitable products and markets. In addition, we're also targeting significant reduction in personnel and structural cost. You're going to hear more about specifics this year after the consultation process is completed. Assuming a steady macroeconomic for our business units around the world, we believe all the actions I've just shared with you will drive favorable mix this year with fairly flat cost structure as investments in our all new utility products across the globe are offset by our specific cost actions. With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino : Jim, the way you communicated how you think about 2018 as a year and 2017 as a year of planning from a redesign perspective. If we were to fast forward to the end of 2019 and maybe into the middle of 2020, will 2019 be known as an action year for Ford? Jim Hackett : Unquestionably, David. And it's worth pointing this out that the time in I'm going to say in 2017 when we had our first investor conference to the beginning of 2018, we worked on the strategy. We addressed the product portfolio from stem to stern. You've just heard from Jim how important that was. We were constipated in product development. And when we did that, we updated the way we thought about car architectures and propulsion. So we addressed three big issues all at the same time, got our cycle plan in shape to taking costs out to boot. The second thing we did is we -- I was really pleased with the AV work with Argo. They really started at the same time in June 2017, so they've only been in real action in 20 months. So in that time that we are planning, we put a lot of work towards thinking about the evolution of the AV. I can just share that independently lots of people looking at this business and looking at all the competitors have rated Argo very high, not surprising given the talent that we have got there. And then we started tackle mobility. And you've heard me talking about David that the idea of building a cloud structure and connectivity, we had none of the vehicles really connected. Back when the call to action was being asked for. So we had to get that through product development and now the plan to monetize that. All those things are in shape. And then as a tour with you, if look at North America, its exemplary for me the way management team gathering to work and make all this stuff happened with Kumar has really gone very well. They ran into some headwinds that they frankly offset a lot of it and then some they couldn't. And then we had a footfall with warranty this year that Joe can explain more detail if that helps everyone understand that we've arrested we think a lot of the issues, and some of them were caused from the past that you just have to deal with. When I think about then in October '17 the call from very smart people following the industry, hey, what are going to do about these markets that are underperforming? Every one of them are being addressed. I also just want to confirm in China that I'm not happy with the way we performed there, but the lessons also showing the market moved on everybody and it's changed. So we just got to be world class dealing with that and you heard from Jim tonight and we can talk more about that what's going on in China. So that's my quick tour for you that from that thinking phase to the doing phase all those things I just said just from top of mind I'm not reading from a list, we're all over that. David Tamberrino : And my question is a little bit more around the restructuring side, if we think about Ford footprint today and Ford footprint, or what it's going to start to look like by the end of this year. Will there be -- you're expecting material changes, is what you are implying? Jim Hackett : Yes, so let's cover that. So on the white collar work, hard to explain but going very well is an attempt, I think it's a modern attempt, I said this at Deutsche Bank, to involve the leadership in architecting a new version of Ford that doesn't have as many levels and layers, less bureaucratic, more team oriented. We believe we will have that work behind us by April of this year. We started that last October. So it would've taken us five months. The Europe redesign is a little longer and we are going to start to seeing benefits later this year. You know and anyone who either follow industrial companies' paybacks in those parts of the world, because of strong social plans are four to five years on average but there is going to be some quick wins. And I think the confidence I can just cite this in our management team. We have a plan that\u2019s starting to come together. I'm very, very excited about that turning out very well. There is more news coming on South America. It's not a lack of planning or consideration it's managing the constituencies and all the different interests. But you don\u2019t have to wait long on that David, so you'll know more about the year there. The Russian alliance is under review. When I sat in the board room that that was done and we just did it again, and want to come back with given all these markets that Jim Farley had led to review of, we will be done with that. And you will expect then as you are looking at our forecast going forward it will clean, a lot of this will be behind us. Bob Shanks : David, another way of thinking about that will help you I think what you're trying to get at is that our EBIT charges that we talked about $11 billion effectively they're almost nearly spent by the time we get to the end of 2020. And when you think about the cash effects of $7 billion done largely by the time we get to the end of '21, because there is a little bit of a lag as there often is between the recognition of the charge and the cash going out the door. So you can read from that that we've accelerated the plans from what we shared with you earlier in the year. David Tamberrino : I think I would agree with that, thanks for the additional color, Bob. I guess my second question is really quarter related and go forward for China. Can you walk us through the headwinds for that JV income, which took another sequential step down to pretty seriously negative for 4Q '18? And how you think about the cadence to improvement if that's the level that we should probably start out in 1Q and as you launch new products and sell out that wholesales and dealer pipeline if that's going to turn around the business. Jim Hackett : I\u2019m going to ask Bob and Jim to tag team on that Bob. Bob Shanks : As with volume, we also had negative net pricing as that\u2019s been a feature in China for quite a number of years, but it was pretty simple and straightforward and the team actually delivered some cost improvements but not nearly enough to offset what we saw on volume. The volume was largely, I call it -- us also though as we all see in the fourth quarter in particular the industry really fell off very, very sharply. And Jim can maybe add to that. Jim Farley : So we certainly have line of sight for improvement narrowing our losses this year and as we localize several key models this year and next year and coming years, we see a great line of sight for very sellable profitable business in China. This year to give you a flavor, we have those more than 10 new products. Our dealer network as you mentioned is stabilized now and starting to grow in terms of profitability and engagement and a lot of those products coming in the second half of the year. I mentioned localization, those are really key, we have Explore, three new Lincoln's in three years. So the localizations really drive our profitability in next two years. Again, the teams have already started on very serious effort on material cost, as well as structural costs as well. We expect that to take hold in second half of this year and next year. David Tamberrino : Are there any type of legacy costs outside of employment contracts that would impede Ford from fully exiting any particular region? Jim Hackett : I would like to look at the riddle that there is a lot of variables in that consideration, and legacy cost would be one, David, but it's not the only thing that we thought about. Operator : And your next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : I just want to focus on one thing first on the big positive being mix and price. I mean in the industry has been more disciplined and I think it's been a bit better, particularly in North America as you highlighted. Just curious when we look at your aged products on a relative basis, what the key driver was that gave you just such significant strong pricing mix through 2018 in North America specifically and even in the fourth quarter? Is there stuff going on as [indiscernible] or other things there, what was the big driver there? Jim Hackett : I am going to ask Jim to address that. Jim Farley : So relatively speaking, the F-Series is carryover vehicle, but it's still relatively new. One of the big drivers was the impact of super duty in North America is really an important positive. And I would say as well the team is really laser focused on yield management. We've got a lot of really positive news on the controllables for series mix, product mix through different allocations, different go-to-market strategies. And those are being worked in these vehicle line rooms that we are now institutionalizing. But I would say a lot of it was truck, because that was still relatively new and is still and a lot of it was controllable by the team. John Murphy : Just a second question, I mean as we look at the cash flow in year, it was not the greatest this year. And then looking at the funding of the dividends, it was largely off the cash on the balance sheet. I think there is some concern in the rating agencies that if you don't get your plan workout and really try to cash flow around that your entity to pay the dividend off the balance sheet and then fund the restructuring from cash on the balance sheet. I mean from where you stand right now, the balance sheet looks like it's in great shape. So doesn\u2019t seem like there is really significant risk, but the rating agency seems to be getting little bit concerned about this. Just curious how fast you can get the cash flow turns so you can fund the restructuring of dividend out of operating cash flow as opposed to cash in the balance sheet and really solve the riddle for rating agencies? Jim Farley : Yes, that\u2019s getting a lot of attention, obviously. And I won't pretend to speak on behalf of rating agencies, but my interpretation of their concerns is that it's really operating performance. The balance sheet as you noted John is very strong, and we deliberately are running the cash and the liquidity at levels that are above our targets in part, because we saw this period of lower cash generation on the horizon and so we've been planning for that. But at the end of the day, what we as a team has to do is we've got to deliver stronger operating performance, and that operating performance include stronger cash flow. As we've mentioned, both at Deutsche Bank and today, we certainly see the opportunity for us to deliver on our plan this year and that include stronger cash generation. But again, it's an interesting -- it's not so binary. As I mentioned to someone the other day, if we didn't pay the dividend [ph] or we got $25 billion of cash. I mean, it's really a question, it's not that cash level it's the ability of the business to generate as we look ahead positive cash flow and we think that we're going to be able to do that to a degree that is above and beyond what we delivered in '18. Jim Hackett : And I might want to risk with you on this, Bob, because David Tamberrino question and John's question are linked here, because when Bob points the simple approach to saying you got to improve the operating performance to build confidence. David your question about all those things that we were doing is totally intended to do that. And that's why the team started with we got to get new product in the system. The new product has been observed it can do better, but we have to fund all the development of that that's in some of our higher costs. But we're happy that a lot of this is through the system and the new stuff is going to becoming. So it's the intersection of all that hard work giving us a chance now to win with all these things in front of us coordinated and happening now. So that's why I would give us higher probably of improving operating performance, because of the mix and the kinds of things that we're bringing to bear here. John Murphy : As you look at this and I mean you\u2019ve been in this job, and there has been some frustration of either the plan, and there is a lot going on in the industry on AVs and EVs and what's going on in China. As you look at the North Star of where you need to go going forward, is it ultimately really just product cadence that is 90% of the gain and the rest is 10%. And we just went through a pretty tough period for Ford on the product cadence notwithstanding the barrel leased in North America and China and some big stuff coming at it. So is it really -- I mean that's very complicated stuff. But I mean is it really that simple though? Jim Hackett : I get to look back towards the right with hindsight just like I feel I have to be studied that way. When I look in hindsight, I wouldn't have traded some of the product deferral that happens that cause some of the delays that we now are writing. So as I go forward, I have to look in the mirror and say I'm going to be faced with moments of truth, I'm not going to start product. So I do want to confirm what you said. But I think the challenges of competing in China and the challenges of competing in Europe, the challenges of competing in South America are also about design of business issues that we've addressed. They have to do with underlying car architectures. How complex the organizations can get, how big they can get, we don\u2019t have the F-Series profitability in all those markets. And in a way that might have mislead us about some of the potential. So it's the combination of product and what I would say a model design that we've addressed. Operator : And your next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : First, just a housekeeping item, I presume that the $700 million warranty item in the quarter was Takata and that the underlying North American performance excluding that was closer to 10%. Is that right? Jim Farley : The $700 million that I referred to was for the full year. There was a big chunk of it that was in the fourth quarter, but there was actually a couple recalls, there were some other costs associated with it that were spread through the year. So that was a full year. All those numbers I gave you Rod were all full year numbers. But it's true that that alone if you think about the revenues maybe 7/10 of a point of full-year margin in the case of just North America would have been up in the mid 8s. Rod Lache : Yes, but fourth quarter looks like you had a big number in it though on a year-over-year basis\u2026 Jim Farley : And just a chunk of that was Takata. Rod Lache : And just at a higher level, you're talking about an 8% margin presumably at some point beyond 2020. On your revenue base today that'd be $13 billion of EBIT. You are doing $10 billion in trucks and $3 billion in the Finco, so that kind of makes sense. But to get from here to there you need to improve by $5 billion or $6 billion. Obviously, people have been a bit frustrated by how long it takes to get some of these things together, the savings that you're working on. But I was hoping you can maybe flush out a little bit more on this on how we should be thinking about the cadence of improvement. So it sounds like the first thing that comes through is product, not so much cost savings. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about that and how that plays out in 2019, because it seems like there are some big products like Ranger that come out? And then as we look out to 2020, could those other elements, the savings and the exits from certain markets. Do those really start to move the needle materially in a year from now, or does that take longer? Jim Hackett : I want to help shape this question and tee this up for Bob, because no doubt you've heard me talk about the structural costs for five years kept accelerating, and we arrested that. And that didn't take us long and we have actually turned it down to the second year. The structural improvements that we are making in the white-collar area, the way I have described the car architecture and what that\u2019s going to do to product development is coupled with the inference that you make about once you get Europe restructured. Yes, you start to see a big improvement. And Bob, I know there's more to that that we are doing in addition to the things I just mentioned. But I want you to see that we are counting that as we talk to you. The frustration that I feel is felt is why is it take long to get that done and through the system. And I respect that. But it is what it takes to build an industrial model that we are talking about to do it the right way, not have it fall apart not to have big disruptions and so on. Jim Farley : Yes, so if you think about 2019, I mean clearly, we have got a lot that\u2019s going to be going on, on the top line, including mix, pricing, all the product stuff, building on very strong performance in that part of the business in 2018 actually. So that would be something that you should expect to see from us in 2019. Coming with that will be some degree of net product cost investment as always the case with new products. But we do have in the year a continued improvement in the level of fitness initiatives. We said when we first started talking about that that would gain traction little bit in '18 or start to grow in '19. That certainly is the case that that is included in our assumptions and then that continues to progress as we go forward, because a good portion of that was related to material cost that we believe it will realize as we go into new model. So that certainly is something that you will see featured as we go forward. But I think your overall premise about there been a put aside external things that could come against us. Yes, we should be accelerating as we come out of 2019, because we will have gone through a big step forward in Europe. There will be other parts of the business that we will have been taking actions on. There'll be more that comes in 2020. Going back to the comment that I made earlier around the acceleration of the redesign restructuring affecting some of our key regions, all of that should bear fruit. And then very importantly, the improvement in China, because we had a very large loss in 2018 we expect that to reduce in 2019 and we\u2019re moving very aggressively to get it back into profit. So that will really, really help. And don't forget the localization of some key imports into China which -- the effect of that is pretty amazing when you look at each of the Lincoln products and the Explorer in terms of going from what now are quite substantial losses for those imports to very attractive mostly business cases. So we have number of different things, Rod, that your overall premise of the business gaining traction, whether it's restructuring, redesign, fitness initiatives, localization, fixing things like in the case of China, all that starts to gain momentum as we move forward. Jim Hackett : And let me sneak in that something like a simple metric, we don't want to spend beyond our depreciation rates today and capital. So we got to wash through some things that were already in the systems but we're designing the business so that it capital appetite drops in the future. Operator : And your next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Ryan Brinkman : Firstly, following your autonomous vehicle demonstration in Miami during the quarter. I\u2019m curious where you think you are in terms of your autonomous capabilities, both in relation to your 2021 targeted commercial rollouts and relative to key competitors, such as Waymo or Cruise. Do think you are number one, number two, number three in autonomous, et cetera. And then Jim following on your comment in Detroit last week that you are open to investors in this area and have lots of interesting. I thought to ask what you would look for in a partner as it sounds like you might have some options. Jim Hackett : I mentioned in my comments that I\u2019m very proud of because of the interest in investors how our Argo has been graded. So it's a strong enterprise. You all saw that when it was down to Miami. And Marcy has worked really hard at this question of what partners make sense, how do we get one plus one equals three. I want to remark that you know last week we told that we signed an MOU to have discussions -- that\u2019s not coming from here, we\u2019re having somebody's phone that we started discussions with BW and nothing to report tonight. But Marcy, what else would you add to this effort. Marcy Klevorn : So first of all to answer the first part of your question about how we\u2019re feeling overall. Our message has not changed and our confidence level remains the same, which is we are on track to have a purpose built vehicle at scale by 2021. And we I think maybe somewhat uniquely have said all along it's a very difficult problem and we'll be riding in 2021. And we are also uniquely building the technology along with building a business. And as Jim referenced the Miami experience, we demonstrated how we are building the tech and the business side by side. It's very important. So when you see vehicles become available we have already figured out how we want to monetize them and establish key partnerships with Walmart whom we announced in November and already partnering with Postmates, Dominos and others. And as far as the partnership building on Jim's comment, we believe and I know many in the industry do as well as that there will probably be maybe 2, 3-ish kind of winners to us standing at the end of August, we are confident that we will be one of those. We will pick partners that help build that dominance and still building scale continuing to learn how to build businesses, et cetera would be something that we would look for in selecting a partner. Operator : And your last question comes from Adam Jonas with the Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : First to go back to the balance sheet and investment grade priorities that you communicated in Detroit. What is the higher priority, sustaining the current dividend or maintaining investment grade? James Farley : Adam, I think I was very clear at Deutsche Bank in terms of our overall financial strategy has starts with strong balance sheet and investment grade rating, maintaining our debt capacity and ensuing that our global funded pension plans stay funded and are de-risked. So to meet that is background zero. And then what you have to do and it goes to back to the earlier question that I think Dave asked, which is -- then the business has got to generate the cash flow that\u2019s enabled us to fund everything else. Everything else includes the traditional business, the new business opportunities, that includes obviously the shareholder distributions. So I think that that's the foundation and that's certainly how we're looking at the business and running the business. The dilemma that we're facing is the rating agencies are concerned about the operating performance of the business and the trend that we've been on, and we've had lot of discussions within about that in the plans that we have in place to address that. At least my interpretation again from chatting with them is it's not a concern around the balance sheet per se in fact it's opposite, they made the same comments that I think some of you have made around the strength of the balance sheet. It's really around this performance. So again repeating what I said in Detroit based on our view of what the year -- we expect the year to be, we would expect to generate a stronger level of cash flow. We expect to be able to fund all of our business needs, including the regular dividend but we have to prove that. Just having more cash isn\u2019t going to help we\u2019re going to have to -- we already have most numbers targeting. We have to demonstrate businesses turning on operating performance level, including cash generation. Jim Hackett : Adam, I just want to add, because we have had this conversation when we first met when you were thinking out loud with me when you are facing this buffet of issues that you have to deal with, and you are thinking about the cash question. I want you to think out loud with me how we've tried to hedge some of that in some of these alliance structures. In that it gives us pass to new product areas that we can share our cost and of course in the MOU and AV opportunity we can share cost in there. And none of those have really flowed through the planning yet, because they aren\u2019t all security yet but those are highly likely things that will improve hedging what you might see as a risk there. Operator : That concludes the Q&A. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jim Hackett for closing remarks. Jim Hackett : I feel like Adam didn\u2019t get to ask all his questions, I apologize for that. And we don't know what the noise is. So again, thank you for your tolerance of that, it's not coming from here. But I'd like to just say I think I feel good that we got most of our comments out. '18 was a year of progress in terms of laying the foundation for the global redesign of our business. It was all about sharpening the competitive so can better satisfy our customers while investing in the future. We aren't mortgaging that. Ford entered, this is my second point, Ford entered 2019 with a very clear vision and we're building momentum to improve profitability and returns. We're now in execution mode. Third, we're taking decisive actions in all underperforming parts of the business and we're allocating capital to higher return opportunities as you know what we did with the sedan issues this past year. In the coming months, you can expect us to share much more about specific initiatives in some of these areas that we're restructuring. Finally, the work we're doing today to create this healthy vibrant Ford for the benefit of all our stakeholders. And as I said earlier is going to allow us to invest in a future that will be even more rewarding than our mind for investors. We think this is a good time to invest in the ford. Our vision is to become the world's most trusted company, designing smart vehicles for smart world. And doing so, we have the opportunity to participate. This is an exciting thing and a new huge addressable market because of that. It helps create a better transportation and better world that will improve lives. Thank you all for joining us tonight. Operator : This concludes the Ford Motor Company fourth quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ford Motor Company First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] After the question-and-answer session, there will be closing remarks. At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, Ian. Welcome, everyone, to Ford Motor Company\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Jim Farley, President of Global Markets; Marcy Klevorn, President Mobility; Joe Hinrichs, President Global Operations; and Brian Schaaf, CFO of Ford Credit. Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our progress relative to our global redesign, and then comment briefly on the quarter. Bob will follow with a more detail look at our results. And then we\u2019ll turn to Q&A. Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks. Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure in the appendix of our earnings deck which can be found, along with the rest of our earnings materials, at shareholder.ford.com. Today\u2019s discussions includes forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance. Actual results may differ from those stated, and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on slide 40. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year, company EBIT, EPS and operating cash flow are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is on a volume-weighted basis. Now, let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hackett : Thank you, Lynn, and good evening to everyone. Before I begin the formal comments tonight, I want to extend a very warm welcome to Tim Stone who joined Ford Motor Company on April 15. Tim will assume the role of CFO on June 1, and we could not be more excited to have Tim join our team at such an important time in our transformation. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Bob Shanks. Bob has left an indelible mark on this company in his 40-plus-year career. As CFO, he's been relentless in driving for results and pushing the company to greater heights. He's also been a wonderful colleague, who's led with integrity. Now this part's off script. As great as a CFO that Bob has been for Ford Motor Company, this is an extremely wonderful human being. The world is a better place with Bob in it and my team has decided to just for a moment here give him a standing ovation. Bob Shanks : Cue a blushing face. Jim Hackett : Yes. By the way, you can see Bob's blushing. Okay. So let me turn to our results which we believe signal positive momentum for Ford. Our solid results this quarter, if you look at slide 2 and the recent strategic initiatives, demonstrate two things in our minds. First, we have a solid plan to create value in the near and long term. 2018 was a pivotal year for Ford, as we mapped out a fundamental redesign of our entire company. And this is required to ensure we could simultaneously strengthen our core business while making the necessary investments to be a successful player in the future. We know that the industry -- our industry is entering a period of profound disruption and reinvention. Second, we're taking action, moving decisively, and building momentum on this global redesign of our company. 2019 is a year of action as we target sustained improvement across key metrics including growth, profitability, cash flow, and returns on capital. Now, if you look at slide 3, which is titled 2019 A Year of Action, let me focus on some of the key enablers. Let's start with the winning portfolio. Across the world, we're fortifying our franchise strengths in trucks, commercial vehicles, and performance vehicles and bolstering our SUV franchise, executing the unique approach to electric vehicles that takes advantage of our strongest nameplates. And as you saw a year ago, we're phasing out vehicles that cannot grow and deliver the strong returns that are needed. And as you see -- as you will see when Bob reviews our results, these actions are already driving improved mix with higher average transaction prices and margins. If you look there at fitness, I've often referred to this as the state of our ability to compete. We are improving operating leverage, we're lowering our breakeven, and we have reallocated capital to higher return investments. For example, over our plan period, globally, we now expect to dedicate 91% of our capital to trucks, utilities, and crossovers. And we will achieve this while we also lower the capital intensity of the whole business. We expect these actions to drive higher operating cash flow and that will be led by Automotive. An essential part of Fitness for Ford is partnerships and to this end, we've advanced our alliances as you know both with VW and Mahindra. And yesterday, we were proud to announce a partnership with Rivian. Next, I want to focus on our global redesign. We are accelerating this. Our recent announcements in Western Europe, Russia, and South America, as well as the redesign of our global management structure show how we are rationalizing our cost structure, our portfolio, and footprint to ensure the company overall in each of our regions drive sustainable profitable growth. I want to touch on this a bit more in just a moment. Finally, as you look at the Smart Vehicles for a Smart World, we have the opportunity to help create a better transportation system that will improve lives. To this end, we made the decision to connect with modems virtually all of our new vehicles going forward and to leverage this connectivity to continuously improve our vehicles and services and create better experiences for our customers. We know this will build loyalty and deliver recurring revenue streams. Well, for your information, by the end of this year, 100% of new vehicles sold in the U.S. will be equipped with those modems and by 2020, 90% of our new vehicles globally will also be equipped with modems. So, in parallel, we're laying building blocks in the form of platforms to help us realize the vision then of a Smart Vehicles for a Smart World. Examples include Autonomic's Transportation Mobility Cloud or we nicknamed it the TMC. This is the world's leading automotive cloud. Earlier this week, we announced a global agreement with Amazon for our TMC to be powered by Amazon Web Services. This is great news because it expands the availability of cloud connectivity services and connected car application development services for the whole transportation industry. In addition, we launched FordPass Rewards. Now FordPass has been downloaded 6.4 million times and we now have 3.8 million members signed up. We do expect the growth of these members to accelerate. We also announced FordPass Pro. This is for our fleet vehicle customers. Returning to autonomous vehicles. We've selected a third city for business operations in commercial deployment and we expect to announce the location later this year. Also Argo AI, recently received a license to test AVs in California, making it the fifth state we're now testing in. If we can move you to slide 4 and you see announcements at the top. Here are some of the major initiatives, we've announced or taken so far this year. Our North American operation continues to move closer to its longer term EBIT margin of 10% with action to enhance effectiveness and reduce costs. The North American business will also benefit this year from a significant wave of product launches that includes some wonderful badges for us, Ranger, Super Duty, Explorer, and Escape as well as exciting new entries for Lincoln. In fact by the end of 2020, we will have replaced 75% of our current U.S. product lineup. We've also taken action to increase production of Expedition and Navigator in Kentucky for the second time to keep up with continued strong demand, so over 40% greater than what we had planned. We announced we're expanding the battery electric and AV capacity in Michigan. And we'll optimize costs by building the next generation Transit Connect for North America in Mexico instead of Spain. You can see the progress we're making in our first quarter results as North America drove a 2% increase in revenue despite lower industry sales and wholesale volume. And at the same time it achieved a 90 basis point increase in EBIT margin to 8.7%. In South America, we\u2019re moving to a more asset light business model. The team has made some significantly tough decisions. One was to exit heavy trucks and close our facility in S\u00e3o Bernardo. Through our collective approach and collaborative approach, we're working to minimize the near-term impact on all of our stakeholders. We're also beat now in the redesign of our European business as we have targeted a sustainably profitable business that delivers a 6% EBIT margin. Our future business there will be leaner, more focused and that will capitalize on profitable franchises strengths in commercial vehicles and utilities. We plan to significantly reduce our cost base there by discontinuing loss making product lines and adjusting our manufacturing footprint. For example, we've announced the closure of our Bordeaux France transmission plant. We announced the restructuring of our JV in Russia. We've offered separation programs in Germany and the U.K. and we confirmed we'll phase out two of these products the C-MAX and C-MAX Gran models later this year. If you look at slide 6, I want to just take you back to a decision we made a year ago when we announced our decision to phase out sedans in North America. Now remember, we want customers to understand the silhouettes that they prefer are the ones we're going to bring them. So in fact we don't intend to lose any of these customers long-term. But now in hindsight it was absolutely the right call. This slide underscores the benefit of thinking about a winning portfolio. We expect to drive over $1 billion improvement in annual profitability from our Michigan assembly plant once we fully ramp production for the Ranger and Bronco that are now being built there. Okay let's look at slide 7 and here I want to cover the financial highlights and before I turn it over to Bob let me touch on the quarter. We delivered good results and this is consistent with our view now that we will deliver better company results in 2019 than last year. Against the tough quarterly year-over-year comparison, the company-adjusted EBIT and margin increased despite a decline in wholesales and revenue, while we increased investments for future opportunities in Mobility. On an adjusted basis, we grew EBIT by 12% to $2.4 billion. Margin increased 90 basis points to 6.1% led by 8.7% EBIT margin that I mentioned in North America. We also delivered EPS of $0.44, which we're happy with the big beat there, but were also up year-over-year. These results clearly demonstrate the benefit of our fitness actions, the hard portfolio decisions and the aggressive business redesigns all of which are still very much underway and we expect more to be generated from all these actions. Lastly, we generated $1.9 billion in adjusted operating cash flow and ended the quarter above our cash and liquidity targets with $24.2 billion in cash and $35.2 billion in total liquidity. Needless to say, I and the team here are very encouraged by the strong start to the year. With that, let me turn this call over to Bob Shanks for his last quarterly review as Chief Financial Officer. Bob? Bob Shanks : Thanks, Jim, and good evening to everyone. I'd like to start with four key points : First the results this quarter are high quality and driven by the key specifics of the business; second while top line metrics were lower than a year ago, the company's revenue decline was driven largely by exchange as strong mix and higher net pricing about offset the lower volume. And even though market share was lower, we're growing share in trucks and commercial vehicles and expect improved performance in utility segments as we launch new and in some cases new-to-market entries over the next couple of years. Third, company-adjusted EBIT the best since the second quarter of 2017 improved despite external headwinds of about $0.5 billion versus a year ago. This includes lower industry volume continued those smaller increases and commodity costs including tariff-related effects; and adverse exchange. This $0.5 billion impact is net of pricing of about $100 million that we took in South America to partially recover the region's adverse inflationary and exchange affects. Fourth and most importantly, we saw progress in each of the three regions that drove the year-over-year decline in company EBIT China, Europe and North America and I'll touch on each one of them. First in China, we incurred a loss of $128 million on lower volume. This was an improvement from the $150 million we lost a year ago which was by far the best quarterly result in 2018. In fact, to put the current quarter into further context, last year in the second through fourth quarters, our average quarterly loss was $465 million. So the improvement in China from a year ago was driven by our consolidated operations offset partially by lower JV equity net income. The main elements of the consolidated improvement were strong cost performance and favorable exchange, although we also saw favorable mix and achieved flat year-over-year pricing in a negative industry pricing environment. The favorable currency effect essentially was a reversal of an equivalent adverse impact we incurred in China over the past couple of years. The lower JV equity net income was entirely due to lower volume. Importantly, we ended the quarter with dealer stocks in good shape and improving dealer profitability. While we have a lot of hard work ahead of us in China to return to sustained profitability we are encouraged by the early progress, Anning Chen and his team are making. So for the full year, we expect to build on the first quarter outcome and deliver a considerable improvement in profitability year-over-year although still a loss. In Europe, we were profitable but at lower level than last year more than explained by nearly $100 million of unfavorable exchange, most of which was a balance sheet effect. Within Europe's results we delivered strong EBIT and healthy returns for our growing CV and truck business. This was offset partially by losses on passenger cars, although the latter continue to generate positive current period operating cash flow. As you are aware, Europe's business redesign is underway and progressing well and we will have more to share with you as the year progresses. For the full year, we expect to deliver substantial improvement in profitability versus last year, driven by favorable mix, higher net pricing and lower cost. Turning to North America. We achieved our best EBIT since the second quarter of 2018 and as Jim mentioned a margin of 8.7% both improved from last year. The team achieved this through strong mix and higher net pricing aided by structural costs that were slightly lower than a year ago. From a product standpoint, North America's EBIT improvement was driven by our F-Series, despite new competitive challenges; Ranger as it came to market, and Transit America's best selling van. The region's EBIT also benefited substantially from the decision to exit traditional passenger sedans. The strong financial performance of F-Series was matched by robust performance in the marketplace. In the quarter and in the face of new competitive entries, F-Series customer sales and average transaction prices held strong from a year earlier while share of segment increased. And from here our plan is to strengthen our position further with the new Super Duty launching later this year, a new F-150 coming in 2020, followed by a BEV relatively soon thereafter. For the full year, we expect North America's EBIT and margin to improve from 2018. Now coming up from the regions to our automotive segment. We saw improved EBIT from a year ago. North America's performance flowed straight through to Automotive as the combined loss in regions outside North America was unchanged from the year earlier. However, this did represent a strong $630 million improvement from the fourth quarter. Within Automotive cost was flat year-over-year. So as a result, we generated strong operating leverage in the quarter, which drove a higher automotive EBIT margin. For the full year we expect automotive EBIT to improve, driven by gains in China, Europe and North America. Now moving to Financial Services, Ford Credit delivered very strong earnings before taxes in fact the highest in nearly nine years. All of Ford Credit's metrics were healthy including the continued focus on a lean, best in class operating cost structure. In the quarter, Ford Credit benefited from lower depreciation on vehicles in our leased portfolio and improvement in credit loss reserves, reflecting continued strength in consumer credit metrics. For the full year, we now expect EBT of Ford Credit to be about the same as in as in 2018. This includes a continued expectation for auction values to decline on average over the year by about 4% at constant mix. In our Mobility segment, we incurred an increased EBIT loss as we invested more as planned to buildout our capabilities to win in the future with mobility services as we leverage the connectivity of our products, while also progressing our developments in autonomy. For the full year, we expect a larger loss in Mobility as we increase our investment in mobility services and as our AV efforts move closer to commercialization with a bespoke product in late 2021. Turning to company-adjusted operating cash flow, in the first quarter, we generated $1.9 billion with the majority coming from the Automotive segment. As mentioned, cash and liquidity balances at quarter end were well above our target levels. And speaking of liquidity, earlier this week, we extended our $13.4 billion corporate revolver and we also closed on a new $3.5 billion supplemental credit facility further strengthening our liquidity and providing additional financial flexibility. Unlike our corporate revolver, the supplemental facility is intended to be utilized and includes a $2 billion revolver and a $1.5 billion delayed draw term loan. We expect to fully draw the term loan over the course of 2019, however, the impact of any draws will be leverage-neutral after taking into consideration debt reduction actions we took late last year including a repayment of about $1 billion of higher cost affiliate debt. Now, turning now to special items in the quarter, this represented an EBIT loss of nearly $600 million with negative cash effects of about $100 million. The vast majority of the charges in the quarter were associated with the redesigns of Europe and South America. As you'll recall last year, we identified about $11 billion in potential EBIT charges for our global redesign actions with negative cash effects of about $7 billion all through our plan period but primarily through 2021. This year we expect to incur $3 billion to $3.5 billion of the EBIT charges with negative cash effects of about $2.5 billion. We expect almost all of the EBIT charges to be treated as special items. Relative to our other costs and capital for the year, we continue to expect CapEx to be similar to last year, pension contributions to be about $650 million, and shareholder distributions to be about $2.6 billion. Now, before I turn it over for Q&A, just a few summary comments. Our first -- our view of the quarter is that it's a really good start to the year for the company. And while we expect our first quarter EBIT to be the strongest quarter of the year, that's due to seasonal factors and major product launches ahead, it does clearly put us on track to deliver better company results for the full year 2019. Due to our intense focus on improving fitness across the company, the work on our product portfolio, the redesigns of our business, and our disciplined approach to capital allocation, the business is now turning in a positive direction even as we continue to invest in future opportunities. We clearly have a lot of work ahead of us, but we have a solid plan and we're demonstrating the ability to effectively execute a heavy work statement, while concurrently delivering stronger business results. Our opportunity and our firm intention in the months and quarters ahead is to build on the momentum we're generating and ultimately deliver returns that are among the best in our business on a sustainable basis. Operator, we'd like to now turn it over to Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America. John Murphy : Good afternoon guys. Good evening I should say, actually it\u2019s been a long day. Bob, I just want to say, congratulations. It's been a long great career, and I only wish I had something in the slide deck to measure and give you a hard time about, but the results were really good. So congratulations. But you understand that. Jim is just a first question. As we look at sort of the discussion tonight in the slides, it seems like you're leaning back a little bit more on product being the core of the company sort of here in the near-term and in the long-term, a little bit more than you have in the past. And in the past you've been a little bit more focused on sort of the future tech and the opportunity. Is something kind of shifting in your thinking here really maybe it's an 80/20 shift or something like that, because it does seem like product really is king and you're starting to really grasp that a little bit more in the near-term and the long- term opportunities are a little bit more long-term? Jim Hackett : Thanks, John. No I don't think there's any shift at all. In fact if I take you back to this regime's arrival in June of 2017, one of the first things that we attacked was the product portfolio. In fact, this recent organization where Jim Farley and Joe take on respectively new roles, I've explained to the company that we weren't ready for this current organization back in June of 2017 because we had to get the product in shape. And Jim Farley and Joe and how they did an incredible job in very fast order getting that turned around. If you think about the essence of that like is it in competition with the future, it's not because as we're turning the product around, we're thinking about the design of smart vehicles for a smart world. What do they have to actually be capable of doing to enable the future things that we're seeing, including autonomy, connectivity and cloud-based interactions with cities? So, all three of these things are in our thinking. So what's nice is that the improvement in the product portfolio is fueling, of course, of the good news tonight, because that's what Ford stands for. And it didn't depreciate any of the investment or effort in the future tech that's all alive and well. John Murphy : Great. And then just a second question. I mean, price and mix were wildly constructive and positive in the quarter. But maybe if we focused on slide 25, and I don't know if this is for Joe or Farley. But you have a $1.259 billion positive on mix and price in the quarter, and we're still staring down the barrel of a lot of product coming out of. So I'm just wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail about what the key driver is there? Is it the F-Series? Is there something going on with fleet or and retail? Was there something really constructive maybe on the Super Duty side? Just a very big number and just trying to understand what's going on there? Jim Hackett : Yes, look, I'm going to hand that to Jim Farley. John. Jim Farley : Thanks, John. Look F-Series is an incredible franchise, John. We gained share. We finished the quarter at 41% share of the pickup truck business. That's a nine-tenths increase. We had built a leadership position over the number two player by almost 100,000 units in the quarter. Our average transaction price was just under $48,000 for F-Series, and we have the lowest incentive spend for any of the major trucks. And that was a big fitness exercise for us in terms of yield management. One of the big strengths to your point in the first quarter was commercial and government. We saw 11% growth for us in the first quarter much higher than the industry. The sectors that drove that were telecom and utilities. We saw daily order rates grow. The strength of Super Duty is really one of the key facets for the quarter. And obviously, we also launched Ranger. In fact with Ranger and F-Series together we had our best pickup truck quarter in 15 years. So look we have a lot to do, it's a very competitive market, but we have a great team. And we saw very strong demand for our product. And as Bob said, the product portfolios is chockful of new product. We have the new Super Duty coming later this year and an all-new F-Series next year. So we've got a great franchise for connectivity services and automation as well. There's a very strong quarter for our trucks. John Murphy : And maybe if I could sneak one last one in for Bob. There's been a lot of speculation about the potential downgrade at Moody's for your credit rating. But with what we've seen in this quarter, it seems like that may have been staved off. I'm just wondering if there's any kind of update in your perception as what's going on there or maybe any update on the metrics we should be focused on as really kind of turning the ship on that negative review right now? Bob Shanks : Yes, thanks John. Obviously, that would have to come from the rating agencies. But we talk with them a lot. We believe that we understand very clearly the areas of improvement they're looking for. And it is on the operating side of the business. As I said numerous times that it is not the balance sheet, its not distribution, it's on the operating side. So I believe that while this is just a quarter, the fact that we saw the improvement in North America, we saw an improvement in China. Although again, lots of work ahead. We got to a profit, which haven't been expected in Europe, because a lot of that redesign is still we get ahead of us in terms of the impact of that and portfolio changes as well. I think that we are hitting the parts of the business that they want to see improvement in not just a quarter, we got to do this quarter in quarter out. But I believe that's a nice step forward in terms of the things that they are concerned about. John Murphy : Great. Congrats again, Bob. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just give us the sense that there's been a lot of announcements through the year so far and restructuring actions. I mean, where are we in terms of what we should expect for the year? I mean, is there more -- is the -- go through the year is most of it kind of out there and we should start to see the benefits coming? How should we think about what else might be coming on the plan? Jim Hackett : Yes, Colin I just want to emphasize, because this is important in the trust that I build with you guys is we've been very consistent with what we've started with the fitness initiatives in terms of our target and where we are. So I'll let Bob fill in the blanks, but there's not a lot of shifts here from what we've been talking about. Bob Shanks : Yes, Colin, I think the way I would describe it is, while perhaps the areas where you'll be seeing impacts on the business from the actions that we take won't be new-new CEO for example we've talked about the redesign of Europe is underway, but we haven't given you much of the details behind that. Because we're in the process of the discussion with our social partners in terms of what that actually will be. We expect that to be completed sometimes around the middle of the year and then we'll start seeing more specifics. So you'll get more details. I wouldn't say that's more announcements. It's just more details of what we've already announced. We have talked about the fact that we're still chatting with VW and Mahindra about different opportunities. So there again nothing new in terms of areas, but potentially more in terms of what comes out of those discussions. Obviously that would be something ahead of us. So I think it's more about more clarity and more details. And the way that I would further put into context what's yet to come, is the commentary I provided on the special items. We only have about $500 million in this quarter of the $600 million, which relates to business redesign. And as I mentioned in my comments we expect to see $3 billion to $3.5 billion of charges for the full year. So you're going to have a lot more happen in terms of actions that are then from an accounting standpoint it's going to hit the books. And that's going to be second, third, and fourth quarter. Colin Langan : That's very helpful. How about South America? I think in your past presentations you showed that there's profitability there is very tough but not many product in that region and profitable. When you have the plant closure, have we seen any benefits from that in the quarter? And should we expect more actions considering the challenges in that region? Bob Shanks : Yes, I wouldn't necessarily assume that the announcement of the action on S\u00e3o Bernardo is the complete redesign of the region, because it's not. There's more and we'll announce things when it's appropriate to do so. You're not getting any effect of that action in the quarter other than the special items, because the plant is going to continue to run until towards the very end of the year. So there's no benefit today but we do expect to have a good benefit. I think we've indicated a payback of about two years from that action. So there will be more to come from the actions in South America. The thing to note there is Argentina has really been hit hard, with a very deep recession, extremely high inflation that's affecting the industry. We're pricing as much as we can but we're frankly not keeping up with the inflation, nor the effect on the exchange rate. So that's sort of a unique factor in the shorter-term that certainly affected the business. Over time our history tells us we recover those effects but in the shorter term a bit of a challenge. The thing to me that's positive is they basically held constant on a year-over-year basis without new product with the action in S\u00e3o Bernardo announced with all this going on in Argentina, but they continue to find good cost performance that enabled us to keep the business where it was and so that was a win from our standpoint. Colin Langan : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Bob Shanks : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Great, thanks for taking my questions. Looks like the faster than many expected improvement in China was really driven by cost and exchange rather than volume. But JVs on the British side I know are shown as a single bucket. But Bob you referenced volume being the main negative driver there. So, the question is really how to think about volume going forward for you in China? How should investors weigh? On the one hand a still very soft industry with on the other hand some pretty easy compares in the back half of the year. And now this new comment that dealer stocks are in good shape. So, are the product launches enough to allow you to grow in China even in the current environment? Bob Shanks : Let's -- Ryan let's turn that to Jim Farley. Jim Farley : Thanks for your question. Obviously we -- we're working really hard to stabilize our sales this year. We've launched a new product as you know and we've gotten very positive pricing. We do have opportunity for momentum in the second half of the year. But right now we're focused on stabilizing our sales. It's great to see the profitability improvement for the dealers and the stock. Stocks have come down, which is really a health measure for us. But right now we're looking at stabilizing our sales. Bob Shanks : Yes. I would if I could add to that the way that I would think about the business, Ryan is we're really focused a lot on the dealer profitability and the margins they're earning. So we're being very thoughtful and very careful in terms of that particular part of the business. So we're certainly not pushing and driving for volume. We're really focused on profitability and their engagement. So that's the number one priority. So as a result of that, I wouldn't expect to see significant if any volume improvement necessarily. This is really more trying to get the margins back particularly at dealer level and get the business stabilized on the locally produced front. The thing that's interesting that you see in the bridge is the consolidated part of the business has turned around very, very sharply and very quickly. And that includes the imports of the Ford brand those products as well as Lincoln in fact profitable, frankly in the quarter and a substantial improvement year-over-year. So that part of the business that we control and have our arms around, we're making faster progress. We have a lot more work and are really doing a ground-up on the JV side. Jim Hackett : Ryan, Jim Hackett here. I just -- I take my gaze a little further on the horizon with China as you might imagine. And the earlier question that John asked about product and was that a new leg under our stool, it's not. But I would admit that as we were rationalizing that product portfolio what became clear to me is that our position in China had ascended very quickly from where we started to where we hit at the peak was a function of we knew what the market was, but we lost track of that. And we lost track of it in a way that was going to take advantage of the things that John was asking you about. It seems like you guys are getting your act together on the product portfolio. So we're applying what we've learned about getting the portfolio in shape as we start to fix, China. So there's a longer term opportunity here that we've got to prove to you that this team that really I think understands product. And we've got a wonderful leadership team there. I just want to warrant to you that there's going to be better solutions in China for Ford than we're seeing right now. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. It\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And then just lastly for me, you've been warning about the sustainability of Ford Credit earnings for sometime now only to see the profit there just continue to inflect higher. You've been anticipating normalization in used car prices from some of the data we're able to track. I thought we started to see that in 1Q but you continued to record these big off-lease gains. Does the 1Q profit there cause you to think any differently about full year credit profit potential? Jim Hackett : Well, it did actually because in January, I think we indicated that we thought the results would be lower than 2019 and 2018 and today in my comments I indicated that we expect them to be about flat so that would be around $2.6 billion. We do not expect subsequent quarters to be at the level of performance in the first quarter. But if you -- I mean you've got last year's number, $2.6 billion we made $800 million. You can do the math it will be a very healthy second, third and fourth quarter but it will not be based on what we see today at the level of the first quarter. Ryan Brinkman : Great. Thanks. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Thanks. Hi, everybody. First I want to say congrats to Bob. And Tim, Bob has got the bar set a little higher for you. But don't worry stock -- auto stocks go up 8%, 10% after quarter results. That's a very normal, so just get used to it. So, first question is for Jim, are we at peak trucks? Jim Hackett : Are we at peak trucks? What's interesting, and Jim Farley, I know I think is the one you're after. Adam Jonas : Both Jim. Jim Hackett : Okay. Well, I don't think so, because we've -- in the face of some really good competition we're doing very well, Adam as you can tell. And Jim talked about where we are in the Series evolution right now, what we've been winning with versus what we're going to have. Jim Farley : Yes. As you know, we updated the F-Series a year or so ago, which was great. But we have really strong product coming. So that bodes well for our chances. For the market in first quarter, I think that the strength for Ford in commercial and government was a really important sign. We saw sectors including for the growth of Transit for package delivery, telecom, utilities, that really drove Super Duty F-Series and Transit sales in the U.S. double-digit growth year-over-year. So that's a really -- those customers as you know are really driven by cost of ownership. They're that very discerning customers. They want the best capability, but they also want the best efficient -- most efficient vehicle. And I think that bodes really well. The other thing to mention is that in the first quarter for us, Ranger, we only sold about 10,000. We're just still ramping up Ranger. And there was a very strong demand. I think our average turn is like 18 days now for Ranger, and that was incremental to our F-Series. So for us, we have a very new product cadence. We have more coming, and the strength of the commercial business is a good sign. Adam Jonas : Got it. Thank you for that. Second question is on the suppliers. If global auto production continues to let's say, flat-line deeper in the cycle and trucks don't provide as much incremental profit as they have up to now. How big of the opportunity for smart redesign intelligently contenting or rationalization of powertrain combinations that the consumer really doesn't care about or even noticed. That\u2019s extract some seriously better pricing or terms in your supply base who in large part are out-earning you and tell us all the time that OEMs are just going to keep increasing content all the time, and that they're just going to keep winning. Are they wrong? Is there an opportunity to you to kind of -- I don't want to say turn the table. That sounds too adversarial, but just saying 'Come on folks, pitch in here. We're going to simplify this and decomplexification can mean de-contenting.' How big of an opportunity is there for you? Thanks. Jim Hackett : Thanks, Adam. And you know I love the question, because like some of the comments tonight, this was one of the early things that we actually went after, which is in the fitness initiative. Joe Hinrichs, who\u2019s going to take this, and I have long talks about product complexity in how getting that right would start to be the gift that kept on giving. So Joe, you might talk about our efforts there and... Joe Hinrichs : Sure. Thanks Jim. Thanks for the question, Adam. I think certainly from our perspective one of the major fitness initiatives has been around capacity reduction, and we're continuing to see good progress there. And it's not just de-contenting, but putting the right content in the vehicles, especially as we think about to contemplate the new vehicles that we're designing for the future. I think what you're also seeing of course is the alliances and the partnerships that are taking place give us broader scale. When we partnered with Volkswagen on van programs, we have the opportunity to get together both for engineering savings, but also from a capacity utilization and supply base and ourselves improvement there as well. So you're seeing a number of these partnerships start to come around, which are also helpful with how we work with the supply base for scale. I wouldn't necessarily condition it like it's an adversarial relationship because there is an increase in technical componentry and content going into the vehicle because of all the capabilities that Jim's been referring to in the Smart Vehicles and Smart World. But rationalization of the powertrain portfolio is certainly a huge opportunity for all of us as we start this transition into electrification. So, this is the kind of areas I think you'll see progress alliances powertrain and also just leveraging the scale of the industry has to better utilize the supplier's capacity. Adam Jonas : Thanks everybody. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs. David Tamberrino : Great. Bob congratulations. First question as I think about the cadence of your net cost savings benefits you're achieving from Jim's fitness initiatives should we be really circling the structural cost improvement of $309 million in the quarter and the slide 23 walk? Or is there another level or a hidden layer of cost savings that you're already seeing achieved in the P&L? Bob Shanks : Yes, that's a good question. I mean obviously every quarter is a bit variable, but I think the important message from today if you take from the quarter that applies to the full year particularly on structural costs is that they're not going up. And that's probably inclusive of headwinds on a lower level of income from pension and OPEB. As you know that's been declining for some time, declining again this year several hundred million dollars. So, that's inclusive of that. And that's an important element because when you think about the contribution costs and material costs and we're making a lot of progress there for the earlier comments from Joe, there is an element of those increases that do come with the higher pricing and so forth. So, it's not just pure cost, it's costs that gives us the benefit. So, that structural cost capping if not slight reduction is going to make a huge difference in terms of our operating leverage which is what's driving the improvement in margin. David Tamberrino : Got it. As a second question curious as to what the company's plans are and what it has embedded within its long-term 6% margin guidance for Europe in terms of spend to meet the CO2 emissions that are tightening? Jim Hackett : Yes, thank you, David. This is something that we've talked a great deal about and I think I'm delighted with where Ford is relative to what's happened in Europe. I'll let Jim share more here. Jim Farley : Yes, great question. Obviously, earlier this month the European team shared our plans to expand electrification from mild hybrids all the way to full electrics and it's a really aggressive plan with 16 electric vehicles. One of the things that's just such a differentiator for us in Europe is our strength of commercial vehicles. And so although there are cost going in for electrification and CO2 compliance especially for 2025, we're in a really good shape to continue to nurture that commercial vehicle business which is really profitable and has more upside. For example in the first quarter, we gained almost half a share point in our commercial business. So, although there are more costs going in Europe as you say for the more stringent requirements in 2025 with the 15% reduction, we have the opportunity in the commercial side to continue to grow our profitability. David Tamberrino : Okay. But no quantification of how much you think that's going to put incremental costs in your vehicles for the region? Jim Hackett : No, not going to share that. David Tamberrino : Bob, if I may a comment on the press release attributed to you in regards to the seasonal earnings with 1Q being the strongest of the year. Can you elaborate on that a little bit further? I think a lot of the investors will have a question on that. Bob Shanks : Yes, I mean usually the first and second -- not every year, but the first or second quarter's usually the strongest of the year. In this particular year, we have a lot of launches that are taking place after the first quarter. And while coming out of the launch that's a lot of opportunity for us -- the launch itself because of lower volume launch expenses we start to amortize the investment and so forth. It is a bit of drag over a short period of time. So that's ahead of us. Also as you know in the third quarter, Europe shut-down its plants for four weeks so there's no production. North America does it for one or two weeks so you've got in general lower volume in the third quarter because of that impact as well. In the fourth quarter because of the end-of-year holiday and that 10 days or whatever we end up sort of draining the inventory that we have across the system and so therefore we have more labor and overhead the system inventory for most of the year and it kind of flows out and goes into the income statement in the fourth quarter. So that's a downward pressure there. So those types of things. We're still going to have good quarters coming forward. It's just we want to signal that you shouldn't think of the first as a run rate. It's a very good quarter. We've done better in the first quarter before. So no we need to restrain our enthusiasm, but we are extremely pleased with the start to the year because it gets us off to a good start in the year that's been a lot of heavy work ahead of us but it\u2019s a wonderful way to begin that journey. David Tamberrino : Appreciate all the colors. Thank you very much. Congratulations again, Bob. Bob Shanks : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Hello, everybody, and congrats Bob from us as well. Really enjoyed working with you over the years and I do wish you the best. I'm interested in just following up on some of the questions about China and the China plan. You had $160 million of structural cost reduction year-over-year in the quarter. And it seemed like a lot of the restructuring that you were pursuing actually started late in the quarter. There was a shift for example to Nanjing from Shanghai. Can you talk a little bit about what we should be expecting going forward? What the magnitude of the structural cost reduction could be to correspond with your plan? Jim Hackett : Yes, I just want to remind everybody that this is on the consolidated part of the business. So just to simplify what need to think about that's the net engineering. So that's the engineering we incurred net of the royalties we received as the vehicles are produced. It is the import business both Lincoln brand and Ford brand. It's the overhead of the team that's there in Shanghai. There's also a portion which is a component sales that we ship the components into the JVs and so that's a piece of it as well. So I'm just talking not about what's happening in the JVs which is where really the bulk of the business is in that portion of just described. And so what we've been focusing on is driving down costs as quickly as we can. We've seen less engineering, less manufacturing expense from -- this is also fitness right this is fitness of Ford on the imported vehicles that's now benefiting China those vehicles go over. Certainly our engine has been drifting out and addressing the size of the workforce in Shanghai. That's an opportunity more ahead of us than in the quarter but it has begun. So it's really broad-based it's not any one thing, it's across-the-board, but the results have been very encouraging in the first quarter. And I would expect as kind of look at the full year that that would be an important element of what will be the improvement of the loss that we had last year in China relative to what we delivered this year. Rod Lache : So just to clarify is this the run rate of year-over-year cost reduction or do you anticipate that it actually increases from here? Bob Shanks : I think it's pretty representative. It's going to be plus or minus. Rod Lache : Got you. And just broadly on strategy. Maybe this is a question for Farley. You're consolidating in almost every region to segments that have very strong brand equity. So in Europe, you're going to be mostly in commercial trucks in the Ranger South America presumably at some point a lot of it's going to be pickup trucks. And in North America, lot of what you guys are emphasizing now is brand \u2013 is products with very strong brand equity that's established. China is obviously very different. There seems like there are a lot of new products. It's expanding pretty widely. Obviously, it's a tough market. It's a fragmented market and you're a 2% player there. So, could you just maybe from a 30,000-foot view just help us understand what you want to be in this region? How broad you want to be and what kind of investment you're willing to put behind that? Jim Farley : Well, thanks for your question. First of all, we have \u2013 I just want to reiterate the ambitions we have to grow our utilities business globally. We have a great opportunity North America and in Europe with our utilities. For China, the story is a growth story. I mean, as shared last week with his 30-30 plan in the next three years we have 30 new products, a lot of those utilities you can expect Ford to really lean into the utility space. If you see the success, we've had in Territory, which is the new nameplate for us that's great. But we have the opportunity to localize a lot of utilities in China and also refresh the products that are at the very end of their life cycle. So you can expect China to be a growth story for Ford over the next several years as well as a lot of localization and a growth in our utility lineup. Rod Lache : Do you have a target market share or sort of size of the business that you'd like us to ultimately achieve? Jim Farley : Yes. Rod Lache : Could you share that? Jim Farley : No, I think it's best just \u2013 Rod just to leave it with our growth ambition. I mean, that's the most important. Rod Lache : Great. Okay. Thank you. Jim Hackett : Thank you, Rod. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Steven Hempel : Yes. Hi, team. This is Steven Hempel on for Brian Johnson. Just wanted to drill down a little bit further into the North American profit improvement here. Maybe just discuss, how to think about the sustainability of North American EBIT for the year and maybe discuss the quarterly cadence throughout. I suppose maybe a two-part question split-up between kind of cost including the launches. I understand, obviously launches are going to ramp up for the remainder of the year, but maybe discuss which quarters you expect to see the largest year-over-year headwind from those launch costs. And then secondarily, pricing which has been obviously key strong year-over-year tailwind now for the past two quarters maybe discuss that business and the key drivers of that North American pricing improvement in the quarter. Bucket it up, between F-Series yield management and any others as we might be missing. Bob Shanks : Yes. I guess, the way I would describe it is first of all, quarters are unpredictable to some extent. But I actually -- as I look ahead based on what we see now for North America, I think every quarter should be a pretty good quarter. There will be plus or minus us where we are this quarter, but I think every quarter looks good, strong. They are benefiting or being hit by the things I touched on earlier. But, in general, I think, strong performance by North America throughout the year. It will be feature costs that are relatively flat, in fact flat if you exclude the impact of the pension OPEB that I referenced earlier. The volume probably is not going to be as great, so that will be a headwind in parts, best the industry that\u2019s coming through. But in addition what you'll see that will drive the business will be favorable mix and you'll have very strong pricing throughout the year. And against that flat cost, it really just kind of flows right through to the bottom line. I would refresh everyone's memory. I think we talked about this at Deutsche Bank. There is a new contract this year. So with UAW so in the fourth quarter, in general, there's a large charge that we usually pick up once the ratification is achieved and that\u2019s probably to the tune of about $0.5 billion or so, and I mentioned that back in January. So that would be something that would be unique and one-time in the calendarization of the results in North America this year. Jim Hackett : And Steven, I got to slip this in because I don't know how close you've been to Ford. But the management team that's running North America is exceptional Kumar Galhotra was put in that job and we're just reviewing today kind of their serial quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter kind of improvements that they've generated. In fact, he from a method standpoint was one of the first parts of the world to build this new flat agile structure with these energy rooms. This is all serious commitment to moving faster and moving collegially across the company, reducing bureaucracy and it's been copied. And now I just add that the people leading the other parts of the world have similar kind of talent. So when Bob just talked to you about the way to think about the rest of the year, I was thinking about the guy running it and want to make sure you know how solid he is. Steven Hempel : Yes. That's definitely helpful. I guess switching gears here internally to South America profit. More so specifically the long-term outlook. It's basically saying that you payback for the currently restructuring this in place which basically roughly flat or breakeven which is clearly an improvement from where we're at today. But I guess, how do we think about the business long-term? It's -- move back in 2014 you mentioned long-term target of 7% to 9%. I'm not sure if that's really realistic anymore given you're exiting some of the businesses, but maybe this. And I guess is it more realistic to maybe think that Ford will actually exit South America completely and redeploy capital to higher margin businesses? Jim Hackett : Yes. I think where we are today is consistent message that I've said that we have the right or wrong design in these markets. And so, you're seeing us tackle, both in Europe and South America as examples that are now playing now. As Jim Farley has talked about the portfolio strategy there, we're working on a better design for South America. And that's -- there is more to come there, but these initiatives to get us in shape so that we have the right cost structure and all that, will be followed by really the right kind of things to win in those markets, with where we want to play with. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thanks. And I wanted to thank -- my congratulations, Bob. The first question is, just turning back to China. I think in the past something else you mentioned that was impacting, was the widening royalty. I think that was an impact in the back half last year. And also, some of the excessive structure in the Shanghai regional office. I was wondering if you could talk about how you think those two things trend as we move through 2019. Jim Hackett : Yes. We worked hard on both of those. Bob Shanks : Yes. The net engineering actually is still going to be a substantial drag on the business in an absolute sense, but it will be less so than what it was in 2018. Obviously, part of that very much dependent on the volume, because that is what drives the royalties. And you asked me about the central admin costs. Is that what you're asking me? Joseph Spak : Yes. Bob Shanks : Yes. We would expect to see improvement there, probably more second half weighted than first half, as Anning's working through the redesign of his organization. But yes, there will be an improvement in that that will contribute towards the year-over-year lessening of the loss this year. Joseph Spak : But that's still to come, that's not in the results we're seeing today? Bob Shanks : I would say its part -- I think, we've seen some improvement in the quarter. There's no question about that, but I think there's more opportunity ahead. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then, turning back just the question about CO2 compliance in Europe. I understand you're not going to sort of give us the cost. But maybe you could just help us understand \u2013 I mean, it's \u2013 I think it's a mass-based target. So maybe where are you or what is your actual target and where is the portfolio today? Jim Hackett : As you know, between now and 2025 or compared to 2021, the CO2 targets for our passenger cars and commercial cars are a bit different. And so I think by 2030 the current regulation is about a 30% improvement in \u2013 or reduction in CO2 for LCV and more for passenger cars. In the short term, obviously, we had the 6.2 emissions last year in the second half, which Ford really weathered very well. And between now and 2021 there's another new set of requirements which we're in a good position for, because of our new lineup. But the requirements in Europe really start to ramp up between 2021 and 2030 with the new regulations from the EU. Bob Shanks : So the parallel there, Joe \u2013 the parallel is that, it could have been better coincidence, which is at the time we're trying to figure out the redesign in Europe and the product portfolio going forward, we were aware of this kind of influence. So we've been addressing that all along in the strategy. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thank you. Good evening and Bob congrats. So I want to ask a high level question on North America. I think this is the third quarter in a row where you're growing EBIT with the declining SAAR. And clearly a lot of the investors with Ford start the analysis looking at the SAAR. When it seems like a lot of your profitability has been driven by the F-Series franchise and so forth, with the fundamental seem very, very different from SAAR and have for a long time. I guess the question is, as you think about how investors might appreciate results like this. What are the merits and the pros and cons to disclosing the F-Series franchise or the pickup truck franchise separately, to let investors see kind of what's the key drivers away from the SAAR itself? Jim Hackett : Well, we have the option of doing that. And in fact in a couple of the disclosures we've made over the last what a year or two, we've provided sort of segments and things of that sort of trucks or whatever high-performing products. So we're starting to show you more on the product line basis. I don't know where that will go frankly. As you know, one of the big changes in our organization has been to provide a much -- I call it the third leg of the stool of the lens of the business. We've got central. We've got scale teams regions. Now we're going to have a much stronger product line focused. That\u2019s our organization that Jim and Bob talked about at the conference last week or so. So I think -- and in my comments gave you a little bit more texture than what we have in the past. The improvement in North America was driven by the trucks. But I have to tell you also, the improvement was driven by the fact that decision we made around the passenger sedan. That was hundreds of millions of dollars or will be over the course of the year. So that's not immaterial, but it's something that we have the option of doing I suppose. It\u2019s not how we report the business, but we will be very thoughtful going forward Itay in terms of what we do with this information and form investors going forward, but clearly and I know your thesis and we don't disagree with that Ford Motor Company has a moat of trucks particularly F-Series, but not just F-Series. We're the biggest player in the world on vans, the Ranger we're number two or three, depends on how you cut it and that\u2019s without North American the mix and know we're going to combine forces to some extent with VW, is also a strong player. So more to come I guess on that. Itay Michaeli : That's really helpful Bob and then may be got my follow-up, may be for Jim on the expansion in the autonomous development to other cities. Love to get a little bit more color on decision behind that. And the reason I asked because some of the other competitors seem to be consolidating testing in like one particular city just to kind make sure that they are able to kind of conquer that city first. So love to go understanding of kind of decision to expand that I think you mentioned California testing as well and kind of what's gone into that as well as if you have any kind of updated size of the testing fleet over the next maybe year or so. Jim Hackett : Yes, I appreciate that Itay. I think, let me -- I'm going to ask Marcy Klevorn to help me with this because she and I just were in Pittsburgh two days ago for a full day reviewing with Jim Farley kind of our development there. I want to report it's -- what a great team we have in Argo AI and take you back to Miami. When we brought investors and media there, I think we got at large really thumbs up for experience -- intentional is the fact that we're testing in some really challenging areas. I mean I don't want to pick on any competitor because it's not my purpose, but you could put these vehicles in places where the weather never changes. There's not a lot of intense urban kind of challenges, mostly everyone's retired and the roads don\u2019t change a lot. I mean we've opted into some really difficult settings to prove this capability. So Miami's going really well in Washington D.C all of us on the call and the table have been in that city so you know the challenges. And in fact, the long-term viability of this capability is its ability to work in cities. And so that's why I think you're going to love the Ford position. Now to the direct part of your question in how we're picking cities and where we are going from here, I\u2019ll let Marcy fill in what the plans have been. Marcy Klevorn : That's a great question and as you say some are choosing to focus in a limited geographic location. And in that regard, it might be easier to wrap up pure like point A to point B miles. So we believe on Jim's comment is that complex miles are more important. And so we're picking cities as Jim side like Miami that are very complex to those at the Miami \u2013 they heard Senator Brandis's opening remarks, he said Miami was a black diamond city. It has so much going on in the city. And we embrace that and so those who participated or they read about it, saw that it was a Brandis that show that we could handle complex miles, different types of construction, different types of activity in the city, bilingual city and doing that well. So, now we\u2019re on to DC. We've got a third city selected for deployment, which we'll announce later this year, but continue to really build out complex miles. And in conjunction with that what we also did was we partner with businesses, so we've announced the likes of Chris Meno of Walmart. We\u2019re also partnering with local businesses to become a part of the fabric of the city. And that helps us learn how cities operate in urban settings, very important, it helps us learn how to monetize the autonomous vehicle in the future by working with local businesses and these big partnerships. And then finally it helps inform the SDS self-driving system software in addition. And that's really important, because over time as standard emerge and legislation takes place, pieces of that will have to be codified and those pieces in the SDS will become a commodity like happens over time in technology. And so because we're learning these complex situations, because we're learning how we might monetize working with these businesses, we will be left with some IP that will help us set us apart. And then finally to build on Jim Hackett's idea around human centered design, it helps us really learn more about in these complex situations, how humans want to interact with the vehicle and helps us build those humans center used case into our thinking and into our assessment. Jim Hackett : Yes. We laughed that if autonomy was only destined for the L.A. freeways, you don't have to deal with dogs and baseballs running across them and no need to recognize that. And so the argument that you see in the press about how intense the LIDAR commitment has to be is a function of that.It's our intent to have these things perform really safely as I've said. Another interesting thing is that we've been intentional about the way we think about the external environment in the vehicle relating to each other. And I've been on record at the CES talk a year ago, describing how cities are going to be communicating back to the vehicles and vice-versa. We're experimenting with that and all these tests. So there's a lot more in terms of the system's evolution that I think is going to be wonderful to talk about as we get there. Marcy Klevorn : And to answer your second part of the question about how many vehicles, we'll have 100 on the road by the end of this year. Operator : That concludes the Q&A. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jim Hackett for closing remarks. Jim Hackett : Thank you. And before we close, again I want to welcome Tim. Bob, thank you for incredible service. I want to reinforce four key points. First, we have a solid plan to create value in the near and long-term. We believe we're gaining credibility with you that we're doing as we said. We also as we said this was a year of action and making these decisions, building momentum with the global redesign of the company as we target sustained improvement across key metrics. And we're mindful of growth, profitably, cash flow and returns as we do that. Third, our results this quarter clearly demonstrate the benefit of our fitness actions, portfolio decisions that we've labored over and the business redesigns. And we do want to assert that there's more to come there. And fourth, we want you to know that we really do believe we've delivered a solid quarter. It is not just one thing it's across the board. And we now believe we're on track to deliver better company results for this full year and recognize in parallel that we have a lot of work ahead of us. So thank you for joining the call tonight. Operator : This concludes the Ford Motor Company First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company\u2019s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] After the question-and-answer session, there will be closing remarks. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, Ian. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2019 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Joe Hinrichs, President, Automotive; Jim Farley, President, New Business, Technology and Strategy; and David McClelland CEO of Ford Credit. Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of quarter and our progress against our strategic initiatives. Tim will follow with a more detailed look at our results and then we'll turn to Q&A. Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks. Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found, along with the rest of our earnings materials, at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance. Actual results may differ from those stated, and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Slide 68. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Now let me turn the call over to Jim. James Hackett : Thank you, Lynn, and hello to everyone. As we meet today, we're a little past the midpoint of 2019, which we said would be a great year of execution for Ford. And I am pleased with the progress we're making toward creating a more dynamic, innovative and profitably growing business. And our second quarter result demonstrates the global redesign of Ford is driving positive shifts in our business. We are improving our fitness or our ability to compete and the trajectory of the company is improving in terms of growth, cash flow, and profitability. We are making tremendous progress in Europe, which I will expand on in a moment. We are also seeing discrete signs of stability in our business in China, even as the economy in vehicle market there under recent and persistent stress. At the same time, we are actively working on the design and launch of new products that will help us grow in this market. Now, additionally, the redesign and restructuring of our business in South America is on track as well. We view all of this progress with humility, and the reason is that it's been my experience that the compounding positive effects of getting so many aspects of our business in shape does take more time. Yet, at the same time, these disparate aspects build on each other, which allow us to reach our full potential as an outstanding business. I'll touch briefly on some other highlights from the quarter. In Automotive, we delivered a 19% increase in EBIT, supported by a broad-based improvement in market factors led by North America, Europe and China. We achieved these results even with the natural drag on profitability in North America from ramping three very important product launches in the quarter. Our all-new Explorer and Police Interceptor Utility, as well as our new-to-market Lincoln Aviator. Now, if you recall, in Q1, we said our first quarter results would be the strongest of the year in part because of the magnitude and cadence of these future product launches, as well as normal seasonality. Importantly, we delivered positive adjusted free cash flow in the quarter, significantly better than last year, notwithstanding major launch headwinds. And on a year-to-date basis, we delivered $2.1 billion adjusted free cash flow, which is up 80%. In addition, our cash balance of $23 billion and total liquidity of $37 billion remained strong and well above our target levels. Our year-to-date results support our target to improve both free cash flow and profitability this year. Tim will go into more detail about our results and perspectives on the full-year in just a moment. Now, as we've discussed in the past, we're focused on four strategic areas for creating value. First is the winning portfolio, where we are fortifying our strengths, improving mix and expanding our commitment to electric vehicles. Second is fitness. It's our ability to compete, including advancing alliances, such as those with VW and Mahindra. Third is the acceleration of our global redesign, which was to ensure each of our regions in generating sustainable profitable growth and cash flow. And, fourth, is smart vehicles for a smart world. We are scaling products and businesses that connect to the world around them in ways that benefits our customers. Let me touch on a few highlights of each of these. We're now beginning to rollout our new portfolio, powered by the dramatic shifts in capital allocations of trucks, SUVs and performance vehicles, including the hybrid and all-electric offerings. This chart you see covers 2019 and 2020. We're expanding our lineup where the volume and profit is where the growth is and where the Ford brand excels. Of course, this includes pickups like the new F-150, Super Duty and new Ranger; commercial vans like the new two-tonne Transit and SUVs such as the new Explorer, Escape, Territory and Puma; rugged off-road vehicles like the Raptor and upcoming Bronco; and our Mustang-inspired BEV, that's going to be an SUV. In fact, in North America, we're driving down the age of our passenger vehicle showroom by almost one-half, as we replace 75% of our products by 2020. Over time, the new models we're adding for customers will more than make up for any share and volume loss by the phase out of sedans, while simultaneously improving profitability and returns. It's no small feat to deliver this many new products in such a short timeframe. Unfortunate, that I have a seasoned automotive veteran in Joe Hinrichs at the helm of our automotive division. When you witness the extend of the work that was done, much of it like clockwork, we will complete our assignment to successfully launch these products. For example, the transformation of our Chicago plant to launch the Explorer, the Police Interceptor and the new Lincoln Aviator was in some ways a bigger endeavor than the 2014 overhaul of our truck plants in Dearborn and Kansas City for our aluminum bodied F-150. In fact, the Explorer launch is arguably our most complex one over the next 18 months, combining an all new high volume platform along with what is effectively a new factory and a new body shop. We also launched our broadest ever Explorer line up with both hybrid and ST performance models, and we're introducing a plug-in hybrid version of that Aviator. Now, to achieve all this, we installed hundreds of robots, new technologies and moved out the scrap metal equivalent of the weight of the Eiffel Tower. I'm pleased to say that the demand for this new products \u2013 these two new products is strong. We are selling these vehicles as fast as we can build them. In fact, we are now expanding our capacity in Chicago. So, when you have a moment, do me a favor and click on the link on this page to watch a short video summarizing what it took to get our plant in Chicago ready for these key launches. I think you'll be positively impressed. Explorer, Police Interceptor and Aviator are just three examples of our dramatic shift in capital allocation to higher return trucks utilities and crossovers. At the same time, we are working to lower the capital intensity of our business. Of course, we remain highly committed to quality and customer satisfaction and everything we do. You can see that in the results from the most recent J.D. Power U.S. Initial Quality Study. For the first time ever, both Ford and Lincoln ranked among the top five auto brands in the US. I will expand a bit on our renaissance that is underway in Europe, where we made significant progress in the quarter. In early January, our team in Europe unveiled a comprehensive roadmap to improve or exit less profitable vehicle lines, address underperforming parts of the business, and improve profitability through efficiencies and a significant reduction in structural costs. In the first half of this year, our team did a tremendous job, achieving important milestones as they position the business in Europe for a 6% EBIT margin longer-term. These milestones include, number one, a new operating model and organization, including three customer-focused business groups, each with a dedicated management team and bottom line accountability. The first of the three groups is commercial vehicles, where we have reallocated resources to capitalize on our position as a top commercial vehicle brand in Europe, including leadership in the pickup segment. Now, over the next five years, we're targeting to double our profitability in commercial vehicles. The second group is passenger vehicles, which will focus on European built cars and SUVs. Third group, well, this is imports, a niche portfolio of iconic passenger vehicles, including the Mustang and Explorer. Importantly, we have largely concluded consultations with our social partners. And in the UK and Germany, we have carried out separations. In Russia, we have completed the restructuring of our JV there, which includes exiting passenger vehicles and Ford taking a minority stake and to improve manufacturing efficiencies we have proposed to confirm the closure or sale of six assembly and component manufacturing plants in Europe by the end of 2020. In the midst of this restructuring, we've also announced growth initiatives, including producing new all-electric vehicles and electrified options for all-new passenger vehicle models. These new vehicles will support our compliance with the new European CO2 regulations, which we expect to, achieve without having to buy credits or pay any kind of penalty. And our alliance with VW to support commercial vehicle and electric vehicle growth. Now, if I can get you to turn to Slide 8. Earlier, I mentioned the four strategic area that prepares Ford for this new era in our industry. I refer to this as smart vehicles for a smart world. Now this strategic area has benefited, as I expected, early from Jim Farley's mix of automotive and entrepreneurial history. He appropriately focused early on the conclusion of the negotiations with VW to broaden our collaboration. Now it's important to expand to you today why we're so enthusiastic about this news. At a time when industry consolidation is daily makings, we believe we found a more thoughtful approach to collaborating in key strategic areas without adding the complexity of cross-ownership. It started back in January, where Ford and VW announced a deal to develop commercial vans and medium-sized pickups for global markets. This collaboration remains on course and we're excited about the potential. Two weeks ago, VW CEO Herbert Diess and I said that our companies will expand this collaboration. Now, this included VW joining us within investment commitment to Argo AI. This is one of the most capable autonomous vehicle platform developers, as you know, based in Pittsburgh. The transaction with VW establishes an estimated value for Argo of more than $7 billion. Collectively, we believe we're on a path to create one of the most important autonomous vehicle platforms in the industry. Here's how our companies will work together going forward on autonomous. First, we will collaborate with Argo on the self-driving system, known as the SDS. That means that Ford and VW will be able to reduce our respective investments and development costs for the future AV businesses. We will be able to co-create common AV standards, both now and in the future, and we'll share valuable data with Argo to help build the best visioning and mapping models along with data utilization analysis for traffic and fleet management. Second, we'll share cost and expertise, so that we can each design and engineer unique, safe and efficient self-driving vehicles. Third, Ford and VW, of course, will remain vigorous competitors and pursue independent go-to-market strategies using this common Argo SDS platform with each of us designing and delivering unique experiences for our customers. In addition to our collaboration autonomy, we also announced we are extending our alliance to electric vehicles. Ford will become the first additional automaker to use VW's MEB, electric vehicle architecture. We'll leverage this architecture for high volume zero emissions passenger vehicle in Europe and this is designed at our Ford Engineering Center in Cologne, Germany. Ford of Europe will start building this vehicle in Ford facilities in 2023. We're also considering a second electric model based on this MEB architecture for our Ford lineup in Europe. This more expensive strategic relationship between Ford and VW is another important building block in the renaissance underway at Ford of Europe that I described earlier. But, with that good news, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Tim Stone. Tim? Tim Stone : Thanks, Jim. Hi, everyone. A few things to keep in mind as we discuss our results. First, both 2019 and 2020 are robust launch years for us as we bolster a winning portfolio for customers, reallocate capital to higher return growth opportunities and execute changeovers of our most profitable and highest volume vehicles. Second, our global redesign and fitness initiatives are progressing well, improving the trajectory of future growth, cash flow, profitability and returns on capital. Third, Ford Credit continues to deliver excellent results. And, fourth, relative to auto, we continue to expect strong execution this year, especially in North America, Europe and China. In the quarter, we generated $0.2 billion adjusted free cash flow, which was a significant improvement from last year. This performance includes the impact of our launches in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted free cash flow was up 80% to $2.1 billion, supported by improvement in working capital in auto. The ability to generate sustainable growth in free cash flow over time is our most important financial measure and we are on our way to achieving this. Wholesales declined 9%, driven by China, lower industry and the launch-related volume impact from North America, as it ramped Explorer and Police Interceptor. Interceptor, by the way, accounted for half of all police vehicle sales in the U.S. last year and the new models even more capable. Although wholesales were down, revenue was flat, as strong mix and pricing supported by our franchise strengths were offset by lower volumes and adverse exchange. Excluding the impact of exchange, revenue grew 3%. Auto posted a second consecutive quarter of EBIT growth, something we have not achieved in over three years. EBIT grew 19%, up from 16% last quarter, and EBIT margin expanded by 60 basis points. These results were supported by strong mix in North America, reflecting our franchise strengths and strong pricing in every region. In North America, EBIT declined 3%, driven by the changeover of Explorer, Interceptor and the introduction of Lincoln's all-new Aviator, as well as higher warranty. Our strategic investments in Mobility increased by 46% as we continue to build out our capabilities, including mobility services, connectivity and autonomy. Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter posting a 29% increase in earnings before taxes. Favorable loss metrics reflected healthy consumer credit conditions in auction values for off-lease vehicles performed slightly better than expectations. We now believe auction values will be down by about 3% on average for the year. Receivables were flat. They remain below our previously announced cap of $155 billion. Corporate other expense of $286 million included a mark-to-market loss of $181 million for our investment in Pivotal. On an adjusted basis, both company EBIT and margin for the quarter were flat at $1.7 billion and 4.3%, and EPS was $0.28. Excluding the Pivotal loss, adjusted EBIT would have been $1.8 billion, EBIT margin would have been 4.7%, and EPS would have been $0.32. In the quarter, we've recorded a $1.2 billion of special charges with cash effects of $0.2 billion. As expected, the vast majority of the charges in the quarter were associated with the redesigns of Europe and South America. This year, we continue to expect to incur $3 billion to $3.5 billion of EBIT charges with negative cash effects of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion, reflecting a shift of about $0.5 billion to $1 billion in cash effects to 2020. Lastly, we ended the quarter above our cash and liquidity targets with $23 billion in cash and $37 billion in total liquidity. Let me touch on the few areas of the business in more detail. In North America, as I mentioned, EBIT was down and margin contracted by 30 basis points to 7.1%. The region continued to deliver strong mix in net pricing supported by F-Series, as well as our decision to exit traditional sedans. This favorability was more than offset with the launch-related declines in volume and higher warranty. For additional perspective, wholesales for Explorer, Interceptor were down by 72,000 units year-over-year, which led the 7% overall decline in wholesales in the quarter. As Jim mentioned, demand for Explorer is strong with production already oversubscribed. Relative to wholesales, it's interesting to note that in the quarter sales of Ranger completely offset the decline from discontinued sedans. Last quarter, we showed you the benefit of this intentional shift in our portfolio using our Michigan assembly plant as an example. Once this plant completes the transition from sedans to Ranger and Bronco, EBIT was improved by over $1 billion. In the US, our SUVs posted a strong momentum in the quarter, including a 50% increase in Expedition and this month, based on healthy customer demand, we started to run additional capacity for Expedition in our Kentucky Truck Plant. By the end of this year, on a volume-weighted basis, we will have the freshest SUV lineup in the industry, led by our all-new Explorer and all-new Escape. Also, in the US, sales of total pickups accelerated in the quarter, marking our best overall pickup sales performance since 2004. SUVs continues to do well, maintaining market leadership with the lowest incentive spend at primary competitors and the highest transaction pricing. Ranger, which we launched at the end of 2018, more than doubled its volume sequentially, while also steadily increasing segment share to 14.2%. Europe delivered $53 million in EBIT in the quarter, an improvement of $126 million year-over-year, supported by our redesign actions. Favorable market factors aided by flat structural costs, excluding pension, drove the improvement in profitability. This is the first quarterly year-over-year improvement in profitability for Europe in two years. Commercial vehicles were once again a strength in the quarter, as Ford remained Europe's number one commercial vehicle brand. And, as noted in our product roadmap, we will be launching an updated two-tonne Transit in the second half of this year. In addition, Ford remain the market leader in the UK with Fiesta, Transit, Custom and Focus as a top three selling models. In China, consolidated revenue increased 48% year-over-year, driven by higher Lincoln volumes. EBIT loss narrowed to $155 million, an improvement of $328 million year-over-year, supported by improvements in consolidated operations in volume, mix and pricing, lower tariffs and structural costs, as well as favorable exchange. The team has taken action to stabilize sales with second quarter retail sales of 13% sequentially and aggressive reductions in inventory to improve dealer health. In fact, our dealer inventory is at its lowest level in the past 18 months and we manage the run out of Stage V effectively. In addition, China has implemented initiatives ranging from enhanced capabilities within in-depth Chinese market experience to strengthening cooperation with joint venture partners. Sales of our new Ford Territory SUV accelerated in the second quarter, making it the best-selling Ford SUV in China this year. Now, let me turn to our updated outlook for the year, which focuses on growth in cash flow and profitability. We continue to target an improvement in adjusted free cash flow year-over-year driven by Auto and we are now introducing a range for full-year adjusted EBIT of between $7 billion and $7.5 billion compared with $7 billion last year, representing up to 7% growth. These targets include continued strength in market factors and improved structural cost, excluding pension, led by North America, China and Europe, as well as launch-related impacts and strength in Credit. As a reminder, we expect to conclude our negotiations with the UAW in the fourth quarter. Assuming a full-year adjusted effective tax rate of between 18% and 20%, which would be up from 10% last year, we are introducing an adjusted EPS range of $1.20 to $1.35 compared with $1.30 last year. The tax headwind is worth roughly $0.12 to $0.16 in EPS for the year. Given the cadence of product launches and normal seasonality, we expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBIT to be higher than the third. Among other things, these targets are based on the current economic environment, including commodities, foreign exchange and tariffs. Relative to calls on capital for the year, we continue to expect CapEx to be similar to last year at roughly $7.7 billion, funded pension contributions to be about $650 million and shareholder distributions to be about $2.6 billion. A few final comments before we move to Q&A. 2019 and 2020 are robust product launch years for us, as we bolster our winning portfolio for customers, reallocate capital to higher return growth opportunities, and execute changeovers are our most profitable and highest volume vehicles. Our results this quarter and year-to-date demonstrate the trajectory of our business is meaningfully improving, supported by our product portfolio, global redesign, and fitness initiative. We have many opportunities across our business to drive free cash flow, long-term growth in revenue and profitability, including EBIT margins of 8% or better, and we continue to be committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings. Now, let's open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel? Emmanuel Rosner : Hi, good evening, everybody. James Hackett : Good evening. Emmanuel Rosner : So, my first question is about the second half guidance implied by your full-year guidance. At the midpoint, if I focus on the EBIT metric, it looks like your EBIT \u2013 you're guiding for an EBIT that would be down about $1 billion between the first half and the second half. And I was hoping you could maybe bucket this for us into what the main drivers are. It seems like you're flagging launches, in particular, but obviously the second quarter had quite a bit of that as well. So maybe just from a high level point of view, second half lower by $1 billion versus first half, what drives that? James Hackett : Emmanuel, thanks. It's Jim Hackett. As I hand \u2013 I'm going to hand this question to Tim, but I just want to tell the audience tonight that this is Tim's first call as our CFO and he has really done a great job of feathering into the Ford culture, bringing new perspective, new questions and he's become a great partner. When we sat in front of you in January, I remember thinking about how we were going to help the Street see our year and sitting in front of us, from my perspective, as a CEO, was an open question about the tariffs, Joe can talk about the back and forth there. We were working on our corporate redesign; this is the white-collar kind of effort that management reporting layers. We had restructuring that you were just starting to learn about in Europe and we were actively working on our own recovery of China. In fact, I just came back from there. So, from January to July, I just want to report to you, Emmanuel, as you look at those five issues, we've \u2013 I'm really happy with the way the company's tackled each one of them and the progress we've made. And you kind of teed up the good question in the right when I think about the second half of the year, which are these product launches. So, tonight, I want to make sure that you see that this a capability that we have to prove we're really good at. I have a lot of confidence that we are and you'll hear that we've tackled the toughest one first in Explorer and Aviator. But Tim maybe before Joe, if Joe wants to add color on the launches, you could just talk about the guidance and how we worked ourselves to that. Tim Stone : You bet. So, thanks for the question, Emmanuel. As you said, with the $4.1 billion in the books in the first half, the guidance range is $7 billion to $7.5 billion with growth up to 7% or $0.5 billion implies $2.9 billion to $3.5 billion, $3.4 billion, excuse me, in the second half. And as we said on the call is through these cadence of product launches and you can see in the materials, we distributed on Slide 5, the winning portfolio slide, we got a number of launches ahead of us through the remainder of this year and continue to ramp up on Explorer and Aviator. We have Corsair, Escape, Kuga, the two-tonne Transit, for example. And then normal seasonality as well. So, for example, in 2018, 56% of our profits came in the first half of the year and, as a reminder, again, we had \u2013 we have UAW negotiations concluded in this fourth quarter. So, we believe the guidance is appropriate based on what we're seeing in the business and including the risks and opportunities and that was appropriate to provide a range for the year. Joseph Hinrichs : Yes. So quickly, I'll add. We have Super Duty launch towards the end of the year, which is really important and the seasonality is real. We have the European shutdowns and we have the North American shutdowns in the summer months and then, of course, there are the holidays later in the year. So, there is the annual seasonality. So, it's launches, seasonality and UAW negotiations. Thanks. Emmanuel Rosner : Yes. And that's very helpful. And then just, sort of, as a follow-up. Would you be able to give us a sense, again, second half versus first half, how you think about it for your main regions, I assume that the bulk of the decline is North America, at least based on the launches that you highlighted. But is there any other region where you expect this to be the case and in particular in North America anything else besides sort of like the launches, that's a big bucket? James Hackett : Yes. Thanks. Thanks again. Some of the launches we've talked about are happening in Europe, for example, two-tonne Transit and Escape \u2013 and many of these launches around the world. But I just want to comment before we get too far down the path here that beyond the guidance that we've provided for the EBIT range, the EPS range, and most importantly free cash flow. We aren't going to be giving any further details on the inputs that go into the final output. So, for example, regional guidance or macro commentary or commodities or exchange to tariffs and so forth. So, recognize that to change. But we also changed by providing EPS guidance range and arrange for EBIT. So, I started coming on that in response to the question. Joe something else you wanted to add. Joseph Hinrichs : Well, obviously the bigger launches are North America and UAW leave it at that. Emmanuel Rosner : Great. James Hackett : Thanks Emmanuel. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you. Operator : And our next question is line of John Murphy from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. John. Aileen Smith : Good morning or good afternoon. This is Aileen Smith on for John. First question on the structural cost headwind in North America. Can you detail what these costs were specifically in the quarter and how you'd think about controlling or offsetting some of these going forward, particularly ahead of the UAW negotiations that you know and what could be labor cost inflation among other factors? James Hackett : Yes, one thing, Tim, can I sneak something in? Do you know John Murphy and I have something in common? I just had a brand new baby granddaughter and I guess John Just had a new baby girl. So, John, we want to send out a hooray for that in hope every mom and baby are doing well. So, I mean, let's go back to her. Tim Stone : That's great. Aileen Smith : Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Tim Stone : Congratulations. So, on the structural costs in North America, auto overall, it was go good auto overall so EBIT increased in 19% a year-over-year up from 60%. The first time and over three years or two consecutive quarters of a year-over-year growth and profit. And that's driven by structural costs. The commentary that I'd want to leave you with is structural costs are down ex-pension and OPEB overall. So as far as how that plays out for the rest of the year, again, that's factored into our, is one of the many inputs into our guidance. Aileen Smith : Okay. That's helpful. And then second question on the year-over-year China walk. As you think about the outlook for the rest of the year and particularly into 2020? Do you view positive contribution from volume mix, pricing costs and everything else is being sustainable, particularly in the face of a tough industry backdrop or one of these factors or others going to be a bigger driver of profitability improvement? Tim Stone : Yes. So, this is something that we want to kind of emphasize. We want to talk about color on China. So, Joe maybe you can feel that one. Joseph Hinrichs : Sure. Thanks. So clearly, we're glad to see the progress we saw in the first half of the year financially, especially on our consolidated results. Do you think about China in the last couple months? We have very aggressive sell down of the stage five emissions vehicles, especially in June. So, I think you start \u2013 I know you'll see some of the payback in the second half of the year, especially starting in July for some of that. So, we're watching what's happening in the industry there. Tim mentioned earlier that we were the lowest level of our dealer inventories in 18 months. So, we're feeling really good about where we are both with our stage five, stage six transition and dealer inventory overwhelmed and we're starting to see an improvement in dealer profitability. So, we're pleased with that. Our focus in territory products are building momentum. We still have a way to go, but they're building momentum and we have other products coming as Tim referred to especially escape it later in the year. Remember that year-over-year we'll have \u2013 we should we at this present state, we have lower tariffs than we had in the second half of 2018 because of the import duties going into China or 15%, which they were 40% in the second half of last year. So right now, that's the best positive year-over-year. I think we're all watching what's happening in the China industry I won't go too much into it because I think we're going to see how things settle down after the last couple months. So, the stage five, stage six transition, but we do expect some payback to that in the second half of the year. James Hackett : Thanks Joe. Aileen Smith : Great, that's very helpful. Thanks for the question. Operator : And our next question is from the line of David Tamberrino from Goldman Sachs. David? David Tamberrino : Yes. I've got to keep picking at this point on structural costs. It was a positive tailwind about $300 million in the first quarter. Now you've got a negative in the second quarter was negative in North America and negative in Europe. Really want to unpack that and understand what the positive was, ex-pension in OPEB, and if you expect it to be repeatable, do you expect to see that grow sequentially as we progressed through the year after you've taken restructuring actions? That is my first question. James Hackett : Tim, go ahead. Tim Stone : Yes. So again, as it relates to what's going to happen for the remainder of the year is factored into our guidance. I'll go back to the contract and structural costs, x pension of OPEB were flat, sorry, down in auto overall. So, what you're seeing there is us continue to execute on our fitness initiatives and the redesign and starting to see the early benefits from that in the overall EBIT results and in structural costs as well across the business. David Tamberrino : But you can't share the magnitude that it was down x pension OPEB and there was no incremental color on Europe taking a step backwards from the benefits you saw in 1Q? Tim Stone : No, not at this point. I mean if you look at the fact that we continue to announce additional redesign actions in Europe. For example, Bridgend and then we continue to execute on our redesign initiatives and as those play out, over time, you'll see the benefits flow through the P&L. David Tamberrino : Okay. So then asking that restructuring question, I guess you've made some announcements more recently, you finished the consultation process with your partners within Europe. When do you anticipate the ability to provide some color as to the potential cost savings that you should be seeing as a result of those actions? Tim Stone : Yes, the cost savings that we're expecting from the redesign and restructuring actions are factored in the guidance for 2019 and as we go forward and give guidance for 2020, you'll see that reflected there. But we're moving as swiftly as practical to execute on all of the redesign initiatives that we have in front of us. As we talked about, we have had $1.2 billion in the quarter, $1.7 billion year-to-date in charges. You still have a way to go. The 2019 outlook is for $3 billion to $3.5 billion and then similarly from a cash standpoint. But those redesigns and restructuring initiatives are also factored into the European long-term target of 6%. David Tamberrino : Okay. So, nothing to share today on the recent actions on annualized cost savings. Tim Stone : Not at this stage. James Hackett : David, this is Jim. I would just \u2013 again, in my tour, I just was there and it came away where Europe is performing in terms of this restructuring really well. We've actually been speeding it up. So, I want to make sure there's confidence that that work is happening and proceeding well. David Tamberrino : Okay. Thanks for that Jim. Thanks for taking our questions. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Rod? Rod Lache : Hi everybody. I wanted to just ask again about this just the regional performance. It doesn't sound like you want to talk too much about this with any specificity, but it seems logical that Europe and Asia improvements should continue your-over-year and what you're guiding to is a decline in North America related to launches. But can you help us frame this international improvement. There've been a number of announcements that you've made and you continue to work through this restructuring. How much of the cost improvement that you're looking at in China and in Europe? Are we already seeing reflected as a run rate in the Q2 numbers? And maybe at a high level, could you talk a little bit about what you still have ahead of you? Tim Stone : This is Tim. Let me start with what we've been seeing as you said. So, in Europe, we saw an improvement of $126 million in the quarter that's year-over-year. And that's the first year-over-year improvement we've seen in two years. That's the reflection of the redesign initiatives and it's focused on the customer, in commercial vehicles, passenger vehicle, and imports from portfolio standpoint. So, a positive $53 million profit in Europe and that's driven by the market factors and commercial vehicles and structural cost declines, extension. In China, again, loss of negative $155 million, but the EBIT improve to $328 million year-over-year. And that's compared with Q1 and momentum of $22 million improvement. So, going from $22 million to $328 million, and as Joe mentioned earlier, the dealer health is much improved. The best has been from an inventory perspective in 18 months. And China results are driven by Lincoln volume, the structural costs improvements, and a favorable exchange. So, pleased with what we're seeing in Europe and China. From a guidance perspective looking forward, we expect $7 billion to $7.5 billion and the EPS to be driven by \u2013 led by the North America, Europe and China, with structural costs and a market factors in the key drivers. Rod Lache : Okay. But there is some additional savings\u2026? Joseph Hinrichs : Rod, this is Joe. I just want to add \u2013 Rod, I kind of just add, jump in here just on the Europe piece specifically. There's been a significant number of announcements made this year and a lot of work by the team. A lot of that cost comes out over the preceding quarters, because we announced a 12,000 salary hourly agency positions that are going to be gone by the 20, but a number of those are still to happen. So that savings isn't in yet. And a lot of the plant restructurings, including some shift reduction, and other things that we have going on. It doesn't happen yet. So, I think you will see this play out over the next several quarters. Just to remind you though, as I said earlier, the third quarter in Europe typically the lowest quarter because of the shutdowns that we have in our plants. So, I just want to remind everybody that we're making very good progress on the structural costs in Europe, but we do have some seasonality to keep an even mind. Rod Lache : Okay. That's helpful. And just switching gears, my second question is just, if you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the market for full sized pickups, is from a volume perspective, things look fine from a share perspective, RAM is inching into the fleet market quite a bit, any kind of high level thoughts about what the prospects are for that market from your perspective? James Hackett : Yes, sure. Well, we're very proud of the first half performance in our F-Series trucks, strong mix as you noted, strong net pricing, and really for the first six months of the year, very pleased with the results. One thing we are seeing in the market is \u2013 the market will down a little bit in the first half a year on retail overall is up on commercial. And that's actually helping on the F-Series side where we're so strong. And you've just seen recent examples of how strong our truck products are in the marketplace. I mean, just today on the J.D. Power, a pure result came out and unprecedented event, we won all three trucks segments, Ranger, F-150, Super Duty won their segments and appeal. And that's against newer trucks, in the case of F-150. So, you can imagine how proud our team is of that. We have the lowest instead of spending the highest ADP as you know. This but our truck brands on F-Series continues to hold up very well and we're very pleased with our results and the trucks market itself was in terms have been growing. We're watching it very carefully. We were main competitive, but we also watch very carefully and maintain our discipline as we have always done. But actually, you're seeing our business hold up pretty nicely with all those considerations to take into account. Rod Lache : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam, your line is open. Adam Jonas : Everybody, good evening. First, my first question is on European CO2. I think I heard you right, you said that you're going to make the CO2 emission standards without buying any credits and paying any penalties. But my understanding is that those penalties start kicking in 2020 when you need to get to 95 grams and you're not going to have a BEV on sale. So, I just want to confirm, do you think you're going to get to 95 grams without BEVs? Joseph Hinrichs : Yes, Adam, this is Joe. Thanks for the question. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Joe. Joseph Hinrichs : Getting a lot of attention, so you're right. The regulations in Europe are not new to us. We've been planning for this really since 2013. And we have built the cost of this into our compliance into our business plans. We'll do it with electrification and improvements to our ICE powertrains. They're both important parts of the compliance plan. As we said, we don't anticipate incurring fines or purchasing credits, assuming consumer demands there for the new products. I wouldn't assume that we won't have a BEV in the marketplace. We said electrification and improvement to ICE powertrains are part of that. But we feel very confident in our compliance plans and we've been planning for this for quite some time. Adam Jonas : Okay. I mean, it's just a big statement. I think you're around 120, you get to 95 and maybe you can import some of the non-MEB, BEVs, but I imagine that would be pretty small volumes. So, it just stands out as we can take it offline. It stands out as a really big gap to cross in such short time that's more observation. James Hackett : Yes. I appreciate the challenge, but I want you to know we're planning to make it. Adam Jonas : Okay. The second question \u2013 thanks Jim. So, second question is maybe for \u2013 I don't know if Dave McClelland or Joe and you could take this on the Ford Credit side. If I asked you, obviously money and supply of money and availability of credits historically still pretty strong, maybe not as strong as it's ever been, but still in the strong category. I'm wondering if you see anything, have I push you anything that you're seeing incrementally that might be a yellow light or a flickering green light? In terms of credit quality at the margin or anything on the funding side or consumer behavior delinquency side at all? Obviously, there's some natural seasoning and cyclicality, but I just wanted to know if there's anything that you thought was a little somebody's taking a look closer look at? Thanks. Joseph Hinrichs : This is David. It sounds like he's asking about PD ratings of our customers and then what's the sources... David McClelland : Sure. So, Adam, this is David. Tim mentioned in his introduction that the current environment looked pretty healthy and if I think about your question and looks at our portfolio or look at the originations. The strength of what we're seeing coming through the door is still really strong or average vehicles nearly 750. And we're not seeing any change in the higher risk. A mix of business we're sitting at 5% that hasn't moved. In fact, generally subprime placements are lower quarter-over-quarter. There's no increase in term our average term 65 months and the industry 69. We're not seeing any growth in nearly four months. So, at origination, I don't see any flickering solid degree. And then if you look at the performance of the portfolio, the portfolio continues to perform well. In fact, quarter-over-quarter our loss ratios have improved 60-day delinquency is done, repossession rate is done. And then even if I look at our leases, we've seen better than expected performance at auction. We not at constant mix think that the used vehicle prices only be down 3%. So, as Tim said, it's healthy I think yes, to use your terminology it's solidly green. Adam Jonas : Great David. Thank you very much. James Hackett : Thanks Adam. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Colin Langan from UBS. Colin, your line is open. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just to start up, I mean, if you look at the guidance for global redesign costs, you're trending well below the full-year target, the outlook. Does that imply that there's still more major step coming through the year and given the size of these targets, does that mean something is going to be coming over the next few months? Any color there on how much more actions we should be expecting? James Hackett : Yes. It's Jim. Colin, so the way we're monitoring this is, we took on the structure, the management structure, what we called the bureaucracy. So, we had four key goals in that. I'll just report to everyone; we exceeded every one of them. And this quarter was heavier in terms of impact of the cost of that than the first. There were more implications with people. And then in the restructuring, Tim, I'll let you talk about the flows there. Tim Stone : Great. Thanks Jim. So, as I mentioned earlier, we had $1.2 billion in charges in the second quarter and then from a year-to-date standpoint, it's $1.7 billion in charges. And we're saying $3 billion to $3.5 billion for the full-year. So, it's certainly implies you have quite a way to go yet for the rest of the year. Further detail on that, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate this time if you haven't made the decision on the ideas that we have for further redesign. But that's against the total backdrop of $11 billion over the next several years, all of which will provide us with opportunity over time to fundamentally continue to improve the underlying business and our cash generation growth opportunities and so forth. And then from a cash standpoint, we have had $0.2 billion in cash this quarter and so far, year-to-date $0.4 billion and we're expecting $1.5 billion to $2 billion for the year now. Last quarter, we thought it may be closer to $2.5 billion. So, it has some deferral of $0.5 billion to $1 billion into 2020. But as you said, there is ways to go yet and lots of opportunity ahead to continue to redesign the business for the future. Colin Langan : Got it. And in the quarter, commodity costs have really come down quite dramatically and I know your contracts are lagged, but looking into the second half, I mean is that going to be a tailwind and are you factoring in a tailwind to your guidance or any color there on the commodity? Tim Stone : So, on the commodity front, we were at $0.2 billion adverse to the first half, but beyond what we've seen thus far as it relates to macro trends or expectations is factored into the guidance. So, there's no further commentary I'd offer for the back half of the year. Colin Langan : Okay. Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. James Hackett : You bet. Operator : And our next question is from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Ryan? Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It's great to see on Slide 40 in the appendix, so many EBIT drivers of the consolidated operations in China being positive year-over-year in 2Q amidst a tough industry. With that said, given the relative size of the consolidated and the non-consolidated operations in China, it would seem the biggest opportunity for improvement is probably in the JVs, which were roughly flat year-over-year in 2Q. Can you give us some indication of what is happening within that relatively placid $4 million change in EBIT or equity income? I imagine material volume declines may be offset by cost. And then I think you have downplayed expectations for much improvement in the JVs this year given the obvious industry headwinds and that the improvement will instead come from the consolidated ops, but going forward how much of a driver do you think improving JV income could be and when might we start to see some evidence of that? James Hackett : I think that's an excellent question and I want you know it's something we talk about. Joe? Joseph Hinrichs : Yes. Sure. So, thanks for the question. There is no question that in order for us to achieve the results, we're looking for over time in China our joint ventures, especially the Changan Ford joint ventures needs to improve its performance. I'd say that we have a lot of work to do. You referenced the consolidated operations \u2013 improvements in the second quarter and first half of the year. And part of it is the volume losses that we've seen and the due to sales, but also managing the inventory down to the lowest level in 18 months. We feel good about that. But going forward, we've just rebuilt the marketing and sales organization over the last several months with some very good hires and some very good restructuring. We're getting very strong participation with our joint venture partner, especially Changan and the rework we're doing with our marketing sales organization and the dealer relations. It's going to take some time to rebuild all of that, but I would say that we're on a path that we've seen over the last couple of months, we saw stability in our sales really for the first time in about 18 months or so. We have a lot of work to do. Part of it will be cost, of course. We have right-sized at least the manning part of our manufacturing. There's a lot more work to do, given the lower volumes on the overall manufacturing footprint. But the biggest opportunity for us is to rebuild the dealer profitability, the dealer engagement and the marketing sales organization in the joint venture and what to see \u2013 how long that takes, but we are making some good progress, but it's going to take some more time, and so \u2013 then of course the new products. Remember that, we said that we're going to localize five more vehicles starting in 2019 that will help the joint venture, because the number of those products like Explore, Lincoln, Corsair are built in the joint venture. So, some of that localization will really help the joint venture and of course the new product launches we have over the next 18 months will help in the JV as well. So that's clearly our number one focus. James Hackett : And I would just add, it's not something we talk about a lot from this table, but there was a lot of turmoil and turbulence in the leadership in China for Ford. We had somebody that resigned for personal reasons, we replaced that. And then we had another change. And so, I want to tell you with my tour, that Joe and I, we really feel good about the management team that's in place there and a lot of momentum starting to build with them and because how long it's been there? Joseph Hinrichs : Yes. I think starting this in November. James Hackett : November. Joseph Hinrichs : So, not even close to a year and really starting to getting some momentum there. James Hackett : Yes. So, I just want to make sure that you guys hear that. James Hackett : So, with the operator, I think it's time for us to wrap up. If it's okay, I'll go ahead and close with a few thoughts. I just want to say that our second quarter results demonstrate that this global redesign of Ford is driving positive shifts in our business and may emphasize today that the news in Europe is better and the redesign that we took with the bureaucratic structure of the company is \u2013 we met all the goals there. So, there is a lot of good news in this year of execution regarding that. Thus, we are improving our fitness and that was a goal to make us more competitive. We are driving a winning portfolio. The logic, as you know, to move out of the sedans and the products like Ranger are paying off and we see ourselves fortifying strengths and improving mix and there's a really strong commitment as Adam asked us to expand that electric vehicle portfolio quickly. And, lastly, the trajectory of the company is improving. We believe \u2013 and strong in terms of growth, cash flow and profitability. So, let me thank you for your attention this evening, and I'll turn it back to the operator.

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] After the question-and-answer session, there will be closing remarks. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn? Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, Holly. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's third quarter 2019 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Joe Hinrichs, President, Automotive; Jim Farley, President, New Business, Technology and Strategy; and David McClelland CEO of Ford Credit. Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of the quarter and progress against our strategic initiatives. Tim will follow with a more detailed look at our results and then we'll turn to Q&A. Following Q&A, Jim Hackett will have a few closing remarks. Our results comments today will include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found, along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Actual results may differ from those stated, and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 22 of our presentation. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. As a reminder, in 2020, we will update the business units in our Automotive segment to align with changes to our management and reporting structure. To help you with this transition, our earnings deck appendix has a schematic of the changes including where certain joint ventures will be reported. Also, our revised 2018 and 2019 results show how they will appear in the new reporting structure. Investor relations team is available if you have specific questions about these changes. Now I will turn the call over to Jim. James Hackett : Thanks, Lynn, and hello everyone. Overall, the Ford team delivered solid operational results in the third quarter, while at the same time we made further progress on the global redesign of the company. We know though that we have much more work to do. As this is the mandate at Ford, executing in the now while transforming into a much more fit, agile, and customer-centric company that can win in an era of rapid change and innovation.  Our team is operating with urgency and a focus to meet these challenges. Please turn to Page 4. Now touching briefly on the quarter, we generated positive adjusted free cash flow. The year-to-date adjusted free cash flow was up 80%, largely driven by improvement in our Automotive business. In the quarter, we delivered $1.8 billion in company-adjusted EBIT.  That was up 8% supported by improvement in our businesses in China, North America, and Europe, as well as mark-to-market gains in corporate other and another strong performance by Ford Credit. In year-to-date EBIT for Automotive, it was up 10% and company-adjusted EBIT increased 6%. Please turn to Page 5. At the highest level, our global redesign is about making choices to transform Ford into a more fit and competitive company. Simply put, we are absolutely committed to improving execution and addressing under performance throughout the company.  I will walk you through our business region by region. In our North American business amidst an intensified competitive environment, we are in the middle of an extensive product renewal. Reminding you that we are significantly refreshing and growing our SUV portfolio, introducing models like the completely redesigned Ford Explorer and Escape, and our all new Lincoln Aviator and Corsair.  And I am pleased to say that we are approaching now full production on the new Explorer and Aviator. This product renewal comes as we also phase out our most traditional sedan silhouettes. And again, our intent isn\u2019t to give up customers in that Sedan segment, rather to enhance their view of Ford\u2019s potential to please them in even a better vehicle.  We also plan to protect and expand our leadership in pickups and commercial vehicles. Look for a new Super Duty pickup in the coming months, and our all new F-150 next year. In a few weeks, we are introducing battery electric vehicles that\u2019s designed from the ground up to offer stunning performance, gorgeous design, and an incredible customer experience that is fully connected and updatable over time.  We also have big plans for the long awaited rebirth of the Bronco franchise. So, Ford is expanding into battery electric vehicles and rugged off-road SUVs, challenging brands that have had those two growth areas to themselves for long enough.  In total, I remind you that we are in the process of replacing 75% of our North American lineup by volume by the end of 2020, dramatically improving the freshness and appeal of our portfolio. The Ford team in Europe is making rapid strides in restructuring the business. We have reset our revenue and cost base and are rationalizing our product portfolio.  Europe is now focusing on three business groups; a strong and growing commercial vehicle business, a smaller and more profitable passenger vehicle business, and a niche portfolio of profitable and brand enhancing imported vehicles. So, going forward, you will see us redeploy capital to build on our position as Europe\u2019s number one commercial vehicle brand.  In addition, our country-specific product plans have us on track to deliver against the new European 2021 CO2 targets without penalties or fines using new hybrid and electric propulsion choices. We are clearly not satisfied with our standing in China, and the team is working exhaustively to return to profitable growth in this important market.  We are working to stabilize the business and are now launching new products that are tailored to the needs of Chinese customers. At the same time, we are attacking cost, reinvigorating our dealer network, and improving sales and market capabilities.  In South America, we are restructuring our operations to be far more asset light. And as you know, we made the decision to exit our heavy truck business. We reduced our management employee base by a full 20%, and we downsized our regional headquarters and rationalized the dealer networks in both Brazil and Argentina.  Finally, we recently announced the formation of our International Markets Group. We will refer to this as IMG, which brings together 100 high-potential emerged and emerging markets including India, Australia, ASEAN, the Middle East, Africa, and Russia. This is all under one leadership team. Emerging markets are growing at almost double the rate of the global industry. By 2024, one in three vehicles in our industry will be sold in these markets. Having the right business model to profitably address this opportunity is critical, and that\u2019s precisely what IMG will do.  Now please turn to Page 6. An important enabler of the strategy is the agreement we reached earlier this month with Mahindra. The joint venture will help Ford profitably grow in India and unlock the low-cost product development capabilities we need to grow in emerging markets. Ford will benefit from Mahindra\u2019s lower-cost platforms and value-focused engineering.  Mahindra, on the other hand, will gain from Ford\u2019s global reach, quality, and technology, and that includes the battery electric vehicle. We are also taking strategic actions to prepare Ford to compete and lead in an industry that\u2019s being profoundly reshaped through connectivity, the sharing economy, automation, and new forms of propulsion. You can think of this as the smart vehicles for a smart world.  We are scaling products and businesses that connect to the world around them in ways that benefits customers. With all elements of Ford\u2019s Smart Mobility now in one organization led by Jim Farley, we are sharpening our focus on where to play and how to win across this broad mandate. We are not able to reveal all the work we are doing in this exciting and fast-moving era, but there are few things that I can share.  We are prioritizing investments in connected vehicle services that will improve the customer experience, and this will enable Ford to transition from what has been historically a largely product-led offering to an ever improving and much stickier suite of products, accessories, services, and experiences, all bundled together. These investments have a sharp focus on customer data privacy and safety. They will open new opportunities to realize value from connected vehicle data and deliver outstanding experiences for our retail and commercial customers. And we\u2019ll have more to say about all of this in the future.  And as you know, we are also developing mobility services like Spin which is among the top three micro mobility companies in the U.S. with a footprint in 60 markets and growing and over three millions rides year-to-date, Spin is expanding Ford\u2019s reach and areas that we believe will contribute to an even stronger base for our Autonomous Vehicles businesses.  Speaking of AVs, last month, we announced Austin as our third market for our Autonomous Vehicle services. Together with Argo AI, we are currently mapping the city and we\u2019ll gradually increase the size of our fleet like how we are growing out operations in the first two cities, Miami and Washington DC. We are constantly learning from our expanding deployment of AV technology and services.  This space has shifted and evolved significantly even since the formation of our AV LLC in 2018 and we expect it to remain dynamic in the coming years. Our team is focused on building a successful, sustainable, and scalable self-driving vehicle service. And to this end, we remain focused on our plans for initial commercialization of the self-driving service in 2021 and we will begin to scale that service once we are able to remove the safety driver from the vehicle.  Before I turn the call over to Tim, let me address our full year outlook. We are experiencing more headwinds than expected in our fourth quarter. Especially, higher warranty, as a result, we have lowered our adjusted EBIT guidance range to $6.5 billion to $7 billion which suggests we will not grow adjusted EBIT this year as we intended.  Of course, we are disappointed in this. But we are confident that we are laying the groundwork for sustained improvement in profitability and cash flow over time.  In terms of warranty costs, we are feeling the downstream impact is from products designed earlier in the decade that we\u2019ve taken extensive actions to improve long-term quality and durability including centralizing core engineering responsibility and bolstering our systems integration and design assurance processes. These actions are already bearing fruit as we are seeing an improving trend in quality studies on our models.  Now, let me turn the call over to our CFO, Tim Stone. Tim Stone : Thanks, Jim. Hi, everyone. Ford\u2019s results this quarter demonstrate we are making progress and delivering on our commitments to customers and other stakeholders. However, it\u2019s clear, we have much more work to do. We are focused on consistently improving customer experience and operational execution across our business. We are making progress on a global redesign making the tough choices to lay the groundwork for improvement and future growth, free cash flow, profitability and returns on capital.  We are positioning forward to lead and win through fitness. For example, holding structural cost flat to down excluding pension and OPEB, and forming the JV with Mahindra. We are prioritizing meaningful opportunities for profitable, long-term growth in Mobility and disciplined execution is driving strong results from Ford Credit. In the third quarter, we generated $207 million in adjusted free cash flow, year-to-date, adjusted free cash flow was up 80% to $2.3 billion supported by lower capital expenditures, higher distributions for Ford Credit and continued improvement in working capital in Auto business. Adjusted free cash flow is our most important financial measures and we are committed to generating sustainable growth over time.  Cash and liquidity of $22 billion and $35 billion remain above our targets. We remain committed to investment-grade credit ratings and a strong balance sheet. Wholesale declined 8% in the quarter, primarily driven by Europe, China and South America. Revenue was down 2% largely as a result of foreign exchange. Auto EBIT was $1.3 billion in the quarter with a margin of 3.9% as higher pricing and flat structural cost excluding pension and OPEB were offset by higher materials costs associated with product launches, higher warranty expenses and adverse currency exchange.  Our strategic investments in Mobility increased 48% as we continue to build out capabilities in connected services in Autonomous Vehicles. For the end of this year, 100% of Ford\u2019s new vehicles in the U.S. will be shifted to connectivity and we are targeting 90% globally by the end of 2020.  Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, posting a 9% increase in earnings before taxes. Loss metrics reflected healthy and stable consumer credit and auction values for off-lease vehicles were slightly better than expected. We now believe auction values will be down about 2% on average for the full year and receivables were $149 billion.  Corporate other of $18 million included mark-to-market and other investment gains of $113 million including $77 million from pivotal software. On an adjusted basis, company EBIT increased 8% to $1.8 billion and our EBIT margin expanded to 40 basis points to 4.8% driven by improvement in our businesses in China, North America and Europe.  Mark-to-market gains in corporate other and another strong performance by Ford Credit. EPS is $0.34 and our tax rate in the quarter was 10.7%. In the third quarter, we recorded $1.5 billion in special item charges with cash effects of about $300 million. Actions related to our global redesign accounted for $1 billion in EBIT and a majority of the negative cash effects. As expected, most of the third quarter global redesign charges were for an impairment in India related to the planned formation of our joint venture with Mahindra. Special charges in the quarter also included $300 million in non-cash pension remeasurement losses and a $187 million for an unfavorable customs ruling.  For the full year, we now expect to incur $3 billion to $3.5 billion of EBIT charges as a result of global redesign with negative cash effects of about $1 billion to $1.5 billion.  Let me touch in a few areas of the business in more detail. North America wholesale units were down modestly. Launch-related ramp up of all new Explorer and Escape, the overlap of very strong production of F-series in the third quarter of last year to compensate for the decline in production volume caused by the Meridian fire and our decision to exit low-margin sedans were largely offset by the favorable impacts of our new Edge introduced at the end of 2018 and also Ranger. As a reminder, we plan to start production of the new Super Duty in the fourth quarter.  Revenue grew 5% supported by higher pricing and improved mix. EBIT increased 3% with a margin of 8.6% driven by higher pricing and volume in the U.S. which were partially offset by launch-related production costs and higher warranty expenses. As a reminder, we expect to conclude our negotiations with the UAW in the fourth quarter and to recognize the full impact of ratification-related payments as part of our adjusted results.  In Europe wholesales declined 15%, primarily because of our redesign actions to exit low margin businesses, including discontinuation of the C-Max Sedan. Revenue which was down 14% or 9% excluding the impact of currency was also affected by the lower volumes.  At the same time, the benefit of Europe\u2019s redesign were evident in the EBIT which improved 27% in the quarter. This is the first time in three years that Ford has posted consecutive quarters of year-over-year improvement in European profitability. This performance is attributable to lower structural costs, stronger product mix and higher profits from our commercial vehicle JV Ford Auto. It was included to lower volumes and adverse currency exchange rates.  In China, wholesales declined 12% and consolidated revenue is down 27% as improvements in mix and pricing were more than offset by lower volumes, and component sales to the joint ventures in the country.  Our EBIT loss in China narrowed to $300 million, an improvement of $100 million year-over-year driven by lower structural cost and favorable market factors in consolidated operations. This is the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in profitability in China. As Jim mentioned, we are working to stabilize our China business and working intensively to return into profitable growth. Deal engagement and profitability are starting to improve and we continue to keep production aligned to demand and ensure appropriate levels of dealer stock.  Please turn to Page 20. While our third quarter results demonstrate positive improvements in the trajectory of some areas of our business, we clearly have a lot more work to do. We are updating our outlook to reflect several headwinds that have intensified since the last gave guidance. The first is higher warranty, particularly related to coverages; the second is higher incentives than planned in North America; and the third is China due to lower volumes and JV profits.  Taking these factors into consideration, we are now targeting a full year adjusted EBIT in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion, compared with $7 billion last year. This implies our fourth quarter adjusted EBIT range of $0.6 billion and $1.1 billion. We continue to expect strong market factors, lower full year auto structural costs excluding pension and OPEB, and strength in Ford Credit.  We still expect adjusted free cash flow to be up to the full year driven by our Auto business and we remain committed to driving growth in cash flow and profitability over time. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate of around 12% to 13%, which is lower than our previous expectations, largely driven by more clarity on provisions in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017.  This would yield adjusted EPS in the range of 120 to 132 compared with 130 last year. Relative to calls on capital for the year, we expect CapEx to be about $7.5 billion, down year-over-year reflecting benefits from our fitness initiatives, funded pension contributions to be about $750 million and shareholder distribution to be about $2.6 billion.  Our guidance assumes no material change in the current economic environment, including commodities, foreign exchange and tariffs. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks uncertainties and other factors including those detailed in our filings with the SEC.  Before we move to Q&A, there are couple things that encourage you to keep in mind as you think about Ford, today and for the long-term. First, our customers are informing and driving everything we do.  That\u2019s why 2019 and 2020 are such robust launch years for us in North America. We are bolstering our winning portfolio of vehicles, based on what consumers want and need, reallocating capital to those higher return growth opportunities and carrying out changeovers of our highest volume and most profitable vehicles. And second, we are determined to always get better to persistently focus on our fitness, and continuously improve our operating productivity.  While we see increased headwinds in our fourth quarter, we were biased for action and are intensely executing on the inputs that will enable us to capture the opportunities across our business that will allow us to drive free cash flow along with long-term growth in revenue and profitability including adjusted EBIT margins of 8% or better and we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and holding investment-grade credit rating.  Now, let\u2019s open the call for questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America. John Murphy : Hi, good afternoon guys and thanks for the call. Just a first question on to the rest of the year related to the fourth quarter, even when you back out the UAW bonuses, it looks like you're doing $1 billion, $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter.  So, it seems like it\u2019s a little bit on the light side, and you very specifically highlighted higher-than-planned incentives in North America. I am just curious are you seeing something on the competitive front where pricing is getting much more difficult, and it just kind of seems a little bit odd after you just posted a $700 million positive net price in the third quarter. Just it doesn\u2019t seem to match up with what you just did, so something changed dramatically in the competitive environment? James Hackett : Hey, John, Jim Hackett. Let me ask Joe to bring you up to date on that. Joseph Hinrichs : Hi, John. Thanks for the question. So, if you look at it, the simple answer to your question is, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything dramatically changed in the environment at an industry level. Let me explain to you what\u2019s going on. For example in the third quarter, Ford\u2019s incentive increase year-over-year was slightly lower than what the industry average was for the U.S. market in the third quarter.  What\u2019s happening in the second half of the year, our incentives overall are slightly higher than we\u2019d expected versus our plan for the year. That\u2019s largely driven by a couple of products. If you look at Ranger launch this year, it\u2019s gone very well. We had a \u2013 we\u2019ve been regaining share every month this year, and we had 18% segment share in September. But as you could expect the competitors haven\u2019t let us just grow that share without any fight, so we\u2019ve seen a little bit higher incentives on Ranger than we had expected given the launch of the vehicle this year, still very optimistic about the product. It won APEAL, won IQS for JD Power, but the incentive spend on that product has been a little higher than we\u2019re expecting in the second half of the year.  If you look at what happened in the summer months, our competition on F-series was very aggressive; and so in September, we took some actions. We saw our segment share in F-150 come back up in September, and so we had to take some actions there. And Edge is in a very competitive segment, a little more competitive this year than we had planned for the year. So, that\u2019s kind of where you look at it, but in general that\u2019s more us versus our plan for the second half of the year. But I was referring to the U.S. industry in the third quarter as a reference point. Incentives are still pretty much under control and the industry is behaving in a pretty rational way so far. John Murphy : Okay. And then just a second question, and this might be a little bit more for Joe. But Jim, obviously I\u2019d love to hear your view on this. There was a lot of concern around the Explorer launch, and it sounds like there was a lot of problems there, but it seems like you\u2019ve got your arms around it and are ramping up pretty well. Just curious was that story overplayed in the press?  And we all got a little bit too concerned about that? And are there any lessons that you\u2019ve learned for product launches, because obviously you have a ton coming down the pipe in the next 12 months from that process that you can apply going forward to kind of make sure we don\u2019t have this kind of kerfuffle or issues going forward? James Hackett : I think I should \u2013 John, it\u2019s Jim Hackett, I think I should confirm that we have higher expectations for our performance and it\u2019s my experience in the short time that I\u2019ve been here that Ford is really good at this. And so, Joe can add some color here, but the challenge, what I call the design problem is that we had to ramp down a really profitable vehicle. We had to clear out the plant literally bulldoze everything out, build a new plant inside, get it started and not drop any volume in the midst of that. So, it was pretty aggressive and as I look at that, I want to win like that in the future. But we fell short in a few ways. In fact, Joe just took my whole team through a deep dive on what we\u2019ve learned from that.  I was very impressed with kind of the granularity of what we do understand of how the things that should have gone better didn\u2019t. But what I am not concerned about is whether we get it and whether we have a grasp of how to get control of it. I\u2019ll let Joe share with you because of course we are getting daily updates, the latest status of where we are on Explorer. Joseph Hinrichs : Yes, thanks, Jim. Thanks, John. So, really an important launch for us clearly, just to step back for a second, just so far this year, we launched the Ranger, all new in North America, very successful launch. Very unusual that it wins in its segment in IQS in the first year of introduction. Just launched Escape and Corsair down at Louisville, and that launch has gone very. It\u2019s gone and we are ahead of plan actually on that launch.  So the Explorer, Aviator launch is a very unique situation. As Jim said, we are disappointed in our overall performance in the ramp up of the volume. The products themselves are wonderful. The Aviator is a fabulous product. About half the sales of Explorer so far are FZ and Platinum, and if you haven\u2019t driven an FZ, really challenge you do so. It\u2019s a lot of fun and.. James Hackett : They won\u2019t give it back. Joseph Hinrichs : Yes, so, you are right. So \u2013 but back to the launch, so, Chicago is our oldest plant. It was launched in 1924. It's very constrained as far as physical location and as far as land and area around the plant. Simply put, we took on too much. We signed up for too much at launch. We tried to launch on 3 crew, which we didn\u2019t even try to do when we launched the Aluminum F-150 back in 2014. We launched the Aviator and Explorer both at the same time. We had the high reversion of Explorer. We had the Police Interceptor. We had Black Label Aviators. We had all this content and simply put with the new - with the product going from front-wheel drive to rear-wheel architecture, all new assembly line, all new body shop, all those things at once we took on too much and we shouldn\u2019t have it.  And so, part of the lessons learned is obviously go back to how we manage these launches and sequence them in a way that gives the team a chance to be successful. Our wholesales were down in the third quarter about 19,000 Explorers year-over-year. And we also had an additional 6,000 aviators that weren\u2019t in the year previous year. And so, we feel really good about the fourth quarter. The last week or so, we\u2019ve been running about 59 JPH. We are actually running out of parts from our suppliers as we\u2019ve started to ramp up. We used to run at 60 JPH. So we are just about where we have been historically in that plant, plus we have the Show Center, the new additional line coming online starting about 6 JPH by the end of the month. So, we actually feel really good about where we are right now. It\u2019s been a lot of work and a lot to get here. The products look great. We have plenty of available inventory now in the dealers and we are excited about where they are going to go from here. John Murphy : Okay. Joseph Hinrichs : And for the rest of the launches, John, Super Duty launch looks good this year. Transit launch looks good this year. Puma in Europe looks good. We had a lot of work to do for next year's launches, but I feel good about where we are for the rest of the year. John Murphy : Okay. And then, one quick last one on Ford Motor Credit, given the rate environment is shifting around on us in a direction that we expected 12 months ago, you had the credit downgraded Moody\u2019s. Just curious, as you are managing Ford Motor Credit, has anything changed in the way you are thinking about the business?  And where are we on the shift of getting better return on assets on sort of a constrained, purposely constrained asset base? And could we see returns improve or profitability improve as soon as next year based on sort of those actions? James Hackett : So, John, Jim Hackett. I am going to hand it to David McClelland. As an former bank board member managing through the crisis in this last decade, I am really proud of the Ford Credit discipline and in fact, our efficiencies improved. We aren\u2019t using more leverage to improve returns. So, we are very careful about that. But David, you can talk about and the great news we keep getting from Ford Credit. David McClelland : Yes, John. Hi, this is David. So, I am echoing what Jim is saying. I am very comfortable with the way the credit company is going. The portfolio looks very strong. I mentioned this in the last earnings call and I haven\u2019t seen any change in that. We manage as you know, we manage our business. We\u2019ve stated that we want to keep it around $150 billion. We manage the leverage between 8 to 9 as Jim just mentioned. You guys know how much equity is employed in the business and you know that we expect to get and we made this quite public in 12% return on that equity. So, when you do the math, our expected earnings should be about $2 billion.  This year, we have had \u2013 you referenced it in your question, we\u2019ve had good news, interest rate versus what we expected. So we have seen that in our DMV numbers and the used vehicle performance has been better than we expected. You\u2019ve said now that we think the used vehicles will be down about 2% for the year. We are about 1.8% so far for the year.  I know that that\u2019s slightly different to what Manheim has said, but then I look specifically at the trend last year in used vehicles and I look at what happened in the fourth quarter last year. And then, most important we allocate the return mix and the Manheim is of the 2001 segmentations. When you look specifically at the Ford Credit return mix, I feel comfortable that 2% is about right. So, overall \u2013 go ahead. John Murphy : Yes, but is there been any shift in the portfolio so far maybe away from dealer floor plan financing to maybe a higher-margin retail business? I'm just trying to understand where we are in through that shift? David McClelland : The floor plan in the U.S., the amount of floor plan we do in the U.S. is pretty constant. I would expect it to stay there. We do most of the floor plan in Europe. We haven\u2019t seen a change in China. Our Fico is pretty constant on our sort of marginal business as you\u2019ve seen over the last ten quarters remained constant at 6%. So we are not seeing any change. John Murphy : Okay, great. Thank you very much. James Hackett : Thank you, John. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache, Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Hi, everybody. James Hackett : Hi, Rod. Rod Lache : Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple. Just on Q4, just to follow on John\u2019s question, North America, it equates a bit lower than expected in the quarter and I was wondering, is there an unusual warranty catch-up impact in there? How should we be thinking about warranty which is up a lot over the past few years, anything in there that shouldn\u2019t recur next year?  And then, also on pricing, I am still puzzled by what changed relative to incentives. Just thinking about the market, one of the biggest changes that\u2019s happened since your last call is that GM has had a strike and their in-transit pipeline is basically emptying out.  So, if anything with your biggest competitor declining to maybe 50 days of inventory, I would think that the pricing environment gets better from here. So it sounds like you disagree. I was hoping you can elaborate. James Hackett : Thanks, Rod. This is like the Chicago thing. I just want to make it clear that the management team, starting with me understand that warranty is an opportunity for us to fix things that underlying challenges in our processes or the way we\u2019ve done things. It\u2019s my early work that I got involved in, Rod, in fact, when we met in New York in our first gathering, I talked to you about this that we attack the product development process with a lot of vigor. And you understand the gestation period in the auto industry. So a lot of the improvement that we have made, Jim Farley, Joe Hinrichs, myself, how tie tang in getting the portfolio to generate all the new products that we are talking about coming with less capital committed that we \u2013 that was planned when this new regime started $20 billion less.  I am confident that the work that the PD process is undertaking is going to generate better performance. However, with that said, Joe and I are committed to control of our business and we\u2019ve been surprised ourselves by some of these things because these are, Joe will explain, products and service, some that are longer three and four years out that.  Of course, we have to deal for our customers with problems and we\u2019ll do that. There is also with the DPS 6 transmission, we made a decision as a team to remove any kind of questions from ongoing ownership of the vehicles beyond really first ownership that the company would stand by in the performance of the products.  So this is a big Ford commitment to make sure that no one was suffering through that product challenge. I feel really good from what the company can control that we got a handle on that.  So let me just summarize by saying warranty is getting a lot of attention and the first thing is that the PD process has been restructured in the smart redesign house work there was kind of leading the company. But the benefits of all that, or in the next-generation of products. So Joe, maybe you can comment like on these historical products, what we\u2019ve learned. Joseph Hinrichs : Yes, Rod, thanks. So, as you look at it, the bulk of the warranty cost increases are in North America. It\u2019s 2018 model year and before that are the model years where we\u2019ve seen an increase in the higher time in service warranty claims than we had accrued for and have been planning for. That\u2019s largely driven by some power train actions. Some of those suppliers some of them are own, as Jim suggested, we\u2019ve done a lot of rework on our product development process to make sure we\u2019ve learned from this. But we have to get this bubble work into our system that we are seeing is here. We are seeing really good progress in our 2019 model year vehicles at the same point in time including six months, nine months in service, those kind of things.  So, we feel really good about the progress we are making. But we have this 2018 model year and a few years before that and working its way through the system. The way our process works, of course, we accrue the forward models based on the experience we\u2019ve been having.  And so, it takes a little while for that to work its way through the system. But that\u2019s what you are seeing. It is largely in North America from that perspective and that\u2019s what you see.  On U.S. incentives, I just want to go back to what I was saying before, first of all, we haven\u2019t seen a markedly different approach by any of our competitors in the marketplace recently. We will watch that very carefully of course. F-150 transaction prices are $3000 higher than the all new Ram and Silverado even though our truck is couple years older.  But we are watching, as I said, there are couple of segments where we saw some changes in the dynamics that we didn\u2019t plan for in the second half Ranger and Edge were two of them I was referring to. But I also said that, that we saw in the third quarter and we\u2019ve also seen in October so far that market has been pretty disciplined to your point and we are watching that very carefully. But a little bit of the \u2013 the bulk of the guidance change is really warranty-related, just want to be clear. Some of these other issues are also important, but the warranty that we are seeing that we have to address some 2018 model year and before is really the majority of what changed in North America. Rod Lache : Could you just clarity what the charges for preexisting warranty that you are rolling through the numbers this year? And then, just my last question is, what signs should we be taking away looking at the international numbers and kind of thinking forward, obviously there is savings here in Europe, China and South America, but the volumes are down as well in those markets?  So, as you sort of look at what\u2019s happening here, any color on how we should be thinking about the trajectory of improvement from here as we think about next year, the positives on cost maybe higher compliance cost issues, that kind of things? James Hackett : Yes, so, Rod, on the go-forward warranty, what I have \u2013 what Tim and Joe have done in the expectation for the year, they have given you that in terms of the way that years been projected. So we don\u2019t go out beyond that, of course, we have our normal reserve for warranty. But Tim, I am going to let you add any color that might help them a bit. Tim Stone : Yes, it\u2019s exactly as you said, and from a warranty cost perspective just to be clear, we do expect warranty to be up year-over-year. And again it\u2019s a key driver of our change in guidance for the fourth quarter. As accruals, we go through every quarter of course, then accruals are appropriate and reflect the experience as we have seen as warranties today through that point of time. James Hackett : And Joe, you might talk about the color in Asia. Joseph Hinrichs : Yes, on the international markets, Rod, we\u2019ve seen progress obviously this year in Europe and in China. I think the European team is really making a lot of progress on redesign work that\u2019s been in place now for quite some time.  I feel good about the progress we're making. South America, still in some pressure from what\u2019s going on in Argentina, but the South America business continues to make improvements as well in their restructuring. So both Europe and South America are really well on plan where we want them to be on the redesign efforts.  On China, our sales have not come up as fast as we were expecting them to in the second half of this year. Part of that\u2019s industry, but part of that\u2019s our own performance. We are really seeing the dealer network starting to really grow their sales force, their profitability is returning, so - and our inventory is in really good shape.  So we are watching that very carefully. I think the one to watch is, what\u2019s the China industry and how well do we do with our new models that we are launching in the third quarter, like the Focus Active, the Edge ST and ST line, the Taurus, the Territory EV and number of our products coming. We need to show growth in our China volume. So, the volumes are down as you suggested. Part of that\u2019s intentional with some of the product changes we made, choices we made in Europe to gather some of that volumes and with the downsizing we are doing in Europe, we gather focus and \u2013 I am sorry, in South America, got our focus in Fiesta production.  That's by design. But I think hopefully, you\u2019ll see from here forward, we can grow the business in China with the products we have and you will see continued improvements in the European business. Rod Lache : Okay. Thank you. James Hackett : Thank you, Rod. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Joseph Spak, RBC Capital Markets. James Hackett : Hi, Joe. Joseph Spak : Hi, good afternoon. I guess, I want to turn back to North America and dive back into the Explorer a little bit. So, you mentioned wholesales in North America were down slightly. In the U.S., they were up slightly. I think that's pretty close to what you did from a production standpoint. So, I guess the real question is, were all those Explorers that we read about the challenges about wholesale this quarter?  Are there vehicles at Flat Rock, as has been reported? And even if they are at Flat, are they wholesaled? And I guess, if they were wholesale to set the dealers, if you are just still doing the rework on them, is that also some of the costs that might be considered in the fourth quarter? James Hackett : So, Joe Hinrichs can clear this up. I am not happy with the press\u2019 view of way we work through this. I mean, I am just going to I think tickle your fancy a little bit by having you understand how diversified changes are in the auto industry. When products come from all kinds of trajectories in terms of what makes them up, there is no companies that are vertically integrated anymore.  So the way the reporter talked about how things are moved around and shifted as an indication that the process was broken, that\u2019s just not fair. And we were doing things because we were trying to take some of the pressure off this job per hour or JPH that Joe talked about. We could reduce some of the complexity.  So that\u2019s - that actually worked. So that was \u2013 that\u2019s the way that was painted as a negative. It was actually misrepresented and what he was saying to you is that the wholesales were still down 19,000 units, but that was worst last quarter. So we\u2019ve made a lot of progress but Joe, I don\u2019t know if you want to add more to. Joseph Hinrichs : Sure, so, Joe let me just be clear. We shipped about, through the end of the third quarter, it\u2019s just the data I am referring to, we shipped about 96,000 units. We had about 9500 as inventory. Most of those were in Chicago. There is a couple of thousand still in Flat Rock. Just a reminder, there is no physical space around the Chicago assembly plant.  So, when we have any issue, there is no place to put the vehicle. And if you ever been in the south side Chicago, you know there is no physical space. But some of the reports have been overly dramatized. We've used the Flat Rock for many launches, because we - you do this in the past because Flat Rock right now is working on one shift. It has plenty of capacity. It has lot of skilled depot.  It has a rail yard nearby and when you are doing software updates or even if you are doing some physical repairs to the vehicle or doing some inspection, having skilled depot and having floor space and space in the yard to be able to do that is much more important to be able to do that with a good quality than trying to force it, moving vehicles around, because you have no physical space.  And so, we think we\u2019ll have all the inventory cleared up by the end of November. And we feel really good about that. We have plenty of inventory out in the field now for both Explorers and Aviators and the dealerships. A lot of that came on pretty quickly admittedly in the September and October, we\u2019ve been shipping.  Actually, in the last week, we've shipped a little more than we actually built, because we are actually starting to clear out some of those units. So we are shipping what we are building right now and we feel really good about the flow of that going forward. But we just don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t talk about it, but we\u2019ve leveraged Flat Rock a number of times over the last five or six years on launches. But unfortunately, the lost production that we had in the slower ramp up than we expected in Chicago led us people wanting to report on other things as well. So, our first and foremost approach, of course is attack the customers and keep them, yes, keep them well protected.  And I want to be clear about on your question, we don\u2019t recognize the vehicles as wholesale and in our revenue stream until they are released with good quality and saleable to the dealer and to the customer. So, all those vehicles that I am telling you that are still on hold, they are not wholesaled. We don't wholesale until we are - they're gate released with the quality to be able to be sold. James Hackett : In fact, that discipline is really important, because, if we lose one customer, can you imagine the future cash flow loss of losing a customer? So, it's better that we get this right. The other thing, Joe, is if you follow the transit business or the F-150 business, those have multiple factories.  So, when we're in the middle of launches with those vehicles, there is relief because of the way Joe Hinrichs can move things around. So, I am just echoing what he said to you, is Flat Rock was not evidence of chaos. It was evidence of us making sure things were right. Joseph Spak : Okay. On the automotive free cash flow is still higher year-over-year I noticed in the quarter, the Ford Credit distribution was up and I think year-to-date now it's at $2.4 billion, which I think is only slightly below what you sort of kind of previously indicated for the year. So, within that guidance, are you raising the Ford Credit distribution for this year, because maybe the performance of Ford Credit is stronger?  And then while we're on cash flow, just maybe if you could provide an update on some of the cash with the redesigned cash flow, because again, that looks sort of light, the $1.5 billion to $2 billion you've indicated prior to this year, unless there is a big fourth quarter. James Hackett : So, Tim, you can field this. Tim Stone : You bet. This is Tim. So as it relates to Ford Credit, the cash distributions tend to track with profitability for Ford Credit and that's been consistent over time. So that will just be a natural flow. We haven't given specific Ford Credit cash flow guidance. But it\u2019s certainly factored into our expectation that we'll have growth in free cash flow, and it's been part of the 80% growth we've seen year-to-date so far this year. On the special items, the cash thus far in 2019 is in $0.7 billion and we had said in Q2 that we expected $1.5 billion to $2 billion of cash. We've had a deferral in that. Similarly, earlier in the year we expected $2 billion to $2.5 billion in cash. So we continue to refine our estimates of the cash ramifications from the restructuring actions that we're taking and I now expect $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2019. Again, $0.7 billion of which has already occurred. James Hackett : And that's\u2026 Joseph Spak : Just to be clear on the Ford Credit distribution, I guess, versus what you thought after the second quarter, embedded in the Automotive free cash, is the distribution higher than prior? James Hackett : Yes, we haven't given any specific commentary on when and how the flows occur. Again, they track with profitability over time. Joseph Spak : Okay. Operator : All right. Our next question is going to come from the line of Brian Johnson, Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes, good afternoon. So, a couple questions. First, vis-\u00e0-vis Ford Credit, since a lot of the other questions have been asked, I was a little bit surprised by the cut in - or the improvement in expected decline in auction values.  Given some softness we saw in Mannheim overall in the quarter, is there something specific to the kind of lease returns that you've been getting? Or, something that makes it a little bit better? And then, kind of as you kind of roll forward into next year, what's your expectation on that? James Hackett : Yes, Brian, I'll turn that to David. But I have to smile, because I am really proud of the brand. So I do think the brand carries when you are talking about F-150 pickup trucks and things like that. But David, am I right about that? David McClelland : Sorry. Thanks for the question. I think I touched on it a little earlier. So, we look at the performance year-to-date, which is down just short of 2% and then I looked at the performance last year, throughout the year and the trends actually over the last few years and then what happened last year in the fourth quarter. And then, specifically and importantly look at the return mix, which is what Jim was getting at and if you look at the return mix, remember Mannheim is off a really historical mix. James Hackett : Yes. David McClelland : So if you look at our specific return mix, I feel comfortable that the 2% number is about right. Brian Johnson : Okay, good. And he second question, as long as we are going into Ford Credit, there has been a lot of negativity in the press around extended loan terms, subprime, underwater trade-ins being rolled into the loan, which would imply poor loan to values. Can you comment A, just on the general industry trend there? And B, the Ford Credit specific approach to that? James Hackett : Well, again, Jim Hackett. I am going to warrant to you, the way we run this company is what I'd like to talk about and there is a lot of integrity in the way we think about this balance sheet and the way we handle customers. I don't really want to comment on the others. There are practices that you would see that we would not accept at Ford Credit. David? David McClelland : Sure. Yes, thanks. So that the - again, echoing what Jim said, not to talk about outside of Ford Credit, but I can talk with some confidence about the credit company itself. The business that we're putting on the books remains very strong where our FICO For the quarter is 750 and we're not moving at all on any of the higher risk business that we're doing.  And then, really to the heart of your question, we are not in the longer terms. We're not, even if the average transaction price is going up. We are not seeing any movement on our longer-term business, which the mix of that, the 84 month is only 3%.  There is nothing that I'm seeing in the performance in terms of delinquency, even the early, early defaults, non-delinquent defaults are not moving, 30, 60, 90s are fine. In our slides, there is a seasonality on the LTR, but that is simply seasonality.  Just look at 2Q18 versus 2Q19. Your prior questions about the disposals in terms of the residual values are pretty good. So, I mean we are staying diligent, but I am comfortable and confident that what you're reading about is not what you're seeing in the credit company. Brian Johnson : Okay, thank you. James Hackett : Thank you, Brian. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley. James Hackett : Hi, Adam. Adam Jonas : Thanks, everybody. Hey, Jim, how are you? James Hackett : Good. Adam Jonas : Good. Just two quick questions and apologies for the background noise, just wanted to zone in on the consolidated China business, which my understanding is imported products, it is, I know, very Lincoln heavy from the U.S. into China, calculating an operating margin loss of around negative 25%, negative 30%, that territory. Can you just again justify or explain why would you do that?  I guess, it doesn't strike me as a business worth doing. Do you have a choice to just stop doing that? Just to stop selling U.S.-made cars into China, which, for a variety of reasons, as a global automaker, you think you've got to make where you sell. Is that something you can stop doing? Or is there a story of, you are trying to keep the blood in the patient, the dealer lifeline kind of going and that can kind of we can cycle out of that and stop doing that stuff? James Hackett : Yes. Well, I think your analysis, as always, is really good and I mean, imagine together the way we ask Joe Hinrichs to plan with the tariff structure that is in, it's up, it's out, it's down. And so, I do think that I've been public and said a year ago when I asked about this, I thought there would be a resolution in the way that we'd have certainty and what I would say an equilibrium if you remember, that we could plan our business and Lincoln was responding really well to exports from here. That is an example where there is blood in the patient, so to speak. The brand was growing as fast as anything in the country, and we've made commitments. People had made commitments to us. I thought where you were going was also about the larger question of participation in China, which is something I am still committed to. I think there is a formula there, a business model that Ford can excel at. But Joe, I don't know if there is any more. You remember, Joe Hinrichs, who is now President of Automotive, also got us started in China. So he has had some, he was on the ground there and had experience. But the question Adam is asking, you know, of is there false \u2013 are we doing false things here that aren't sustainable? Joseph Hinrichs : Yes. It's a very fair question, Adam. I recognize our consolidated operations in China are complicated, because we have the Lincoln imported products that, some of the Ford imported products. We also have the cost structure of Ford-owned entities and employees in China and then we have our allocations from the corporation and from engineering, et cetera, are in the consolidated numbers.  So it's a compilation of a lot of things. Suffice to say, we don't believe in exporting vehicles at a contribution margin loss, as long as we don't have a spike in import duties that are a near-term issue. The solution to this largely is around localization plans for our business in China. We've been very public about, we have five more vehicles being planned to be locally assembled in the near term.  That includes the Lincoln Corsair and the Ford Explorer. So a number of products are going to be localized over the next year, year-and-a-half, which will really influence this. It will help us be more competitive cost-wise in the business in China, but also will take away some of the exposure we've had, just some of the fluctuations in tariffs.  So, we feel good about that plan. As you know and you noted, the Lincoln plan has been an import plan until now, when we started localizing Lincoln Corsair and then more to come from there, which will really help with this. So they're contribution margin positive. There is a lot of costs in the consolidated business. But this will largely get taken care of by the localization plans we have going forward. Thanks. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Joe and Jim, and if I can just sneak in one more on hybrids. There seems to be this referendum going on in global autos where some companies are kind of canceling their hybrid programs and saying very openly that they view them as kind of regulatory cars and kind of compliance vehicles that consumers don't really fully value, even if on paper they make sense and they are really complicated vehicles. And not a lot of capital to throw around. Others are moving straight to EVs.  And then some, I'd say like you and Toyota are in a camp of, hybrids are the real deal. They are going to be with us for a long, long time and consumers value them. Maybe Joe, for you, if I were to ask you kind of 5, 10 years out, you are in a long-term business where product you are planning now, some of it won't even be on sale for north of five years and it has to be on the road for 10 or 20 years.  If I put that longer-term hat on, are you equally bullish on hybrids as you are on EVs? If I force you to pick one, really that 10-plus years, where is the incremental Ford dollar going to invest? Joseph Hinrichs : Yes, Adam. Thanks. There is a lot there. So, when Jim Farley announced, I think it was now a little more than a year-and-a-half ago about $11 billion commitment to electrification, we were all in on all parts of this discussion. Yes, we see significant growth in our hybrid business over the next five years and part of that is, we think that where consumers are today and where costs are today, that makes a lot of sense for the economic choice of the consumer.  As you know, we're taking a portfolio approach to this. It isn't just about hybrids or plug-in hybrids, it also about electric vehicles starting with a very exciting vehicle next year and the other ones are coming after that. So I think you are talking about a transition period. We think that hybrids will continue to be part of the equation for a number of years to come.  But our BEV portfolio will grow substantially over the course of time and we think that ultimately is where this largely goes. But we do see a role for hybrids in the portfolio. Remember, we get questions all the time about, with the movement of sedans largely out of the North American portfolio, what happens if gas prices spike? Well, again, our portfolio approach, which we've been consistent all along, our new SUVs all have some kind of electrification as part of each nameplate we're launching, so that we can offer solutions to customers, if we should see a spike in fuel prices or other things.  So there is a number of reasons why it's important to us. But we are bullish on bad electric vehicles. We think it will be toward the end of the decade that will be a significant portion of the portfolio of electrification. But we do still see hybrids as being an important part of the portfolio, especially in the near term, where there is no compromise, no range anxiety for consumers. James Hackett : In fact, Adam, I loved when we had this exchange a year or so ago, I was doing the thing where I would bring up the computer industry as a proxy and we were saying can you convert that to thinking about automotive? You remember when computing was \u2013 where we were moving from chip size, Pentium, et cetera, and you would buy the next-generation computer based on that.  And of course, that's been blown up in terms of the way the markets now respond to computing. You know, what Apple has done in terms of the iPhone. We see the features and virtues, rather than what's inside of it. I think this is going to happen now in automotive. I give Jim Farley and Joe a lot of credit here, as Ford was leading in this way.  In other words, all the rhetoric was around, do you have electric vehicles or do you have hybrid vehicles? And we've got this exciting thing coming in November that is going to take advantage. Adam Jonas : I can't wait. James Hackett : I know and what I want you to imagine with me is the dialogue is going to start to shift, because the nature of the product is going to be what's talked about rather than the propulsion. Of course, we're committed to that. We've got this F-Series coming and of course you know we've been working on a battery electric inside of that.  Imagine when the Bronco comes, how exciting talking about Ford products is. So, I just want to say that I love where you are going with the question, and I'm really excited about the way Ford is interpreting that. Joseph Hinrichs : And just a reminder, as battery costs improve or lower, hybrids also become more affordable. It's not just about electric vehicles. So, that becomes also part of the equation for the customer. Adam Jonas : As long as the internal combustion part of the hybrid does not increase, does not offset that. But I get your point, Joe and I do appreciate both of you on that - answering the question. Thank you. James Hackett : Yes, thank you. And so, let me just close and say the third quarter results do have evidence of the global redesign of Ford. When you heard the news about how Europe persistently now is improving, and so it\u2019s driving these positive shifts. But, make no mistake, humility of the work that we still have to do, I am still very confident in the team here and the progress that Ford Motor Company is making.  We are focused on improving our fitness and our outcomes. This is driving a winning portfolio, where we're fortifying the strengths. As you heard me just mention a moment ago to Adam improving mix. And we're focused on laying groundwork to improve the trajectory of long-term growth in cash flow and profitability. That evidence is really starting to show up in the previous calls. You all asked us, are you sure your structural costs aren't rising? You know, we really have attacked this and I think we have a good handle there. And then a commitment by me personally that things that you would expect us to do better, that we are addressing, and we are. So thank you very much for your attention this evening. Operator : Thank you. This does concludes the Ford Motor Company third quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

My name is Holly, and I'll be today's operator. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn? And ladies and gentlemen standby, I believe we have lost our audio, one moment for the - for the speaker. Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, operator. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us are Joe Hinrichs, President, Automotive; Jim Farley, President, New Businesses, Technology & Strategy; and Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit. Jim Hackett will begin with a brief review of our results, progress against our strategic initiatives and guidance for 2020. Tim will follow with a more detailed look at our results and guidance, after which, we'll turn to Q&A. Following the Q&A, Jim Hackett will make closing remarks. Our comments today will include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Today's call will include forward-looking statements about our business. Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors for - that are included on page 26 of our presentation. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. References to company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is volume weighted. As a reminder, starting in 2020, we changed our business units in our Auto segment to align with how we now manage our business. To help you navigate this in the appendix of our earnings deck is a diagram of the changes, including where results from certain joint ventures will be reported. We've also included 2018 and 2019 results by quarter that coincide with the new reporting structure. The minor IR housekeeping. Going forward, we will announce the date for our next earnings release in conjunction with results for the previous quarter. For example, we are announcing today that the date for our 2020 Q1 earnings will be April 28. Please disregard our previously announced dates for July and October 2020. Now I will turn the call over to Jim. Jim Hackett : Thanks, Lynn. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. Please turn to page 3. At the start of this new decade, we are also at a crossroads for our industry and for Ford Motor Company. I believe, as I've said before, there is an incredibly bright future for Ford within what has become a very disruptive environment. And to realize this future, we undertook a fundamental redesign of the company to compete and win in this new era of smart vehicles in a smart world. On this call a year ago, I told you that 2019 would be a year of strategic action with potential for financial improvement. Now measured against the first part of that statement, 2019 was a year we took meaningful actions to improve our fitness and accelerate our transformation into a higher growth, higher margin business by leveraging smart connected vehicles and breakthrough customer experience. A powerful example of our company's move into the digital future was the November reveal of our Mustang Mach-E, an exciting zero emissions vehicle that will be fully connected and continually improved through over the year updates. We're encouraged by the interest and early orders around the world. Moving forward, virtually all our new vehicles will be connected, enabling Ford to vastly enhance customer experience and our ability to leverage data and analytics to constantly raise quality and reduce costs. Additionally, this past year, we forged strategic agreements and partnerships around the world, with VW, Rivian and Mahindra. This is to help position Ford for leadership in autonomous and electric vehicles and create new business models for profitable growth in emerging and emerged markets. We continued one of the most ambitious portfolio shifts in our history. Focusing our capital on growing profitable segments and playing to the strength of our brand. We are right on strategy to add compelling new products across segments, price points while phasing out unprofitable and commoditized vehicles in shrinking segments. And this will only accelerate moving forward, which benefits our share, bottom line, and most importantly customers. We also made significant progress on our global redesign in 2019. We took tough but important steps to strengthen our capabilities and create a more resilient Ford. Those actions included restructuring our operations in Europe and South America, assembling a talented new leadership team in China with strong local market expertise, and reducing the size of our salaried workforce around the world, flattening the organization and cutting down bureaucracy in the process. In the secondary, I talked about last year potential financial improvement, we fell short of our expectations and yours in 2019. What is particularly disappointing is that a primary reason for that shortfall was our operational execution and this is an area we are typically very effective in. Our execution was simply not nearly good enough. Clearly, we recognize this and of course we're accountable for it and we've taken steps to address these shortfalls. An example of this was the manufacturing launch of our all-new Explorer. The lost volumes in Chicago during ramp-up marred the year, and there were some important lessons that we learned. The good news is the Explorer is a fantastic vehicle and we've entered the year with strong customer demand for it. Financial improvement was also held back by the emergence of warranty issues primarily for vehicles designed years ago. So before I get into the numbers, let me make this very clear. Our leadership team is determined to return to world-class levels of operational execution. We will do that without losing any momentum in creating a Ford Motor Company that will thrive and generate long-term value in these fast changing times. To this end, we've made changes to our executive incentive plans, and we placed an even greater weight on free cash flow, which we think is the ultimate gauge of our success in driving growth and allocating capital to its best and highest uses. Please turn to page 4. Our full year revenue declined 3% and company adjusted EBIT of $6.4 billion was down 9%. This yielded an overall margin of 4.1%, and adjusted EPS for the year was $1.19. Importantly, we generated $2.8 billion in total company adjusted free cash flow. Our balance sheet, it remained strong with $22 billion in cash and $35 billion in liquidity, both of which are well above our target levels. Please turn to Page 5. As I mentioned in 2019, we significantly strengthened our portfolio around the world. New launches included that all-new Explorer I mentioned, Escape and Super Duty and the Puma in Europe, in addition to the reveal of our Mustang Mach-E. On a volume basis, this product renaissance will gather even more momentum in 2020 especially in North America. Ford F-Series was America's truck leader for the 43rd consecutive year. In the fourth quarter, F-150 volumes closed strongly with the segment share up year-over-year and sequentially. The new Ranger in its first full year of production in the US earned a 21% share of the mid-size pickup segment in the fourth quarter. And this contributed to our best year of total pickup sales since 2005. So we're quite proud with the F-Series and Ranger as a one-two punch. Ford was not only the leader in US full-size pickups, but also the leader in total pickup sales in 2019. In Europe, we started the rollout of 17 new hybrid and all-electric passenger and commercial vehicles, including the all-new Puma SUV. This broader electric portfolio shows how serious we are about meeting the region's new carbon footprint requirements. We launched our first ever fully electric vehicle in China with a version of Territory, and we announced we would introduce more than 30 market specific Ford and Lincoln vehicles, 10 of these will be electrified over the next three years. And as mentioned, our all-new Mustang Mach-E will reach customers late this year. Now all of these product supports Ford's commitment to achieve the Paris Climate Accord Glide Path for lower CO2 emissions. And at the same time, we maintain leadership around the globe with our franchise vehicles. Mustang, America's and the world's number one sports coupe. F-Series, along with Ranger, which is the number two medium-sized pickup outside the US, and number one in Europe. Explorer, America's all-time best selling SUV, and Transit the top cargo van globally. And while some automakers are clearly pursuing full-blown mergers for scale and cost sharing, Ford's strategy is based on strategic partnerships and alliances that will deliver benefits in key segments and markets, while improving our cost and capital efficiency. For example, our agreement with VW is structured to allow us to reap scale gains from our collective leadership position in light commercial vehicles and medium pickups, and in electrification and autonomous vehicles. Our joint venture with Mahindra will combine low-cost engineering and manufacturing optimized for India and export to other emerged and emerging markets, with more efficient levels of investment. With our equity position in Rivian and well matched strengths of the two companies, we can quickly bring to market an all-new BEV using Rivian's flexible platform. In fact, last week we announced, we are working with Rivian on Lincoln's first all-electric vehicle, building on the introduction last year of the Lincoln Aviator and Corsair Grand Touring plug-in hybrids. In terms of global redesign, Ford took decisive actions in both Europe and South America to fortify and build on strengths while addressing underperforming parts of those regional businesses. In Europe, we announced the closure of six manufacturing facilities, which will reduce our footprint to 18 facilities from 24. We also refocused our European product portfolio atop three pillars. One, strengthening our leadership in commercial vehicles. Two, delivering a targeted portfolio of passenger vehicles; and three importing iconic nameplates. Now in the process, we're reducing our workforce in Europe by 12,000 positions with more than half of that completed in 2019. In South America, we're moving to a lower cost asset-light business model. And last year, we exited production of heavy trucks. We closed our plant in San Bernardo and discontinued the Fiesta and Focus models. Over the past three years, we've reduced our total workforce in South America by more than 40%. In China, we completed the build-out of an experienced local leadership team and localized the first of five products, our Lincoln Corsair. The heart of Ford's vision is preparing the company to compete and win in this emerging era, we describe as smart vehicles for a smart world. A practical effect is we continue to invest in and expand our capabilities in mobility, connected service and autonomous vehicles, areas that will provide meaningful opportunities for growth. For example, Ford Commercial Solutions significantly grew its data and telematics subscriptions in 2019, building out the portfolio of services. We are leveraging those services in our large, profitable and expanding commercial truck franchises, which includes a sizable fleet market. In terms of autonomous vehicles, we continued our credible and holistic approach to building a successful, scalable and profitable AV business, focusing on the customer experience, the self-driving system, lead operations and designing our purpose-built self-driving vehicle. Ford AV, LLC and Argo AI now have joined autonomous vehicle testing operations in Austin, Miami, Washington DC, Pittsburgh, Detroit, in the South Bay Metro area and Silicon Valley. Now these six locations make up the largest urban AV testing footprint in the industry, providing us with a unique and invaluable diversity of real world miles driven. With that information, we are continuously optimizing Argo's self-driving system and positioning Ford exceptionally well for commercialization and subsequent scaling of this technology. Before I turn the call over to Tim, let me briefly touch on 2020. As I said at the start, we begin this decade with optimism and the conviction that we're taking the right steps to redesign and restructure our business, improve our fitness and prepare the company to compete and win in the future. 2020 will be the year we re-introduce Bronco to the world, the year, we completely redesigned the F-150, the year we'll start seeing the Mustang Mach-E on roads around the world. All these vehicles will be smarter and more connected and ever improving. We're focused on solid execution of our product launches this year, especially where there will naturally be downtime during changeover like the F-150. The cadence of these launches which are volume weighted towards the end of the year will drive headwinds for us in 2020, but they will strengthen our earnings and cash flow potential heading into 2021. Now, let me briefly talk about what we are seeing and doing relative to the Corona virus. As you would expect, our Ford team is proactively monitoring the situation on several fronts, including the safety of our employees and their families. This is paramount, business continuity including our JV partners in China as well as customers, supply chain management, logistics and of course where we can, we want to be part of the solution. So we are donating money and equipment where we can be most effective. Thus my strong instinct is to want to tell you what the impact of this virus may be on our business and our guidance for this year. However, it's simply too early. China is only now starting to come back from an extended New Year holiday. And many companies including Ford are currently hoping to resume large parts of their industrial operations next week. And that is most experts are already saying and we agree that it will take weeks to begin to understand the implications of the outbreak. In the meantime, we will describe our expectations for the business excluding the possible effects of the Corona virus. It is possible, though, that we could absorb a modest impact from the virus within our guidance range. For the year, we are driving for at least nominal growth in Auto as we continue our ambitious portfolio transformation. We expect this growth though to be offset by lower EBT from Ford Credit, and a modest investment increase in mobility. Tim Stone, our CFO will provide more color. In fact, now I will turn the call over to Tim. Tim Stone : Thanks, Jim. While our 2019 results were not okay, I'm confident we have abundant opportunities to improve our operational execution, drive growth, strengthen our financial results, including cash flow and in the process, earn the confidence of our stakeholders. We will achieve our potential and optimize long-term value through timely decisive actions to strengthen our business and execute on our long-term vision. These include applying sharp rigor to the allocation of capital to higher return investments, including our franchise products. As you heard me say in the past, we're focused on consistently improving customer experience and operational execution across our business. We're achieving important progress on our global redesign making tough choices to lay the foundation for improvement in future growth, free cash flow, profitability and returns on capital. We're driving fitness, for example scaling or improving the operating leverage of our structural costs and capital efficiency and forming alliances and joint ventures that will enable us to drive durable scale benefits. We're prioritizing meaningful opportunities for profitable, long-term growth in mobility and we will continue to employ disciplined execution to drive strong results from Ford Credit. Turning to our full year operating performance in 2019. Full year adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion was flat year-over-year as continued improvement in working capital in our Auto business, lower capital spending and higher distributions from Ford Credit were largely offset by the UAW contract related bonuses of about $600 million. Free cash flow is our most important financial measure and we're committed to generating sustainable growth over time. Our cash and liquidity are $22 billion and $35 billion respectively, above our target levels. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit ratings. Revenue declined 3% for the year, or 1% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. And adjusted company EBIT of $6.4 billion was down 9%. While full-year Auto EBIT declined, the benefits of our redesign, fitness initiatives and stronger product portfolio driven by our decision to reallocate capital to higher return products were evident in our underlying results. Led by North America, Auto delivered $2.4 billion in favorable market factors, another strong year for us. This is supported by improved mix and pricing across most regions. Auto structural costs, excluding pension and OPEB were down for the year, primarily as a result of improved fitness and global redesign actions. The decline in structural cost was a sharp contrast to before we embarked on fitness when those costs were increasing an average of nearly $2 billion a year. Within Auto these favorable trends were more than offset by lower volumes, including the temporary effects of new product launches and the discontinuation of sedans in North America and low-margin products in other regions. Higher net product costs as we continue to invest in the transformation of our product portfolio, unfavorable currency effects, UAW contract ratification costs, and higher warranty expenses. Regionally, we cut our loss in China by one-half year-over-year, and Europe is just shy of breakeven. Together these regions accounted for $1.1 billion in EBIT improvement. Outside of Auto, we increased our investment in mobility by more than 75% or $0.5 billion as we continued to expand our capabilities, and prepare for the launch of our AV business. Ford Credit had exceptional results, its best in nine years, delivering $3 billion in EBT. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we generated $0.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow, down year-over-year primarily due to UAW contract related bonuses. Wholesales, which were off 8% in the quarter contributed to a 5% decline in revenue. These drops were driven by lower volumes in all regions, including the temporary effects of product launches and the discontinuation of sedans in North America and low-margin products in other regions. Auto EBIT of $0.2 billion was down $0.9 billion as higher net pricing and mix, led by North America were more than offset by lower volumes, UAW contract related costs, higher net product costs related to new products and adverse currency exchange. Our strategic investments in mobility increased more than 75% or $0.1 billion, largely driven by higher investments in autonomous vehicles. Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter with $0.6 billion in earnings before taxes, down 5%. The decline was driven by lower receivables, partially offset by favorable residual and credit loss performance. Loss metrics continue to reflect healthy and stable consumer credit and auction values for off-lease vehicles were down 4% for the quarter and 2% for the year. For 2020, we expect auction values to be down about 5%. Company adjusted EBIT declined by $1 billion to $0.5 billion and our adjusted EBIT margin was down 227 basis points to 1.2% as improvement in China and Europe was more than offset by decline in North America. Looking at our largest regions in more detail. North America wholesale units were down 8% in the quarter. This is driven by a tough comparison to the fourth quarter of 2018 when we were at peak volumes with no major product launches, as well as by the launches of Super Duty and Escape and the planned discontinuation of sedans. The 2% decline in revenue was less than the decline in wholesales as improved mix and higher net pricing partially offset the decline in volume. EBIT was down 64%, and margin declined 480 basis points, largely as a result of UAW contract related bonuses and lower volumes. In Europe, where we are carrying out a dramatic redesign of our business, wholesale declined 4% due to the planned discontinuation of low-margin products. Revenue in Europe was down 4% or 1% excluding the impact of exchange. The decline in revenue, excluding exchange was less than the decline in wholesales as improved product mix driven by our portfolio actions largely offset volume effects. Decline in Europe's top line metrics is an outcome of our redesign and portfolio shift as we exit low-margin businesses and refocus our portfolio on higher growth and higher return opportunities. The benefit of this refocus is evident in a few areas, for example, profitability. In the fourth quarter, EBIT in Europe improved from a loss of $199 million to a profit of $21 million. This is the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year profitability improvement in the region. This progress includes stronger product mix and lower structural costs. Our redesign and portfolio shift in Europe also make us better prepared to deliver on the region's new CO2 requirements. Compliance with these new regulations has been built into our product cycle and business plans for several years, and we expect to achieve the new CO2 requirements without incurring fines or purchasing credits. In China, wholesales which include JV volumes were down 7%. This is the third consecutive quarter of moderating declines in volume. Consolidated revenue in China was down 38%, mainly because of lower volumes and component sales to joint ventures in the country. Our EBIT loss in China narrowed $200 million, an improvement of $300 million year-over-year, driven by decline in structural costs and improved joint venture results. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in results in China. For all of 2019, we were able to cut our losses by one-half as new products supported improved market factors including mix and net pricing. Lower tariffs and favorable exchange improved contribution margin, and our focus on overhead drove a significant decline in structural costs. We continue to emphasize dealer engagement and profitability along with inventory discipline, but keeping production aligned to demand. We've also made progress shifting our portfolio from imports to locally manufactured. In 2019, we launched Lincoln Corsair and expect to localize four additional vehicles in the future. In the fourth quarter, we recorded $2.7 billion in special item charges with cash effects of about $200 million. Actions related to our global redesign accounted for $0.4 billion in special item charges and all the negative cash effects. The balance of special item charges included $2.2 billion for a previously announced remeasurement loss related to our global pension and OPEB plans. In July, 2018, we announced plans for a global redesign, which included a potential $11 billion of EBIT charges and $7 billion of related cash effects to fund the rationalization of our cost structure, portfolio and footprint. Those changes were to ensure that Ford in each of our regional auto businesses drive sustainable, profitable growth. Since announcing that plan, we've incurred $3.7 billion of EBIT charges, and $1.1 billion of related cash effects with the majority of them in 2019. Now I'll expand on our perspective on 2020. At a macro level, our guidance reflects our expectation for continued GDP growth globally and across our major markets. We also anticipate healthy industry volumes on an absolute basis, but down modestly from 2019, including declines in the US, Europe and China. This outlook does not factor in any assumptions for impacts from the Corona virus to our global business, as it is still a very fluid situation, and we're still assessing the magnitude and duration of potential impacts. For Ford, 2020 will be another heavy product launch year, as we continue to shift investments to our franchise strengths. For example, in 2020, 75% of North America's volume will be all-new or refreshed versus 2017. This is up from 40% in 2019, an increase of 35 points. Another way to slice this is by looking at the average ages of our vehicles in our portfolio. In the US, the average age will drop from 5.3 years in 2017 to 3.3 years in 2020, on our way to 2.9 years by 2023. After that, we plan to keep a stable and competitive product plan with fresh products every year. So looking at 2020 more closely, our launches include our new F-150, a new-to-the-lineup small off-road utility vehicle and Mustang Mach-E. We'll also launch our strongest lineup yet of electrified vehicles including HEV and PHEV versions of popular nameplates like Corsair, Kuga and F-150. At the same time, we'll ramp products introduced in 2019 like Explorer, Aviator, Kuga Escape, Puma Transit 2-Ton and Super Duty. In addition, late in the year, we will start production of our highly anticipated all new Bronco, with availability for customers in early 2021. As you consider our guidance, you should be mindful of several tailwinds and headwinds. For tailwinds, we expect full-year of sales of all new Explorer and improved product mix and pricing from other new products. Additional fitness and benefits from our global redesign and the non-repeat of the UAW bonuses. For headwinds, we expect the back-end loaded nature of our launch cadence, especially F-150, the cost of CO2 compliance, increased investments in mobility, lower EBT from Ford Credit largely driven by our assumptions for residual values, and the non-repeat of mark-to-market gains on derivatives, and a higher effective tax rate. All of these considerations contribute to our 2020 guidance for $2.4 billion to $3.4 billion and adjusted free cash flow. For adjusted EBIT, we're targeting a range of $5.6 billion to $6.6 billion which assumes at least nominal growth in Auto offset by lower EBT from Ford Credit and a modest investment increase in mobility. With an effective tax rate in the mid to high teens, our adjusted EPS range is $0.94 to $1.20 per share. In the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBIT to be down more than $1.1 billion from the first quarter 2019, driven by the continuation of higher warranty costs we experienced in the second half of 2019, lower volume, lower results from Ford Credit and higher investment for mobility. And we expect our effective tax rate in the quarter to be at the high end of our full year guidance range. Relative to calls on capital for the year, we expect capex to be $6.8 billion to $7.3 billion, as much as $800 million lower than in 2019, reflecting benefits from our fitness initiatives. Funded pension contributions of $0.6 billion to $0.8 billion and regular quarterly dividends of $0.15 per share as always subject to Board approval each quarter. For global redesign, we expect to incur $0.9 billion to $1.4 billion of EBIT special item charges with negative cash effects of $0.8 billion to $1.3 billion. Our guidance assumes no material change in the current economic environment including commodities, foreign exchange and tariffs. As a reminder, our guidance does not factor in assumptions for impact from the Corona virus as it is still a fluid situation. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those detailed in our filings with the SEC. We have a strong bias for action to improve our operating performance, to protect our investment grade rating and ensure a strong balance sheet. Specifically, our commitment to have entering recession, a cash balance of $20 billion and liquidity at $30 billion, to preserve our debt capacity and to sustain the fully funded and derisk status of our funded pension plans. All of our capital allocation decisions are made with these priorities front of mind, including funding our traditional products, and non-product investment plans. Our growth plans for electrification, mobility, connected services and autonomy and our regular dividend. Before we move to Q&A, there are few things I encourage you to keep in mind as you think about Ford, today and for the long term. First, our customers are informing and driving everything we do. That is why 2019 was and 2020 will be such robust product launch years for us. We are bolstering our winning portfolio of vehicles based on what our customers want and need, reallocating capital to those higher return growth opportunities and carrying out changeovers of our highest volume and most profitable vehicles. Second, we are determined to always get better to persistently improve our fitness and our operating execution. We have abundant opportunities across our business to drive free cash flow, along with long-term growth in revenue and profitability, including adjusted EBIT margins of 8% or better. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and holding investment grade credit ratings. And third, as I look ahead, I'm optimistic. We have many opportunities to improve our operational execution, drive growth, strengthen our financial results including cash flow, in the process earn the confidence of our stakeholders. Now, let's open the call for questions. Operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. John Murphy : Good evening guys. A first question. As we look at what you're working on right now, there is kind of two layers of rationalization, sort of, there is this near-term operational execution turnarounds that needs to occur and then there's the global redesign. And as we look at this, I mean you're staring down the barrel of great product launches or great products and you got to get those launches right, and products that have just launched. So, I mean in the near term, it just seems like you've got the product, the operational execution is just a real issue. I'm just curious, I mean we can all see that you're kind of identifying it but what really turns that around. And it's not - the products there, just trying to understand what really gets this operational execution turned in the near term hopefully. And then sort of as you look at the inflection point on the global redesign, is that the kind of thing that's going to hit in late 2020 or early 2021 because what you're indicating as far as the charges, looks like you'll be halfway through. So it's just, it seems like that inflection point is not going to come until 2021. It might still be a headwind in the near term. So in those two layers if you can kind of talk about the actions, you're taking near term and the inflection point on the global redesign. Jim Hackett : Thanks, John. Jim Hackett here. I think that's well said. I characterize it in the company that we're always managing the now and the far in parallel and they are synergistic, they feed each other. But they have totally different kind of requirements, right? So in the now, the message in the company is we work really hard to get the portfolio rationalized, communicated, we - just to remind you, we went to work really hard on the platform architectures underneath that whole portfolio. At the same time, we feathered in our connectivity. We're working on car architectures that power the vehicles. We're talking about proportion inside of them with electrification. So there is a lot in that - in that product turnaround. And the market, it's too early for me to tell you the new portfolio share improvements better than the old one. But the market is giving us really good signs there. It does boil down to, we can't miss a beat now in the product launches. Today, for example, I spent a lot of time with Joe and others are working through the F-150. So that's, that's the state and spirit in the company as we saw the mistakes, we X-rayed that deeply for you in the last call, so that you knew, we went to kind of went to the desert to get to the bottom of that. I have zero question that we have identified what's - what was at risk there, what bad decisions we made? What new things we have to change? That's all kind of in the rear view mirror and now it's about executing on the things that we've laid out this year. So that's my perspective from the product. Tim, maybe you can address the global redesign. The thing I just want to sneak in on the global redesign. This is - this has to happen in parallel. I give our people a lot of credit, because their day jobs of managing what I just laid out runs in parallel as they redesign the company and there is some really bright spots in that. For example, the Europe team has a lot of momentum right now, and you might mention that Tim in your summary of what's been going on there. Tim Stone : Yes, so from a redesign standpoint, we made, as Jim said, strong progress in 2019. And it's a highlight for the year. Europe, for example is carrying out strong execution of the redesign of its business, announced closure of six manufacturing facilities, eliminated a total of 12,000 positions, and focused on leadership and doubling down on that leadership in commercial vehicles and importing iconic nameplates as well as passenger vehicles. South America continued to move to lower cost asset-light footprint, including exiting the production of heavy trucks in San Bernardo as you know and discontinued Fiesta and Focus models. And for the year, we saw charges this year of $3.2 billion and total thus far of $3.7 billion. If you factor in the guidance, we're giving on restructuring charges to be at $4.6 billion to $5.1 billion through the end of '20 and from a cash standpoint through the end of '21, $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion. And I think the benefits of the redesign as well as the fitness are starting to show through. If you look at 2018, for example, structural costs were flat. 2019, structural costs were down year-over-year. So you're starting to see it reflected in the underlying fundamentals of our results. And as you suggested they continue to build over time as further actions are implemented. John Murphy : Okay, that's helpful. And then just a second question, just quickly on Europe and with the CO2 regs tightening this year, next year and going forward. I'm just curious, if you think with your current product portfolio and what you have in the works with the VW alliance that you'll be able to meet the requirements over there, or will you have to do some kind of pooling or pay fines over the next one to two years? And I mean do you think this is something you can solve in-house with product solution or you going to have to go out-house and you're pooling or pay fines? Jim Hackett : Yes, fair question. This has come up before, John, in previous quarters. But Joe, you might confirm. Joseph Hinrichs : Yes, John, good evening. So we do expect to be able to achieve the new CO2 requirements without incurring fines or purchasing credits. I just want to make that clear. It's a product-driven plan. We've known about these regulations for several years. They were first public back in 2012, 2013. We've been playing the business accordingly. Since then, by the end of 2020, we will have 14 new electrified offerings in the market in Europe. And by the end of '24, we expect to have 17 electrified vehicles including number of mild hybrids, plug-in hybrids, some full hybrids and then a call - including our electric models. So this also includes improvements in our diesel offerings and other products that are internal combustion engines as well. So we feel really good about the plan, we need to execute the launches on time to make sure that we get the products that we're planning to meet those, but our plan is definitely product-driven and we do not expect to incur any fines, have to pool with anybody else or purchase credits. Thanks. John Murphy : Great. And then just one just quick question on slide 14, Tim. This $500 million of negative cost, I mean that has the $600 million of the UAW cost and it's - so on a like-for-like basis, costs actually improved in the quarter. Would that be a fair way to read that? Tim Stone : Slide 15, you said? John Murphy : Slide 14 you have cost was a negative $0.5 billion. But I would imagine that's got the UAW contract of $600 million. Tim Stone : So, yes. On slide 14 in North America, UAW is included in other. John Murphy : Got it. Okay, all right, great, thank you very much. Jim Hackett : Thank you, John. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Great, thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you might be able to give us a little bit more color on your regional auto EBIT expectations for 2020. It seems like you would have a few pretty significant tailwinds set up, which don't really appear to be flowing into your 2020 EBIT guidance for Auto, which you said was up normally - nominally. I guess, essentially, I'm hoping that you can talk a little bit about the direction that you are expecting for each of the key markets. So, like North America obviously, non-recur of the Explorer launch issues and UAW bonus, which are collectively pretty big, is that offset by the - completely offset by the F-Series launch and other items? And in Europe, I think Joe Hinrichs, you said that most of the 12,000 people that you had commented on leaving were still on the payroll through the end of last year and would have a bigger impact this year. Are those just swamped by the CO2 compliance costs? Jim Hackett : So Rod, it's good to hear from you, it's Jim. You know there is not a point tonight where we're going to go market by market. We just don't do that for obvious competitive reasons, but let's just repeat what is in, what color is in the guidance we've given. Joseph Hinrichs : Great. I'll take that, Jim, thanks. So as we said, at least nominal growth in Auto. Jim just said, we are not going to spread that around by region. With Ford Credit being lower, you may have heard in the call, we expect the auction values to be down 5% year-over-year - compared with 2%, sorry in 2019, big driver there, and then increasing investments mobility. As we saw in 2019, $0.5 billion increase for example in mobility investment. So that's the primary color we are providing on the different segments as opposed to the regions. We also - I can go through the headwinds and tailwinds for you, but they're not to be underestimated that the headwinds, for example, of 2020 launches late in the year F-150 for example, CO2 costs, mobility as I just mentioned, Ford Credit as I just mentioned and then tax rate up to mid to high teens compared to 11% in 2019. Those are the primary headwinds. Tailwinds, we certainly have a full year benefit of the sale of the Explorer, for example, as well as mix and price of new products, and then as I mentioned in the earlier question, the benefits of fitness and the global redesign and of course the non-recurrence of UAW, it's about a $0.6 billion impact. Rod Lache : Yes, thanks for that. Did you just say that the mobility investments would be up $0.5 billion in 2020? Joseph Hinrichs : No, I was - thanks for asking. I was saying they were up in 2019 by $0.5 billion, and 2020 they will be up, we are not giving the magnitude. Rod Lache : Yes. Look, I'm sure you - I mean there are reasons to not provide color on the regional numbers. But from an external standpoint, you start adding up maybe a $1 billion tailwind from explorer and $600 million from UAW and certainly more than $1 billion from this head count in Europe and big plant closure in South America, it's - those - not quantifying that is, it makes it very challenging for us to really assess what you're, what you're facing and what's in there. Do you have an assumption in there for a further increase in warranty costs this year? Tim Stone : Yes, it will potentially only add to your comment you just made, but I think we took a step forward this quarter in providing a segment level commentary connected with the cash flow and EBIT guidance that we gave, in addition to not providing regional commentary. We're not speaking to specific attributes from a cost standpoint, such as warranty and so forth. Rod Lache : Okay. And maybe just lastly, you talked about that $7 billion of cash spending on restructuring, the number has been quite low. I think lower than you had originally anticipated in 2019, and it's only up a bit in 2020. Presumably some of the cost savings are kind of tied to the cash restructuring rather than the headline GAAP charges. Could you just give us some color on what's going on there and changing the timing? And whether we should be reading into the trajectory of the turnaround plan based on that? Tim Stone : Yes. I think slide 20 illustrates the $11 billion in charges and $7 billion and how we're progressing against that $3.7 billion thus far, as I mentioned we factored in the guidance for 2020 would be $4.6 billion to $5.1 billion, potential actions that we are still considering there. The [ph] cash standpoint, $1.1 billion thus far and with the guidance we gave $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion. As far as the calendarization of that, we still have several years to continue to execute. I mean on the global redesign, we don't have a new announcement to make today. But I think one of the things we are seeing in the cash savings, cash side, sorry the saving, the team has been especially thoughtful about how we execute on the restructuring actions in Europe and in South America, for example, and taking every opportunity to save cash in the process. Rod Lache : Just to clarify; Tim, are you suggesting that the number or the cash number may be lower than the $7 billion, or that it would just be more spread out? Tim Stone : I was addressing the next question about - apologies. I was addressing the question as to why we made them lower that you might have been expecting through 2020. The number is still $11 billion and $7 billion over\u2026 Rod Lache : Okay, all right, thank you. Jim Hackett : Thank you, Rod. They are over-performing, which is a good thing. That's kind of in the reviews, I've been really impressive, particularly in Europe, as we said. Operator : All right. Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Thanks. Good evening, everyone. I'll first echo Rod's comments and about transparency because they really, it really would be helpful. And we understand that you won't be, you can't know with 100% certainty these items and, but we are certainly used to management teams, given their best guess, particularly at a time when there is so much pressure, and when the stakes are so high. So just to say, good on Rod for zoning in on that. First question for me is Tesla, stocks worth. It's kind of historic day as Tesla is now worth over 5 times the market cap of Ford. Jim or Tim or Joe, can you guys understand, can you, are you sympathetic to why that is that state of the world, does it make sense to you. What's the message the market is sending Ford Motor Company? Jim Hackett : Adam, it's good to hear from you. And the first comment on transparency did not bounce off the atmosphere. I do understand that in this transformation of Ford, the from-to kind of calculus isn't always apparent. For example, consider we've got a portfolio that is in the midst of some things are sunsetting and all these new things are coming out and you, you want to know what can we project in terms of your earnings performance. And it's my instincts that back when we first started talking together that this is going to make a much better Ford and in fact, I mean now, I am now more certain of that. What I didn't count on and we're going to address of course is that we can't fumble execution because we, the value of Explorer launch back in our year is a different kind of story about Ford. So, that's just to confirm that we are doing our best to try and teach you about where we are in the transformation. But it's my confidence that you're going to be happy with that. Now the thing about Tesla is CEOs don't ever talk from this table about competitors. But I have been really candid in the company since I came about what is the business model that's there and what frankly about is attractive? And what you can see in Ford's commitment. I'm really proud of the team here as we arrived in June '17, the propulsion strategy was kind of nil and we got that squared away. We have 17 new hybrid and all-electric models across the entire lineup. So picture that Ford's in a position where it's got a portfolio of products for its customers, including a bigger extensive offering than the other guy. But the key component of this is the need to have these vehicles connected and over the air communications and the kind of configuration that one can bring to the customers. We already know that the kind of volume we're going to have in car years usage by 2025 will be over 100 million car years of usage of data, so just let that sink in. And that's what, that's what the market sees right, in the future of the car industry, that there is this kind of opportunity for expansion and growth. But I haven't forecasted that in tonight's discussion. It's not, it's because we got to prove that we can get this done, and get it, get it to produce the kind of results that you're seeing there. But I think we're much further along in that journey than we were just two years ago when you and I first started talking about it. How do I know that this Mach-E has generated more attention and kind of interest than in recent memory of any kind of product? The kind of searching that's going on about Bronco would amaze you. And so I know that it is really high, given the execution and the kind of improvements that I just mentioned. So let me, let you react to that. Adam Jonas : Thank you. No, that's fine, Jim and I think it's - I appreciate the thoughts and I can't wait to get my Mach-E and my kids really can't wait to see the Mach-E in the garage. One follow-up for me, Jim regarding Volkswagen. Is there any limit to the level of collaboration that you can conceive between you and VW? I'm just I'm wondering if there's anything that's theoretically off limits between the two houses during a really historic kind of tectonic time for the industry where it seems like global major OEMs are forming super groups. I'm just wondering, if there is anything off limits here. Thanks. Jim Hackett : Yes. Well, thank you for ordering the Mach-E. I got to tease you, I just ordered mine last week. I want the world to know I waited. I want to get in the middle of it. I didn't want to be first in line and went really well and they said that I'm right behind Adam Jonas... Adam Jonas : I'm probably high on the list than you, but I reckon you will still get it before me. But\u2026 Jim Hackett : No, no, that's not the deal, I want to live it. But thank you. VW, so yes I'm proud of in the repetition of the good things that happened last year, how well that came together in kind of an early phasing of what you are now witnessing and the commentary that we made in the opening was that, you don't have to combine Human Resource departments to get the kind of value in the automotive industry that we think we can, we can get arrangements like that. So, I want you to see the optimism that and hear the optimism in my voice that we're open to lots of ideas there. And I want to also stress that Mahindra similarly is proving to us that in emerging in emerged markets, it really is expanding the power of Ford. So right now the plate is full though with the things that we've committed to each other. Those two companies and Ford, we really got a lot going on, and I want to see the conclusion of that before I start adding a lot more to the plate. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Jim. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Hi, good evening, and thanks for taking the questions. First question, your dividend is a $2.4 billion commitment annually. Obviously, we've seen some profit compression and you do still have to fund your restructuring. So it just means that the dividend right now is being funded by the balance sheet. Could you just talk to the rationale of maintaining the dividend at this level? And what are the threshold and business conditions for you to maintain it? Jim Hackett : Well, we would like to return value to shareholders. I know that's a really bad answer, but it's true and the dividend has been legendary value creator at Ford. We are really responsible about the way like you say that you think about the use of the balance sheet to fund that. A year ago on this call, I made it clear that my objective and the way I was thinking about all the things coming in front of us is I want to continue to pay the dividend, I wanted to be able to fund the restructuring and make all the investments in the future. You know that those - the balance, all of those interest was behind the business plan that has rolled out. And so I want to continue that because we said we could do it. And right now we can. And Tim, I don't know if you want to add anything. Tim Stone : No, that's well said. And that's one of the reasons why we look at our targeted cash and liquidity positions, we established those targets of $20 billion and $30 billion, which were $22 billion and $35 billion now, heading into a downturn. So it could be in a position to invest in our long-term investment, the customer experience and fund the dividend for shareholders. Dan Levy : So I guess that the view is that the liquidity, you have plus the stream of cash flow that you do have you still feel comfortable enough with this level to maintain the dividend. That's a fair assessment? Tim Stone : That's right. That's why we gave the guidance for the $0.15 per share dividend, throughout this year per quarter. Dan Levy : Got it. Great, thank you. And then just as a follow-up, I think, a year ago you disclosed that your global truck, van EBIT margin was 14% in 2018. I think actually it's maybe a little higher when you strip out the corporate costs. So as we think about the deterioration in 2019. And what was the likely deterioration in '20, help us maybe understand if we look back at the profit pools, would you say that the truck margin has remained intact and that it's really deterioration in other parts of the business or has that truck margin deteriorated as well? Jim Hackett : I am going to ask Joe to answer that, because this is a primarily North American kind of question as well. So Joe. Joseph Hinrichs : Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Dan. I mean, first off, we're very pleased with where we are with our F-Series and Ranger here in North America and the range of performance in places like Europe and other places around the world. Without getting into specifics of the margins in 2019, we're - I also will say that our pricing, transaction prices, incentive levels relative to the competition, and our overall sales volume were all very good in 2019 here in the US and so we feel very pleased with our progress going into a year when we have a new F-150. We had a new Super Duty at the end of last year. So we're not worried at all about where our competitive position is on our F-Series trucks. In fact, we're really excited about the new trucks that we have coming this year. And if you know that the cycle times of where things are, we get the benefit of a new truck after seeing what GM and Ram have done and actually held on very strongly to our volume and our pricing. If you look at the pricing specifically, we continue to have the highest transaction prices in the segment with the oldest truck on F-series, F-150 specifically and adding Ranger to the portfolio just added to the business, and in fact gave us the largest pickup volume in the US last year of all manufacturers combined, so - or all manufacturers that we compete with. So we feel really good about where we are on the F-Series. As Jim mentioned, we feel really good about where we are right at this point in time and the launch was coming up in the second half of the year on F-150. So we're not - F-150 and F-Series is of course the crown jewels of our company and we feel really good about where they are competitively and where they are from a profit standpoint. Dan Levy : Great, thank you. Operator : And our final - our last question will come from the line of Joseph Spak, RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thank you. The first question is, maybe just a clarification, Tim, you mentioned mobility investment up modestly, is that apples-to-apples, because aren't you de-consolidating Argo in 2020? So shouldn't that help with your share of the loss being lower? Tim Stone : Yes. So again in 2019, mobility investment was up $0.5 billion and explaining our range of EBIT guidance for 2020, along with - at least normal growth in Auto and Credit being lower, now we are saying mobility investments to be up again year-over-year, we are not quantifying the amount. We will be de-consolidating Argo when that transaction closes. As a reminder, that's the self-driving system only, the SDS. The go-to market and other aspects of that as far as vehicle customer value proposition is separate level of investment. We're taking a very prudent approach to it. Joseph Spak : Okay. But just to clarify then, the - should we expect to see the mobility loss higher in '20 even with the de-consolidation. Tim Stone : Correct. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then, just maybe a follow-on to Adam's question earlier. And I guess, in the spirit of disrupting yourself from within Jim. I think it's something you mentioned to me once, now that you have some units coming through in '20 and '21, is there any thought to actually just taking and separating out all the electric assets, the Mach-E, the MEB and Rivian derivatives and break that out as like a Ford E similar to what you've done in mobility to sort of help show us that transition? Jim Hackett : Joe, it's an interesting thought. I'm actually going the other way emotionally, which is I don't think the company can keep itself like of straddling in an old world and a new world forever, it kind of confuses the organization. And so in some of the challenges that I have on mind to do this, I have a friend in the business who said, he carries around a card with what are the toughest conversations and issues that he has got to address and no one really wants to deal with. From my perspective, the transformation has to accelerate and so I don't want to do anything that makes the organization feel like we can park it on the side. And if it does well and grows up it gets attention, but if it doesn't, we didn't really integrate it and so I have stronger instincts the other way. But I understand your question also in terms of, can we do something to prove that our transformation, and our strategy is actually accelerating. And I get that; I would like to take that away is something that we, that we ought to do is try and show you how the compounding of our new ideas are actually taking off. That's the confidence I want you have tonight is that, that I am seeing them, it's just not material enough to move the needle. And that's what I want you to get the confidence, that is - it will move the needle and it will have impact. Joseph Spak : Okay. And maybe if I could just squeeze one more in. The $7 billion cash restructuring, you've only spent a little bit, it looks like you've spent a little bit over $2 billion through 2020. I understand that sort of comes when you could sort of make announcements, but should we think that that remaining just under $5 billion will be done by '21 or is that also pushed out versus prior thinking? Tim Stone : Yes. As far as the time frame on that as you said, $1.9 million to $2.4 billion through the end of '20, of the $7 billion and beyond that, we haven't given specific timelines or calendarization over the next several years. We'll update everyone as we have more information. Joseph Spak : Okay, thank you. Operator : And that's all the time we have for questions. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Hackett. Jim Hackett : Thank you. And tonight, you know our slide started with a picture of the Mach-E. And I was inspired by the picture as I waited for you to ask questions. This product that's on that slide lives in great respect for the Ford legacy, but as it respects, it's not in reverence. It's not in such reverence so that it can change. But this vehicle is an iconic example of what we've been working on, the company has to change. It's changing its portfolio, it's restructuring markets like Europe and South America. Europe hadn't been touched for years. It's taking on the bureaucracy. We cut it by a third, $700 million likely in run rate savings. We mandated connectivity, which was a multi-billion dollar commitment before we had the kind of software to run on this. We build agile team, that's how this vehicle was created. And then there is an obvious question as you look at that and I look at that is can we execute and of course, we can. We will promise that we will earn your trust in that area. And I don't want you to think that we have to struggle on the way to the future, we are not going to cancel the future because of the focus on earnings. We think these - the improvement in earnings that we all want and the requirement that we have to get to our future can live in a synergistic way and build the kind of excitement in Ford Motor Company that you heard Adam and I talking about tonight. So, thank you for your time on the call. Operator : This concludes the Ford Motor Company fourth quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Holly, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn? Lynn Tyson : Thank you, Holly. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company's [first] quarter earnings call. Consistent with social distancing, speakers today are connected from different location, so in advance I appreciate your patience in putting any latency as we answer questions. I also personally hope that you and all of your loved ones are safe. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; Jim Farley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit. Jim Hackett, will begin with a brief review of our results and how we are putting people first through this pandemic including our team members, customers and partners. Jim Farley, will cover the operational excellence required to execute solutions while ensuring Ford comes out of this even stronger. And Tim will talk about the prudent and proactive actions we are taking to enhance our cash position while preserving the financial flexibility to fund our redesign and growth initiatives including critical launches. Then we'll turn the call to Q&A and Jim will close with a few remarks. Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on slide 23 of our deck. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year, company EBIT, EPS and operating cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume weighted basis. Now let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett. Jim Hackett : Thanks Lynn, and hello everyone. And Lynn let me thank you for doing an incredible job in putting this virtual call together. In addition to Jim Farley, our Chief Operating Officer; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer, I'm proud to say that Rudy and Ozzie, my two big girls are joining me today in the call. Well, you know, the nature of times brings to mind the notion of paradox. And I like to think of the definition of a paradox as two truths that compete. Let me explain. The first truth is that safety is of the utmost concern in a pandemic; yours, your loved ones' and the people you work with. The communities you live in and amazingly all other humans you interact with, their safety guarantees your safety. The second truth, there is no future if we don't have an economic system that is always on. We didn't realize there was an off switch. We knew it might go into a recession more like a dimmer switch, but off. Well now as we bring these two truths together, they compete. Turning the economy back on challenges the question of whether it is safe enough. My goal today is to provide an update on where Ford stands and hopefully illustrate that Ford is doing a great job of managing this paradox and confirm that we have control of the business in a very difficult time. I am pleased to report to you that we have the foresight to move early, ahead of the shutdown. We kicked off our coronavirus response task force led by about 30 senior leaders from across the company. Independent of virus we call we had around the same time, reorganized our top team, enabled by a new Chief Operating officer position held by Jim Farley. Candidly, this now looks quite prescient as Jim in his new role, was able to quickly marshal our operating team to focus quickly on the most important actions. Minutes that led to hours made a huge difference in our responsiveness. We went from a 1,000 people who work remotely from home to more than 60,000. And we've had terrific productivity in the face of this unforeseen challenge, including our team in China which preceded the economic closure around the world. Jim, will talk more about that in a moment. Now, as we approach this challenge, we laid out three clear priorities underpinned by what we would say are Ford values. The first, undeniably, we have to protect the safety of our people, and do our part to limit the spread of the virus. Second, to leverage our knowledge and capability to deliver critical supplies to frontline workers and patients, while taking care of customers, dealers and communities in which we live. And three, skillfully manage our business through the crisis, safeguarding what we believe is a very bright future for Ford Motor Company. I have found it is true, that Ford people are at their best in tough times. It was true when Ford was building aircraft and arms that formed the arsenal of democracy in World War Two. And it was true just a short decade ago when we rallied to avoid bankruptcy, and a government bailout. And we emerged from the great recession a stronger company. I want to confirm it's certainly been true today. Let me take you through a bit more detail on those three priorities. As I said, the first priority was to protect our people, and do our part to limit the spread of this virus. So in mid-March, we were among the earliest company - the early companies to instruct the vast majority of our employees to work remotely. We also partnered with the UAW and other automakers to introduce new safety protections in our factories and warehouses, and then to shut down those facilities worldwide. In an illustration of the art of a global pandemic, these actions were taken even as we were cautiously restarting operations with our joint venture partners in China. Sadly though, in the face of this, Ford has not been immune from the ravages of the virus, we've lost 11 colleagues in the U.S. and the UK to this pandemic. Our second priority was to leverage our knowledge and capability to deliver critical supplies to frontline workers and patients. I couldn't have been more proud of our organization. The bottom line though, is when society needs you, we answer the call. In this case, we're doing that in many countries that Ford calls its own. Ford has always been a family business from the generations of leadership to the generations of the proud employees. And with that, we believe comes a special responsibility to take care of each other and this pandemic, of course is no different, in fact, it requires that in spades. We know this devastating crisis will come to an end. But in the meanwhile, we're doing everything we can to help. As we suspended a large portion of our work on designing and building great vehicles, we rally to begin producing vitally needed personal protection and medical equipment. Around the globe, our people, including the UAW partners, as I said, amaze me every day as they engineer and produce hundreds of ambulances and are up to 100,000 respirators for healthcare professionals with 3M. More than 8 million face shields so far. 50,000 patient ventilators with GE Healthcare. And about 1 million face masks, more like surgical masks every day. And up to now 100,000 washable isolation gowns per week with Joyson Safety Systems. Putting people first also means though taking care of our customers. We announced we find payments on new vehicles and a better online experience for customers. No contact vehicle delivery and service including disinfected products. And roadside and other services through the FordPass app. We also worked quickly to take care of our dealers with digital marketing, sales and service tools and advice on managing liquidity as you know, the government instituted a program that dealers could qualify for to enable them to keep their organizations intact, and taking care of our communities with millions of dollars in contributions of vehicles in cash. The third priority which will be the bulk of our call today was to skillfully manage our business through the crisis. One of the rallying cries rushed through all of this just as it was in '08 and '09, is not that - is that we must not only weather the crisis, we need to emerge from it ready to build a brighter future. So yes, as even though we took measures to preserve cash, we are moving forward on our creating tomorrow together plan, you're going to ask me about that. And we're totally committed to it. This is going to leverage fresh new portfolio of vehicles, a commitment to autonomy and electrification, along with connectivity, global partnerships that look precious as well that they started before this pandemic. And they're going to serve service in the future, including Rivian because we've gotten questions about that, and a better customer experience. In a moment, Jim Farley will provide more detail on the progress we're making in our underlying business during the crisis. I'm really proud of him and he's just worked around the clock frankly. And so to say it has been a 24/7 effort is not an exaggeration. At the same time, we're pulling every appropriate lever to protect our core business. Strengthen the balance sheet, Tim Stone, also working around the clock to make sure that the company lead in this initiative and bolster our cash to optimize our financial flexibility. I'm proud that we have that all in place before the first quarter was over. Part of skillfully managing through this crisis is having a well thought out protocol though, for back to work. And we did this for China. And I'm pleased that earlier today we announced we'll restart our European manufacturing production, with enhanced employee protection protocols in place. Is taking a phased approach starting on May 4. We will restart vehicle and the engine production at most of our sites in continental Europe. And there'll be a gradual ramp up over the next few months before full production is resumed globally. Well still, there's no denying the negative economic consequences of a pandemic. In the first quarter, our adjusted free cash flow was negative by $2.2 billion. Revenue amazingly was still $34 billion and we incurred of course an EBIT loss of around $0.6 billion. In fact, heading toward the middle of the quarter, listen to this, we were on track to meet or exceed our original guidance for adjusted EBIT in the quarter. Well, as I said earlier, be assured that everyone at Ford is squarely focused on both today, and in our future. We believe it remains bright. And it is a great source of motivation for us as we serve that future and of course, take care of all these immediate needs. Right now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim Farley. Jim? Jim Farley : Thanks, Jim. Operational excellence especially in this crisis requires, obviously the dedication, but also collaboration, partnership and support from the entire enterprise, our suppliers, our dealers, employees, unions, our JV partners, and our execution. And its excellence demonstrated this early on in China as Jim said. I know we're going to come out of this a lot stronger. But we need to be agile, have a bias towards action and be very transparent with our employees, our customers and partners. Early on in China, we focused on business continuity. We mapped our suppliers for the liquidity in the supply chain. We created a unique logistics portal to track our supply chain. We secured air freight capacity to deliver critical safety equipment to our team in China importantly including our dealers. And we used the same air capacity to ensure of supply of critical parts to regions like North America outside of China. We then partnered closely with our dealers. We retract in-store traffic, inventory, the financial liquidity and health. And in the face of shuttering our dealerships, we turn together work together to drive demand and ensure quality service to our customers. We provided those customers with a more robust app to order vehicles online. In fact, in China today, over a third of our sales are now direct online. We increased doorstep delivery of sanitized vehicles with what we call zero touch. We currently expanded to schedule remote service and vehicle pickup for maintenance and make it easy for customers. And our joint venture partners were up and running as early as February 10. In fact, as Jim said, one of them JMC repurposed our two ton transit van to manufacture over 1500 Ford Transit ambulances in the first quarter. From the start, we focused on a return to work protocol for our Chinese business. And that involved governance like reworking manufacturing safety requirements and restructuring a lot of jobs inside our facilities to ensure we can protect distancing. This protocol is being extended to Europe, and will also be used when we restart our operations around the world. We call it our playbook. In addition to those accomplishments, our China team also quickly honed in our cost. In the face of significant demand disruption Ford China delivered year-over-year improvements in both contribution and structural costs. Actually, they got close to their initial EBIT targets for the quarter, offsetting all the COVID impacts. The actions we took in China became best practice for us. Part of our playbook as we tackle the virus globally protecting our people, and limiting the spread of the virus as Jim described. I've been in the industry 30 years, I've been in Ford 13. I've seen a lot of wonderful leadership, especially in '08 and '09, but I have never seen what's happened at Ford over the last weeks. Countless acts of leadership throughout every level of the organization, replicated and added to the success we\u2019ve realized in China. Power Ford, it is in our DNA. And we\u2019re proud to share it with that capabilities to many other people. The stark reality of a protracted global shut down of our sector and our vertical has forced a laser focus on cost and liquidity. And just as we did in China, we've ratcheted it down spending across the board, both fixed and variable. To ensure we come out of this stronger, we protected our cycle plan, our launches and our technology roadmaps including connectivity. We believe this pandemic could affect our customers live and work for many years to come with the zero touch now as an integral part of their lives going forward, perhaps spurring on even more interest in adoption of autonomy, especially goods delivery, and micro mobility. While effects of the virus may cause some shifts in timing, we are really excited about our forthcoming launch of the redesigned F-150. It is the anchor of our F series brand. It is America's Best Selling Vehicle for 43 years, and the launch will feature the first ever hybrid electric F-150. We're also revealing a new Bronco brand. We\u2019re going to continue our launch of 30 market specific Ford and Lincoln vehicles in China over the next three years 10 of which will be electric. We're going to offer electrified versions of the Lincoln Corsair, and the Ford Escape and Kuga, which is now in launch in China and in Europe. We're going to continue preparations for the much anticipated return of the legendary Ford Bronco next year. And shortly after I began my new role in February, I did a two day deep dive with the automotive leadership team, where we really grow. And how we were going to address the task and opportunities ahead. And from the start, I was not only impressed of the diversity of skills and knowledge of our team, but the look in their eye and desire and accountability to take on those opportunities and move the company forward. Together we came up as a simple frame. We have a few things to fix and accelerate, and we need a growth plan for the company. The recent challenges presented by the virus have just amplified our commitment to these three areas. There is no grace period for transforming Ford. Two weeks ago, we announced a reorganization that will allow us to better execute against those things that we need to fix and accelerate and to establish our growth initiatives. We empowered a talented and diverse group of leaders from inside but also from outside of Ford to drive transformation into high growth, high margin businesses. Among the changes, Kumar Galhotra, who has been President in North America will take on expanded role for South America and ING markets as well. Lisa Drake, a seasoned Executive in our industrial system, was named Chief Operating Officer for North America and remains Vice President of Global Purchasing. She will be laser focused on our launches, our cost and our industrial system in North America. Gil Gur Arie, who has distinguished career in the Israeli Military Intelligence Core has joined Ford as Chief Global Data Insights and Analytics. And Ted Cannis whose team developed the revolutionary Mustang Mach-E, and the F-150 battery electric was appointed General Manager Commercial Vehicles. Now these leadership changes were specifically aimed at sharpening our focus on product and launch execution, fully leveraging smart connected vehicles and big data to serve our customers and the company, to improve our quality and lower our costs and creating a dedicated commercial vehicle business in the US and Canada. I'm confident this new structure will facilitate a much faster enterprise decision making and further efficiencies. I want to assure you that the same commitment and excellence we displayed to overcome COVID-19 are what we are leveraging, as we bring Ford's manufacturing and salary population back online, and turn our attention towards launching those incredible new Ford's and our winning portfolio. Over to Tim. Tim Stone : Thanks, Jim. It is just over a year since I came to Ford. The primary reason I joined was my belief that company has abundant opportunities to improve customer experience, enhance effectiveness, grow and create superior value for stakeholders. Being a part of this team, as we've tackled the crisis, has further strengthened my confidence in our team and in Ford's future. That's why throughout our comments on this call, even amid what we're doing to protect people from the virus and help stop its spread, our actions have been consistent with the priorities we've discussed with you for several quarters. First, improving customer experience and operational execution. Second, progressing our global redesign, making tough choices to lay the foundation for improvement in future automotive growth, free cash flow, profitability, and returns on capital. Third, enhancing fitness, through structural costs and capital efficiency and alliances that can drive durable scale benefits. Fourth, prioritizing meaningful opportunities for profitable long term growth in mobility. And fifth, employing continued discipline to drive strong results from Ford Credit. In the first quarter, lower industry volumes across all regions contributed to a 21% decline in wholesale and a 15% decrease in revenue. These results largely drove an adjusted EBIT loss of $0.6 billion and a negative $2.2 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Our results were constrained by the adverse impacts of the virus. We estimate the unfavorable impact to adjusted EBIT was at least $2 billion. In our automotive business, lower volume accounted for $177 million loss in EBIT as $346 million positive EBIT from North America was more than offset by losses in other markets. To be helpful and informed by your input, slide 10 of our deck includes additional color on the drivers of the year-over-year change in EBIT, putting warranty, which is higher by $0.5 billion, and structural costs, which is lower by $0.3 billion. Looking at the business in more detail provides some color on why, up until the middle of the quarter, we were on track to meet or exceed our initial EBIT guidance for the first quarter. Supported by improved product mix and the benefits of our global redesign. In North America, while top and bottom line metrics were negatively affected by the decline in units, both revenue and EBIT did benefit from better mix, especially F Series and Explorer. This improvement reflects our more disciplined approach to capital allocation, which is focused on investments around the globe on our franchise strengths. This includes our upcoming launches of our all new F-150 and three products that are new to the market, a small rugged off road utility, Mustang Mach-E, and Bronco. We will be able to update you on launch timing once we have a better understanding of our operational readiness as we bring our manufacturing back up. EBIT was also negatively affected year-over-year by increased warranty costs as we roll forward higher flow rates from the second half of last year. We also absorbed higher material costs for new models during the quarter. In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 13% and 21% respectively. In addition to the lower volume, revenue also influenced by weaker currencies, which are only partially offset by higher net pricing. Importantly, we narrowed our EBIT loss in the region to $0.1 billion, a 29% year-over-year improvement and our strongest performance since 2013. EBIT results do favorably reflect benefits from our global redesign, including exiting heavy truck production, discontinuing certain passenger vehicles and reducing headcount as we migrate to a lower cost asset light footprint. In Europe, wholesales and revenue were down 25% and 16% respectively. In addition to the virus, wholesales are also weighed down by the timing of our all new Kuga, which follows a normal launch curve. We\u2019re also absorbing the effects of our decision to discontinue low margin products. As we focus our portfolio on industry leading commercial vehicle, a more selective range of passenger vehicles and selected imports. All new vehicles this year include Kuga, Puma and Explorer SUVs which together will drive an increase in our mix of SUVs year-over-year. The decline in volume also reduced EBIT, which was down $4.2 billion year-over-year. As expected, the region absorbs higher material costs to support compliance with new CO2 regulations. The favorable shifts in our European product portfolio, which we expect to continue once we restart production, supported higher net pricing, and the benefits of global redesign actions continue to drive down structural costs. We're on track to complete the balance of our headcount reductions, by 10,000 at year end. China was at the forefront of the crisis. Our team did a great job mitigating the negative effects of the virus on our customers, other stakeholders and on our business results. Wholesales and revenue were down about 30%. New product launches, including Escape and Corsair and faster improvement in sales relative to the market contributed to a 10 basis point improvement in share to 2.2%. Explorer and Aviator are on track to launch this year and should be important additions to our China portfolio. Our China EBIT loss of $0.2 billion was down $0.1 billion year-over-year, as lower volume and adverse exchange are partially offset by improvement in structural cost. Losses on mobility continued to reflect strategic investments in future growth opportunities in mobility services and vehicle business model development for our autonomous vehicle platform. Ford Credit delivered EBT of $30 million in the quarter, down $771 million year-over-year. Portfolio performance is strong in the first quarter and delinquencies and charge offs remain at low levels. However, the results include COVID-19 related accruals of about $700 million, the most significant of which is for future credit losses, as well as lower auction values for off lease units awaiting sale at auction. Lease share remains below industry average and off lease auction values performed better than expected, up 1% year-over-year, and up 2% sequentially. At present most vehicle auctions in the U.S. are closed. Sales volume is very low, and prices are disrupting. As vehicle auctions reopen, we expect market prices to be disrupted for some period. And it is difficult to say how badly or for how many months. However, we do expect used vehicle markets to normalize over time. Managed receivables of $147 billion at quarter end were $9 billion lower year-over-year and $5 billion lower at year end. At the end of the first quarter, Ford Credit had $28 billion in liquidity, which remains above target. And Ford Credit has access to diverse funding sources to continue providing financing in the future. Ford Credit balance sheet is strong with ample liquidity. And importantly, its funding structure is self-liquidating. This means the Ford Credit generates liquidity, which reduces its funding requirements as balance sheet shrinks with lower automotive sales. Ford Credit is an important source of support for customers and dealers during this crisis. And Ford Credit remains an important strategic asset. Now let me turn to automotive liquidity and provide a little more color on some of the strategic actions we've taken since March, to provide additional flexibility during this challenging time. In March, we suspended our regular dividend, which equates to $2.4 billion per year. We also suspended our anti-dilutive share repurchase program, which was S0.2 billion last year. At the same time, we drew down over $15 billion under our corporate and supplemental credit facilities to bring cash on the balance sheet and provide greater certainty. Finally, last week, we completed an $8 billion opportunistic unsecured issuance to further improve our cash and liquidity profile, while most of our global operations remain shut down. As of April 24, our cash balance is strong at $35 billion. An amount we believe is sufficient to take us through at year end with no additional wholesale. Our plan though, as we announced today about Europe is to begin to phased restart in the second quarter as we plan to have wholesale much sooner than the end of the year. Relative to working capital, just like most other OEMs, there are two phases of cash outflow after a halt in production. For us, this began in late March. The first phase is more severe, is driven by about a 45 day run off in supplier payables. We have about $13 billion of production supplier payables after a late March production suspension, which will run off by early May. While this number can move around during the year, depending on scheduled plant shutdowns and other factors, it is a good approximation of that production payable number. The second phase is post runoff. After production payables have been extinguished. Once this happens, our cash outflow drops substantially, our ongoing payments, which are fairly consistent, include structural costs and warranty and vehicle incentive payments. Once production starts, there's an inherent cash flow leverage. Once you've been modest wholesale resume, our cash flow dynamics will improve, driven by the restoration of supplier payables if the large part immediate payment of vehicles upon wholesale. We're also thoroughly assessing and aggressively addressing our operations and looking for opportunities to preserve cash, lower operating costs, improve fitness, and drive our business to amplify our long-term potential. These include reductions of capital spending, deferring or eliminating non-essential expenditures across our business and deferring executive compensation. The incremental cash from these and other actions provide additional flexibility as we navigate this challenging environment. For example, this year we expect CapEx to be $6.3 billion to $6.8 billion down by about $0.5 billion compared with our February guidance and $0.8 billion to $1.3 billion lower than last year. Turning to our outlook, in mid-March, we withdrew our financial guidance for 2020. As a reminder, when we gave you our outlook in early February, we said it excluded impacts of COVID-19. Today, unfortunately, the economic environment remains too uncertain to provide updated guidance for the year. However, assuming in the second quarter, we restart production in a phased way. We believe we will see the largest impact from this crisis in the second quarter as industry volumes continue to be down significantly in every region year-over-year. As a result, we believe in just a second quarter EBIT will be a loss of more than $5 billion. The recovery actions we've taken and are working on are in the billions. But we know we will not be able to recover everything or make up all of the last volume. Lower industry volume will be our biggest headwind this year and any mix in net pressing benefit, we may realize from our global focus on franchise strengths, including exiting lower margin products fully impact of Explorer launched in 2019 and new launches such as F-150, slated for later this year, will be overshadowed by the negative impact of lower industry volume. Relative to structural costs, we expect favorability year-over-year was driven by actions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and our ongoing business actions. Before we turn over to QA, let me close with. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet, and doing what is right to preserve our future which is why we've been proactive in charting our course in maximizing liquidity during this uniquely uncertain time. Our recent actions provide flexibility to weather the present disruptions caused by COVID-19 and the confidence to continue to invest in growth opportunities. We have a strong bias reaction to improve our customer experience, operational execution and drive our financial performance, including free cash flow generation over time. I'm optimistic we will better position than ever on the other side of this to achieve our long term potential. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America. John Murphy : Good evening, everybody. It is really great to hear from all of you. It is going to be tough to stick to one question, but I will. Typically, out of a very tough time like this, you get a very good recovery, these a lot of the lessons learned in the tough time result in sort of real efficiency and focus. I'm just curious, I mean, Jim, you were talking this and Tim, you're talking about this on the balance sheet side, just curious if you can really illustrate or explain any of those opportunities you're seeing here in the near turn, specifically and because of going through this rolling restart with China and in Europe and North America being you're seeing some of these opportunities ready? If you can give us more details around us so we can understand that because traditionally 1 to 3 years out your margins are significantly higher in some cases. In the past recession they were an all-time highs three years after that we hit the skids in '09? So just trying to understand what you're seeing right now what the opportunities are in China, Europe and ultimately in North America? Jim Hackett : Thank you, John, Jim Hackett. I'm going to go for all the questioners our quarterback to call so that we don't have big lag here. And, John, just an observation that I agree with you. This is my third crisis in business. This one's a unique one. The other two were substantial. And I observe that there's cost that comes this added to income statement that comes from disruption. For example, we were shipping products, expediting product from China to get to the factories here, parts I should say, so that we didn't have any disruption. And as the virus spread like a water slick the stuff that we were air freighting was eventually going to get stopped in production. So, we had the cost of that and it is what Tim has talked about, that we've been working to offset those kinds of increased costs and there's a lot of examples of that. It is in the billions that we work to. Also confirming with you that in this time of focus, you start to think of things that matter to the company. I don't want you to think of them well, you should have stopped them anyways, these are things that there's no races going on. So, some of the investments that you would have because the virus has diminished participation and things, we don't have that cost so we have the savings there. And then having the focus that Jim Farley talked about, we find that we can actually improve our leverage. So, I want to confirm with you that, yes, we're thinking about this the same way. Now, you asked for some specifics and I'd like to turn it over to Jim, because I think China is a good example of where there was advantage as we came out of this. Jim. Jim Farley : Thanks, Jim, and hi John. So, in China, we learned a lot, not only to start up the operations safely, we started in mid-February, we're now up to 90% of our salary workforce and all of our plants are up and running. Actually, GMC never shut down. It is the best quarter ever. But they get after cost really quickly, we're able to offset all the COVID impact in the first quarter and we learned a lot. We learned that the mix coming out is very different than the mix going in. And so our mix of product is quite different. It is very favorable. We went online for our sales as said about a third of our sales are now online in North America, it is north of 25%. That's an efficiency and improvement in our fitness. We did lower costs, we expect that to sum that to flow, obviously, in North America, very focused on the recovery items on material costs and warranty costs. Those are the kind of costs that flow into subsequent years. In fact, we're more than committed ever in that 10% EBIT margin in North America. And as Jim said, we're forecasting a lower SAAR. So that must mean obviously our costs are going down. We do have some great launches coming up, which will be a tailwind in North America. The other things we learned in China that we're exporting is to ship patterns as you come back are very important, so are getting the launch teams in the facilities to work launches because we're just in year-end in China launching Kuga and localizing some of our larger SUVs. Those are very important for profitability, very same exercise we're doing in North American in certain fourth quarter. And the last one is supplier readiness. What we learned in China was got to make sure your supply basis ready. So, we've surveyed almost 1500 suppliers in Western Europe and the US to make sure they're ready to come up and have the same playbook in terms of prioritization of safety. So, yes, I mean, the bottom line is, it is a very difficult time, but Ford team is at its best, and we're going after crop costs that will flow. Thanks back to your Jim. Jim Hackett : Operator, we'll take the next question. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Thanks everybody. Good to hear from you. Just wanted to follow up on that question. So at this point, if we back out working capital looks like the business in the auto business is running at around a $1.3 billion burn in the quarter. And if you bring your CapEx down to the low 6s, maybe that could even converge on break even at something that looks like it corresponds with a $15 million SAAR. But you talked about coming out of it stronger. So, I was hoping maybe you could just tell us a little bit about some of the approaches that you're taking here. Are there any opportunities to accelerate restructuring, maybe in light of this crisis, and what do you think you might actually look like when we actually do recover to a $15 million SAAR? Jim Hackett : Thank you, Rod. It is Jim Hackett. Let me start with saying to you that 26 years in a job like this, I never had a business plan that was called pandemic. And I mean that in all sincerity because we just never imagined the economy turning off. And the other two crises that I was in we had deep troughs of issues, but this was unique. Secondly, board has been really diligent at working on a number of fronts that I'm proud to tell you, as I look back at other companies, which I would admire in our industry, that some of you referenced. And I take the beginning point of when I guess they started and where they are now, I would say that are the effort to get all the new products in the portfolio are going to be extraordinarily beneficial to the company. You just got to remember we're going from one of the oldest product lines to the new. And in the course of this pandemic comes in and interrupts. And it is going to slide, the timing of that, but we've got a new F150. We've got a new small rugged off road SUV. We've got an all-new Bronco. We got the Mustang Mach-E. So, all the work before the pandemic is valued that we're going to enjoy. This is why we've believed - we thought last year was going to be the tunnel year and we had the problems in Chicago. We've totally fixed that. Explorer was doing really well. And now we were waiting for this new product. The second thing is we started on restructuring, particularly in Europe. Just want to comment again, I'm not being cynical, but that was 40 years of problems that we took on in a very short time. We actually sped up the commitment for restructuring. Bob Shanks and I had one plan. We turned up the vitality of it, we spent ahead. We actually borrowed money to match the returns we were going to get. It all worked out. We're not done there. I'll let Jim in a minute explain what's going on. We initiated a redesign, and I don't know whether that sunk in, but we took over 25% of the management out of the company in advance of what we didn't expect, which is a pandemic, although we thought a recession was in the offing. Many of you said, this is the longest expansion when we were getting ready for that. So, that's serving us well. And in fact, the way the team's working now with a recent management change I made it is moving much faster with much more clarity. So, I'm just want to confirm that the only thing that I would witness with you is I didn't expect China to be a problem in the last two and a half years the way it turned out to be. But I now feel that there was more problems there than just what Ford enjoyed. And now, the work we did earlier to start getting things turned around, we actually are feeling confident that China's actually the picture there is going to improve. Particularly with the emphasis that we put on to get the product right in that market it wasn't right, which is the gestation period for getting all that flipped around is not the thing that happens in the course of 90-days or 6 months. But that's not asking you to wait longer. It is just saying that, if you're impatient about all the stuff we've done, and why aren't we seeing the value I'm trying to portray to you they are synchronous, and they will yield that, but I didn't expect the pandemic. So, Jim Farley, let me just tie this back to you and let you add virtue in terms of the way you see the restructuring in Europe. Jim Farley : Thanks, Jim. Hi, Rod. Very quickly. Just want to emphasize that the EU and South America restructuring are no regrets move. We reduced the headcount in Europe by 12,000 people teammates by the end of this year, we closed facilities. Bridgend still to come. We've cut costs, especially structural costs in South America. We have 40% less staff. We've gotten out of Fiesta and Focus. We got out of the heavy truck business and consolidated San Bernardo. So, those are no regrets move. But, the hangover COVID is obvious. And everything's on the table. Our team under owns the plan, it is they're still locked down and execute. In North America, we see a lot of opportunity and we want to make sure we have the capital to invest in North America. We do see a way to 10% EBIT in a lower industry even with the flow through of the cost actions we are taking plus as Jim said those great new products. And really for my team, they want to make sure that we have room for growth, especially in North America. And so that's why we're going to look at all the operations critically. Thanks. Over to you, Jim. Jim Hackett : Yes, Rod. And just to confirm there's that one truth, right, don't waste a crisis. So, I want to confirm to you that the attitude in the spirit is if we can speed things up or we can now have what I would say more productive discussions with social plans or governments, of course, all that's on the table. And the kinds of things that we would be working on but nothing to announce today. Rod Lache : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner, Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Good evening, everybody. Jim Hackett : Emmanuel, hi, confirming I can hear you. Thanks. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, great. I was actually hoping to ask yet another follow up on the restructuring plan. So, I hear you loud and clear. No grace period to fix Ford. Don't waste the crisis. That's certainly not just the right attitude, obviously, very much needed, especially if the industry doesn't recover through previous levels anytime soon. At the same time, I'm a little bit struggling with, I guess the budget set for restructuring that you have for this year, which is - and it remains pretty minimal was actually tweaked down a little bit even versus the last update. And I view it somewhat as inconsistent. So why can't you do more? Why can't you spend more? You've raised recently another $8 billion. It feels like now would be the time to do faster action to accelerate the process. And it seems like it doesn't seem to be budgeted, how do I reconcile that? Jim Hackett : Yes, well, I guess the, the confirmation I want to make is yes, your instincts are, that there can be more that can be done. We're talking about just - and draw a parallel to you in 14 days. We got a ventilator designed and built for the country. So, I know Ford can move really fast. And the pandemic, we sent everybody home on March 13th. So I don't know if you're asking in that time, you would have expected a plan that would, change the strategy of the company. And the way I think about the crisis is you got a priority first of stabilizing that you can operate and recover some of the costs that are just, flying out the door and that's where we did a really great job. In parallel, we've begun planning in discussions with the spirit of don't waste the crisis. And I just, confirm there's nothing to announce to you today, but would not be fair for you to walk away and say, Ford's not doing anything. I don't think that would be right. And I'd like to clear up what you just asked about the budget. So, I'm going to turn to Tim to make sure we're you're reading correctly, the way the cash flows are working, given that we had the roll off of the payables and what we have committed to restructuring, Tim? Tim Stone : Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Emmanuel. So as it relates to the restructuring, the charges in the cash for 2020 that we commented on $0.7 billion to $1.2 billion are associated with the redesign actions that have been announced. And the cumulative of that would be $4.4 billion to $4.9 billion in charges, on the way up to $11 billion, as we've talked about, and the cash would be $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion cumulative on the way up to $7 billion overtime. To the extent that we are thoroughly assessing and aggressively addressing our operations looking at, identify as always opportunities to improve our fitness and redesign the business to amplify long term potential. That's why we give the longer term view of up to $11 billion EBIT and up to $7 billion cash. But specific amounts we are guiding to or related to actions we've announced thus far. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. Thank you. Jim Hackett : Holly, back to you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question for the day will come from the line of Joe Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joe Spak : Thank you. Maybe just one quick one on Ford Credit. I understand you certainly took the write down of vehicles awaiting auction. I believe the way it works is you've got to also take the supplemental depreciation for the remaining term for the rest of the book. So, how should we think about that over the course the year? And are you still expecting Ford Credit to dividend anything back to the Motor Company this year? Jim Hackett : Thank you. I'm going to hand that to Marion Harris, who's the President of Ford Credit, Marion. Marion Harris : Thanks, Jim. Hi, Joe. How are you? So, good observation. So, let me talk about what was in the quarter and what was not in the quarter and then talk about the forward quarter. So, in the quarter credit loss reserve changes for the retail loan book and for our commercial lending, as well as credit loss estimates on the lease book which actually flows through lease accounting, as well as a reduced valuation on those vehicles that were just off lease and awaiting sale at auction. You correctly pointed out that in the period was not included any changes and outlook on future auction values of the portfolio, those changes in auction values will flow through the future periods according to lease accounting, and we describe that\u2019s in great detail in some of our educational disclosures that we have on the topic. We\u2019re not going to disclose today. We\u2019re giving guidance on what we think that will be in the future. It is still too uncertain as Tim said. We don\u2019t know the depth that for how long the auction market will be disrupted, but we are very confident that the used vehicle market will return to normal. And then on dividends, the only thing I would say is their function of net income and balance sheet size and leverage and it'll be what it'll be. We're still continuing to target an eight to nine leverage. Back to you, Jim. Joe Spak : Thank you, Marion. Operator : Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jim Hackett for closing comments. Jim Hackett : Yes, thank you. Thank you, callers. As I mentioned this represents the third meta-level crisis I've been involved with as a CEO. And yes, this one not only tragically has had a larger human toll, it also represents a first where for all intents and purposes, the economy was turned off. In the face of all these events, I've been able to pay witness to those who rise to be better and likely surprise you with their resourcefulness, selflessness and ultimately resilience. Companies too define themselves in the times of crisis. We hope that we've been able to talk to you why we think you are seeing Ford at its best as we protected our people and we did all we can to serve our fellow men and we believe we safeguarded the bright future of Ford Motor Company. We look forward to sharing more of our response and the ideas that you've asked about and impact as there will be lingering effects of the virus until it is totally contained. With that, we're all adjourned and thank you for joining us tonight. Operator : This concludes the Ford Motor Company first quarter earnings conference call.",

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn? Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, Sedaris. Welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company\u2019s second quarter earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Hackett, our President and CEO; and Tim Stone, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us today for Q&A are Jim Farley, Chief Operating Officer; and Marion Harris, CEO, Ford Credit. Jim Hackett will begin with some color on the quarter, and then, Tim, will talk about our results in more depth, and then we\u2019ll turn to -- to turn -- turn to Q&A. Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Today\u2019s discussion includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated and the most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on slide 23. In addition, unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year, company EBIT, EPS and operating cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is on a volume weighted basis. A quick update on two upcoming IR events, first, on Monday, August 3rd, RBC will host a fireside chat with us. Tim Stone; Hau N Thai-Tang, our Chief Product Development and Purchasing Officer; and Gary Johnson, our Chief Manufacturing and Labor Affairs Officer will participate. And then on Wednesday, August 15th, Kumar Galhotra, President Americas and International Markets Group will participate in the Jefferies Industrial Conference. Now let me turn the call over to Jim Hackett. Jim Hackett : Thanks, Lynn, and hello to everyone. In a moment I will share with you how absolutely proud I am of the way our team has performed during the COVID pandemic, which of course, has challenged every aspect of our business. But before I do, I don\u2019t want this moment to pass without giving some important perspective on where Ford Motor Company stands relative to racial justice. I\u2019ve been heartened, frankly, to see our industry, like, other industries step-up in the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd. And of course, hand-in-hand with others, there\u2019s a deep outpouring of collective grief and frustration that moved us all very deeply. It was much more than a moment and time that will fade but rather, we must make it a turning point for our society. Ford is committed to leading from the front with action to enable social mobility and economic success in the African-American community, include -- including programs in which the company has invested for more than a century. The Ford Motor Company Fund in particular invests in a broad range of initiatives addressing social justice, racism, equality and economic opportunity, and we\u2019re looking forward to more opportunities to affect positive change. Now, in the past week since Mr. Floyd death, I have met nightly with a small team of people to think as deeply as possible about what has not worked in the past that we need to address in the future. We\u2019ve begun to map the experience of Black Lives of Ford and see areas where improvements and enhancement would go a long way to address many of the concerns that have been voiced. Ford is committed to leading from the front and taking action and the results will prove themselves over time. This is deeply a part of our culture and history in the Ford Motor Company Fund in particular, has invested over many decades at the ground level to address issues of social justice, racism, equality and economic opportunity, and we look forward to sharing much more of this in the future. Okay, so let me turn to the quarter, which I would summarize in two ways. First, strong execution in this challenging environment, and second, meaningful progress on our plan to create a vibrant Ford Motor Company with exciting products that people want and well-positioned to capitalize on the new technology and trends that are transforming our industry. I couldn\u2019t be prouder, as I said, of the optimism and the effectiveness our team demonstrated managing through and beyond the COVID crisis. From the start, I think, Ford has distinguished itself on three principles, protecting our team and doing our part to limit the spread of the virus, safeguarding the health of our business and stepping up the building supplying much needed personal protective and healthcare equipment. On all three accounts [ph] the team performed exceptionally well under difficult circumstances. This strong execution enabled us to deliver much better financial results than we expected just three months ago. For example, our team did a fantastic job safely restarting production and wholesale exceeded targets. Frankly, our focus on safety enabled our efficient restart as we followed our return to work playbook very, very closely. Our focused on safety also extended to our supply chain as we work directly with our suppliers and logistics providers to minimize the disruption. In addition, our team also worked hard on costs, including CapEx, which help reduce losses and cash burn in the quarter ad these factors are what led to our outperformance. Another highlight of the quarter is our profitable Commercial Vehicle business. It continues to gain share globally. And Ford Credit, it remains a pillar of strength for our customers and it\u2019s a competitive advantage. So we\u2019re all proud to tell you that the balance sheet remains extremely solid and positions us to weather further disruptions and headwinds. Tim will provide further details in a moment on the balance sheet. Importantly, this intense focus on manage -- managing through the crisis is not knocked us off our mission to author own destiny and shape the future of Ford. Since our last earnings call, we have revealed the all new 2021 F-150 and are on our new Bronco family of vehicles. These vehicles along with upcoming Mustang Mach-E represent Ford\u2019s modern product vision, highly desirable iconic vehicles packed with innovation and human-centered design features. And they\u2019re fully connected in ways to enhance quality and constantly improving ownership experience through fast over the air updates. Let me give you some color on the F-150. The all new version we showed in June was born from decades of deep focus on what customers want, a new human-centered design capabilities that helps us invent the unobvious features and capability customers will love and value. The new F-150 is packed with dozens of new innovative features and upgrades that we believe will make this the market leading truck for 43 years and that\u2019s an even stronger proposition for our customers. We\u2019re in great shape to launch the new one -- the new F-150 on time, and with high quality, which of course, requires now change over in our plants in Dearborn in Kansas City. An important sell down of the current model is also going well as demonstrated by great news in our market share. For example, in the U.S. while sales decline, we perform better than the industry due in part to the strength from our trucks that\u2019s being the F-150, Ranger and our SUVs exploring Lincoln Aviator and Corsair. The total share was up 20 basis points in the quarter to 14.5% and within that number our retail share was up 120 basis points to 13.3% as series gained 250 basis points of segment share to 33.3% Turning to the all new Bronco. The outpouring of enthusiasm from the public immediate after the reveal earlier this month, candidly speaks for itself. Reservations for Bronco, well, they surpassed even our most optimistic initial projections. Our entire team like the over 150,000 customers who reserve one are super excited about the Bronco. This family of vehicles has big upside potential in the growing off-road category and this is a category with a leading OEM. There\u2019s not been seriously challenged until now and we have proven credibility in this off-road space with Raptor in particular and we are the number one cross shop brand for jeep today. Initial customer demand for Bronco is so high that we are actively working to increase our annual production right now. I also want to give you a quick personal story on the status of the Mach-E, which will go on sale later this year and opportunity to drive an advanced prototype recently in Ann Arbor [ph]. The experience was just stunning from start to finish. When you sit in the driver\u2019s seat, everything is personalized. My profile automatically loaded into the Mach-E before I press the start button, seat position, screen colors, preferences, Apple CarPlay in ways were seamlessly integrated into the SYNC 4 system. I didn\u2019t set off on drive in whisper mode. Now the drive was astonishingly smooth and powerful. And I use the one pedal driving system, braking and battery regeneration were perfectly integrated. Then, I did switch on bridle mode. You can see me smiling and I can tell you the performance was pure Mustang. Sure foot [ph] is incredibly quick as I took curves. The experience was incredibly intuitive and the cluster tells you exactly what you need to know, if nothing extraneous. Yes, I left with a big smile on my face because I know our customers will soon enjoy this same experience. When I see these products come to life, I feel better and better about our decision to reallocate capital spending from sedans to trucks and commercial vehicles and SUVs, was controversial at the time, it\u2019s paying off. We have even more new products in the pipeline in areas where Ford is strong today and its whitespaces where we can earn stronger returns and grow share. Now these new products are critical to our target to reduce the age of our showroom in the U.S. by over 40% or more competitive 3.1 years by 2023. OEMs really with the highest replacement rate and younger showroom age have generally gained market share profitably. It\u2019s a good place to be in. By several third-party measurements, Ford brand reputation is improving as well and we believe we have much more potential for improvement as we launch these new exciting products. I just want to take a moment and touch on our plan for electric vehicles. We\u2019re about midway through our plan to invest more than $11.5 billion through 2022 and there\u2019ll be more after that with an increasing mix of spend on all-electric vehicles. For bringing the power of choice to our customers with hybrids, plug-in hybrids and pure electric, by the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll have 15 electrified nameplates available to customers around the world and nearly 10% of our wholesales will come from some Ford forms, excuse me, of electrification. We are deploying this technology across our lineup and price points to bring improved capability, fuel economy and emissions to as many people as possible just as we did with our EcoBoost technology a decade ago. Nameplates that will follow are all-electric are the territory in China are Escape and Kuga plug-in hybrids, which offer an estimated 100 mpg and the F-150 PowerBoost hybrid, I just ordered one of these, as well as our Mustang Mach-E BEV. These will be followed by an all-electric versions of our market leading F-150 and Transit vans. Electric vehicles are also a big part of Lincoln\u2019s future and you\u2019ll see this unfold in the months and years ahead. As you know, in June, we finalized our strategic alignment -- alliance with VW, which will accelerate execution of our commercial vehicle and electric vehicle strategy. This alliance also significantly strengthens Argo AI, which now combines unmatched expertise with the global reach of Ford and VW together. This positions Ford well as self-driving vehicles become a significant new source of revenue and profit in the years to come. Maybe journey will be a long one, but Ford is now well-positioned to run this race and compete like few others can. Finally, in a moment, Tim will provide an update on the progress of our global redesign. We are aggressively reshaping our business and restructuring underperforming operations around the world, rationalizing our product portfolio to play to our strengths and attacking costs. Obviously, Ford isn\u2019t immune to the effects of the pandemic, including the new vehicle market that has been waylaid by the pandemic. But we continue to manage through this crisis even as we continue to create a vibrant profitably growing company, one that we\u2019re confident, we\u2019ll win in an era of smart vehicles for a smart world. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tim for more color on the quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year. Tim? Tim Stone : Great. Thanks, Jim. In addition to our operational execution this quarter, in the face of unprecedented industry headwinds, our results demonstrated progress as we fix areas of the business that have held us back in the past, including cost and launch execution. And acceleration in areas of strength like commercial vehicles and SUVs, as well as newer capabilities like connectivity, tangible progress in electrification and autonomous vehicles, both essential to our long-term growth. And lastly, the favorable impacts of our global redesign and a more focused portfolio of fresh products for customers. We also demonstrated discipline in the management of our balance sheet and continue to maintain strong liquidity to ensure financial flexibility in these uncertain times. We ended the quarter with over $39 billion in cash and liquidity, reflecting almost $10 billion of new debt in the quarter, including the $8 billion unsecured issuance we completed in April. In the second quarter, our working capital dynamics played out as we highlighted on our first quarter earnings call. As production resumed in mid-May, our payables and cash balance recovered sharply. The restoration and production payables will continue into the third quarter, as we reach near full production in late June. On July 27th, we repaid $7.7 billion of our outstanding $15.4 billion corporate revolvers. We also extended $4.8 billion of our lines of credit from April 22 to July 23. Our current liquidity of almost $40 billion is sufficient to maintain or exceed our target cash balance of $20 billion through the second half of this year, even if global demand declines, or if there\u2019s another wave of COVID-related plant closures. Looking at results in automotive, both wholesale and revenue are down due to the suspension in manufacturing. To give you some color on wholesales, earlier this year, pre-COVID, we had expected wholesale units to be about 800,000 higher than the 645,000 we reported in the quarter. Our decline in automotive EBIT was driven by the decline in volume. So this was partially offset by over a $1 billion improvement in both net pricing and cost. The cost improvement was a net of four primary areas, lower structural costs, due to suspended production and one-time cost actions like reduced marketing, both of which were partially offset by higher material costs for new products and regulatory compliance and higher warranty. We do expect warranty to be up for the year. Looking at our business units in more detail, North America was shut down for six weeks in the quarter, but like the other regions, manufacturing came up smoothly. In fact, North America was operating about -- at about 95% of pre-COVID production levels by the end of the quarter. In addition to the improvements in share, as Jim mentioned, the North America team was laser focused on minimizing the impacts of lower volume through the aggressive management of costs, including reducing facility costs, media spend and the elimination of all discretionary spending. The team also focused on yield management actions, which benefit both revenue and EBIT. In South America, our plants were mostly idled in the quarter. But as with North America, we brought production up efficiently. Market share declined largely driven by lower sales to rental companies and our global redesign actions last year to exit heavy trucks and unprofitable products, such as Fiesta and Focus. However, both Ranger and EcoSport did well, as Ranger the number two midsize pickup globally gained share. Relative to profitability, this was the third consecutive quarter of improving year-over-year results as we continue to hone our cost position, including lower headcount and improve mix. In Europe, all of our plants came up successfully by May 4th. Profitability was favorably impacted by the benefits of our global redesign, as well as our more focused approach on three customer segments, commercial vehicles, select passenger vehicles and imports. Relative to global redesign, we are on track to deliver by the end of this year roughly a $1 billion improvement in structural cost since the actions began during the third quarter of 2018. This includes a 10,000 positions in Western Europe, of which 7,500 reductions have been completed, a reduction of over 2,000 positions in Europe. The balance of the positions in Western Europe will be eliminated by the end of this year. We\u2019ve also reduced costs by reducing our manufacturing footprint by six facilities down to a total of 17. Or sharper focus on product strengths, allowed us to extend our leadership in commercial vehicles, as we reached 15.1% share in June, an increase of 220 basis points. We are on track this year to meet the new CO2 regulatory requirements for both passenger and commercial vehicles supported by our growing portfolio of electrified vehicles. For example, in the first half of this year, our new Puma MHEV reached 80% mix and Kuga PHEV and MHEV collectively reached 57% mix. Now on the horizon, about Transit, we are enjoying our Transit families ICE and hybrid powertrains. In China, the only region to post again the wholesales, wholesales were up double digits, as we\u2019ve benefited from the newly launched Escape and Lincoln Corsair and strong commercial vehicle sales. Corsair, our first locally produced Lincoln products contributed to a 12% increase in sales from Lincoln and the all new locally produced Aviator is launching now. China also posted its second consecutive quarter of share gain of 20 basis points to 2.5%, its highest market share since the third quarter 2018. Our strength in commercial vehicles was supported by a 34% increase in sales at JMC, our JV partner, which gained 40 basis points a share. As with other regions through cost discipline, China has done a great job mitigating the profit impact of COVID. China\u2019s focus on cash flow also delivered a step function change in working capital, driven by the benefits of localization, as well as CapEx efficiencies. In mobility, we continue to make investments to commercialize our Autonomous Vehicle business, including product development, engineering and testing. Our six test markets for Argo AI constitute what we believe is the largest active urban test footprint of any self driving vehicle developer. As Jim mentioned, in the quarter, we closed on our new partnership with VW and Argo AI. This generate -- generated a gain of $3.5 billion, which was recorded as a special item. Argo AI, which is the self-driving system portion of our AV business, is now deconsolidated. Despite the deconsolidation, we do expect our investments in AV reflected in our consolidated mobility results to continue at similar levels for the reasons I noted earlier. In mobility we also continue to invest to build out capabilities and connected services, including our FordPass and Ford Commercial Solutions platforms. In fact, we\u2019ve centralized our enterprise connectivity team to accelerate the delivery of human-centered connected experiences for our customers. We expect this sharper focus to also provide benefits to the enterprise to improve customer experience and quality. Ford Credit delivered a strong profitable quarter, demonstrating its uniquely compelling value for customers and competitive advantage. Our prudent actions in the first quarter ensured we were adequately reserved in light of the macro uncertainty created by COVID. Portfolio performance was strong, and delinquencies and charge-offs were record levels -- record low levels. Ford Credit provided extensions to about 11% of U.S. customers through May, an unprecedented move. Over 90% of these customers have resumed payments without delinquency and we are very pleased with the performance of this portfolio. Lease share remain below industry average and off lease auction performance was better than expected, up 3% sequentially and down 2% year-over-year. We began the quarter with close auctions, growing inventory and falling prices. However, May we saw a healthy recovery in auction volume and prices. At present, we forecast lower auction values for the full year of about 5% consistent with third-party estimates. Now let me turn to guidance. Guidance assumes no meaningful change with current economic environment, continues steady improvement in the stability of the global automotive supply base and no further significant COVID-related disruptions to production or distribution. In the third quarter, we expect to be profitable with adjusted EBIT of $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion, reflecting the economic impact of COVID, weaker global demand for new vehicles, parts and services, and lower profit from Ford Credit. Our recent practice has been to comment on the upcoming quarter only, because of the significant launch activity in the fourth quarter, we thought some early color would be helpful. We expect adjusted EBIT to be a loss in the fourth quarter, driven by the volume impact of new F-150 launch and lower ongoing industry volumes. Note that our major launches in North America have shifted to the fourth quarter in line with our COVID-related production disruption.  We anticipate the downtime changeover and ramp-up will reduce F-150 wholesale significantly in the quarter. This launch impact will more than offset the non-occurrence of the 2019 UAW contract bonuses in the fourth quarter, which is worth roughly $600 million. Our new Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E are also launching in the quarter. The limited level of wholesales will not have a material impact on our fourth quarter results. We also expect lower Ford Credit profits in the fourth quarter versus last year. All that said, we expect adjusted EBIT to be a loss for the full year. I\u2019m optimistic that we\u2019re well-positioned for what lies ahead and to deliver excellent products and services for our customers. With that, let me turn the call back to, Jim, for a few comments before we move to Q&A. Jim Hackett : Thanks, Tim. Yeah. Just a few comments, I want to reinforce the following about the quarter and the second half of this year. In the face of unprecedented sector headwinds operationally, we maintained robust safety protocols and aggressively mitigated production losses, while effectively navigating a tenuous supply base, I mean, everything was in motion. We\u2019re keenly focused on cost and cash discipline. Jim Farley led an effort here that\u2019s just extraordinary. We are optimistic and ready for the production ramp-up of the F-150, the Mach-E as you\u2019ve heard, the Bronco Sport and Bronco, all with the spirit of high quality and extreme focus on doing a great job there. We continue important investments. We didn\u2019t stop spending on the future in commercial vehicles, AV, connectivity and electrification. We did continue to implement our global redesign and portfolio refresh and we have measurable results to show that this is going very well. And as you just heard from Tim, we did a great job of this. We have a discipline management of our balance sheet and an extremely strong liquidity position from all the actions we took earlier this year. This ensures our financial flexibility, particularly as we know in uncertain time. So, Operator, with that, let\u2019s move to Q&A, please. Operator : Okay. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from a line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good evening, guys. Just a first question, Tim, as we look at sort of the guidance you\u2019d given us on the second quarter. You kind of blew it out of the water here. I mean, you\u2019re talking about a $5 billion plus EBIT loss, and you came in well better than that. I\u2019m just curious, what changed and what do you think the major factors are? And then also, I mean, if you think about price and cost, which seemed to be two big levers, how sticky could those benefits be going forward. So really just -- what change and how durable is the change? Tim Stone : Great. Ultimately, the performance in the second quarter comes down to operational execution by the teams. And if you look at our return to work, which is not only safely, but production in our wholesales, vehicle sales came with that and inventory management, really strong performance by the teams. We were near full production by the end of the quarter and we -- greater cost reductions and cash reductions than we had anticipated initially as well. Again, base on the keen focus on cost and cash. There is also favorable pricing environment for products and mix. And Ford Credit auction values and credit losses overall portfolio performance was strong. So, I guess, at the end of the day a strong execution. And as it relate -- second part of your question again was -- as related to how much sales is going to prevail in the year? John Murphy : Well -- yeah. How sticky is that sort of that outperformance, because it does sound like a lot of it was micro, and as you said, just execution, I mean, do you think some of that was sort of transitory in response to sort of austerity measures or how sticky is this? Tim Stone : I think the operational execution is something we pride ourselves on and expect to work really hard to make sure it\u2019s very sticky. We\u2019ve got a lot of work ahead of us for sure in the back half of the year with some really important launches in the fourth quarter and we continue to drive improvements in the fixed accelerate grow areas that we\u2019ve talked about. But as reflected in our guidance for profitability in the third quarter is, we\u2019re going to continue to operate in an operationally excellent manner. John Murphy : Okay. And then just a second question, I think, Jim Farley is on, when we look at the Bronco launch, a lot of hype around the truck, which is, at least from my opinion is well deserved, a lot of excitement there around the Sport as well this year. But it seems like there is -- this is sort of the start of something much more than even just those two vehicles when you talk about the Bronco family. So just trying to understand, will we be looking at something four years, five years, six years down the line, where there could be a portfolio of Bronco vehicles that mimics or mirrors sort of more what jeep has. I am just trying to understand what the potential is above and beyond what we know at the moment and it seems like there\u2019s a lot more on the horizon? Jim Farley : Thanks, John. Hi. As Jim and Tim mentioned, the Bronco reception has been very positive. The reservation numbers are far beyond what we expected and these are two broad appeal nameplates in three body styles, so we don\u2019t have in our portfolio today. So we\u2019re not getting ahead of ourselves on Bronco. We have a lot of work to do to launch these products to do with world-class quality and don\u2019t forget our ambition is to launch over 200 accessories and really create a brand, the sub-brand within Ford like we have like F-Series. So we have a lot to do and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. John, there is no shortage of great ideas for Bronco\u2019s Ford Motor Company. But we have a great foundation to start with these three names -- these three body styles. I would expect for, like, we\u2019ve always done, like, we\u2019ve learned from F-Series over the years, decades, that will rollout family or Bronco like we\u2019re doing in our own way, targeted to our own customers, where we see openings in the market for customers to be thrilled and we do see that opportunity in the market. So I wouldn\u2019t hold ourselves or benchmark ourselves against another OEM, our ideas is to play to win by going after specific customers that are underserved. Thanks. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner, Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi. Good evening, everybody. Jim Hackett : Hi, there. Emmanuel Rosner : My first question is trying to understand a little bit better how to think about the rest of the year? When I look at your cost performance in the quarter, maybe on slide 11, so $1.1 billion overall net basis, but $1.8 billion qualify this structural anyway to dimension for us how much of those structural costs are more temporary actions in the quarter, when you had shutdown for an extended period of time versus something that we could assume could continue on year-over-year business going forward and then still about the rest of the year\u2019s outlook? Anyway for you to dimension for us the magnitude of the impacts on the F-150 change over either in terms of weeks of shutdown or units, anything that could be helpful to dimension? Jim Hackett : So, Emmanuel, it\u2019s Jim Hackett, I think, I\u2019m going to send that to Tim. Tim Stone : Yeah. Great. Thanks, Jim. So as it relates cost actions, we\u2019ve been taking -- we have been talking about for some time now is the focus on fitness and design of the business. And so we\u2019re going to continue to be passionately focused on making sure the right design for the business and with fitness as a priority. And so certainly, there are things that we appropriately undertook to preserve cash and reduce costs in response to the environment. But we\u2019re also looking at opportunities to learn from this and identify areas to further accelerate our fitness and redesign opportunities that are ahead. So that\u2019s really what I have to say and that -- otherwise essentially reflected in the guidance, we have the third and fourth quarters as we look out. And on the third -- go ahead. Emmanuel Rosner : Sorry. The second part was around the\u2026 Tim Stone : Yeah. Emmanuel Rosner : \u2026F-150 changeover? Tim Stone : Yeah. On the F-150 side, we try to do is characterize it is more impactful than the UAW launch essentially, of 6 -- sorry, UAW contract bonuses of $600 million. So beyond that, there is not much more we can we can say. Certainly when you have America\u2019s best-selling vehicle for 38 years and gaining share of best series in the quarter, you can see the popularity of that vehicle claiming to our overall business. So the ramp down, ramp back up with a successful launch will have a big impact on the quarter which to our expect we never loss. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. Thank you. And then I was hoping to get actually a little bit more from your latest thoughts from the global redesign plan and the opportunity to use this industry downturn potentially to accelerate this. I guess, in terms of the, I think, you mentioned during the prepared remarks that you expect $1 billion of benefits by the end of the year. I wanted to just first understand on what basis that is, is it for 2020 versus 2019 or is it since the beginning of the program and how to think about the opportunity to accelerate it, what are your latest thoughts there? Tim Stone : As it relates to Europe comment, by the end of this year we expect to have roughly $1 billion improvement in structural cost actions since the beginning when was announced in Q3 \u201818 it\u2019s cumulative. That includes the reductions of positions I mentioned 10,000 positions in Western Europe, 7,500 of which have been completed already, as well as 2,000 positions in Russia, as well as the reduction of manufacturing footprint by six facilities on a total of 17. So, again, we\u2019re going to review our center in order to look at opportunities to make sure we\u2019re the right design for the business as we look out at the opportunities ahead of us and nothing incremental to announce at this moment. But to-date, we\u2019ve incurred $3.9 billion of EBIT charges and $1.4 billion of cash. So you with $7.1 billion to go, up to $7.1 billion to go and charges up to $5.6 billion in cash. The other thing you know, continue to execute on the result as well, so nothing new to announce at this time, but you\u2019re keenly focused on it. Emmanuel Rosner : Great. Thank you. Jim Hackett : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. Philippe Houchois : Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. I\u2019ve got a couple of questions. One is when I listened to you, Tim, about the Q4 guidance going back into loss because of launch costs, it seems like a lot of their assumptions, also a weaker Q4 and things like that -- it\u2019s not said that you\u2019re definitely going back into loss, a lot would depend potentially on the sock. I wonder if you can comment and give us some kind of no diamonds on the range of outcomes potentially. Another question was also to you, in terms of -- now you\u2019ve done quite an impressive work and terms of protecting cash and also starting to deleverage the capital structure. I couldn\u2019t help noticing your interest expense almost doubled in Q2. That\u2019s was a point of discussion with a lot investors that the interest expense is cut into earnings momentum. What are you doing, and how quickly can you actually get the interest expense under controls, so we can make sure we don\u2019t lose the operating definition to the currency leverage? Jim Hackett : Great. So let me start with the interest expense. It has ticked up as we bolster a balance sheet and ensure we have not only strong cash position, strong liquidity position, and it suits us very well. And then, as we looked out, we feel comfortable with our cash position and confident so that such that we repaid and roughly half of the outstanding revolvers that we drew down earlier this week.  And we\u2019ll continue to look at opportunities to repay additional debt including revolvers over time as a business performed and -- I mean - anything announced at this time, but certainly we\u2019ll be looking at opportunities to reduce interest expense and delever the balance sheet in that way is where am I as the debt levels come down, of course we have the $40 billion liquidity, as you repeat a line of credit, so feel comfortable with our cash and liquidity position. The interest expense for the back half of the year, you can assume roughly $0.5 billion per quarter will be a reasonable expectation. And then your question on S.A.R, year-to-date S.A.R was about 13.4 million units in the first half and we see this improving throughout the year. And beyond that, I think we\u2019ll add more colors a year progresses. But we do see again an opportunity for it to improve as the year progresses. Philippe Houchois : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Hi, everybody. I was hoping just to revisit that question about costs, that $1 billion of Europe savings is obviously a big number. But when I look at slide 11 on the bridge in Europe, when I look at costs, I see zero. And I\u2019m assuming that that\u2019s because your variable costs, mostly regulatory is offsetting your structural cost savings. So, just taking a higher level look the question about the $1.8 billion of structural costs and people are wondering whether that there is some significant proportion of that, that could be permanent, and some of that may be shifting from the first half the second half or coming back. Is there a risk here that your -- either the structural costs kind of get off go away, but the variable cost inflation that we see like material freight warranty that kind of space? Tim Stone : Yeah. I guess what I want to say is that the team has been very focused on opportunities, not just during this time of COVID crisis, but before that to get more fit and improve our cost structure, you are seeing that 900 line results entering into the crisis. With the crisis, we\u2019ve had an opportunity to further reassess how we work and what opportunities we have in our cost structure to demonstrate to ourselves, we can take swift action, again, the teams around the world has done a great job in all areas. We are certainly mindful of what you\u2019re suggesting that these costs come back into the cost structure in ways that are unwelcome. But we\u2019re going to do everything we can to make sure that well, it shouldn\u2019t be volume related costs, but we\u2019re going to get more and more fit over time. Rod Lache : Okay. And just a question on the launches that you\u2019re talking about, you talked about the disruption, but obviously, there is some pretty big benefits potentially next year. I was hoping you might just talk specifically about F-150 and what it would take to put that into the positive bucket that you need a significant amount of pricing to offset higher variable costs there. And on the Bronco, is it conceivable that you could produce 150,000 units a year there or is that just beyond the capability or the scope of what\u2019s possible? Jim Hackett : So, Rob, it\u2019s Jim Hackett. I\u2019m going to ask Jim Farley, can you imagine the calls we\u2019ve gotten Rod about how many can you make so. He has been working on that day and night, so I\u2019ll give him that in just a second. But I want to make sure I\u2019m tracking with you on Europe in the sense that, you understand that structural costs effort ahead of the pandemic looks to be really precious, doesn\u2019t it and the absorption there without the volume is because of the effort that these guys have put forward. So I\u2019m not worried that as you just portrayed that there is a variable costs kind of avalanche that you know, smothers us, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen. Right now, we\u2019re not anticipating big inflation, for example. In fact, suppliers are all trying to get back up to levels of efficiency where we start to enjoy some savings. So I just want to add that color to the way I think about variable costs. I understand why you were looking at the forecast, but I just step back and think about that. But Jim, do you want to talk about the Bronco, great news and the challenge. Jim Farley : Yeah. Thanks, Jim. Hi, Rod. So, maps, right down the street from our Dearborn headquarters is where we will make Bronco as in North America and then the Bronco\u2019s Ford down in Mexico. As far as the Bronco that we\u2019ve received over 100,000 reservations that operations to shift pattern, so we have some upside. We have a lot of work to do because these are reservations not orders yet. So we have a lot of work to verify that the mix is great enthusiasm and we still continue to get lots of reservations. So the team has multiple capacity studies, we do have some opportunity, it would commit to another shift which is a big deal for us. As you can imagine, but obviously the reception has been really positive and looks sustained now. On F-150, we\u2019re in the prototype build both in Kentucky and in Dearborn looks great. We\u2019re on plan with the supplier readiness, manufacturer readiness and all the software, obviously this is a big milestone for OTA and lifestyle for us. So it\u2019s important deliverable for the team. And we have a long way to go on the F-150 launch. But the team has made great progress. We\u2019re finding issues and addressing them immediately. So we\u2019re feeling like I would portrayed is on plan, and yes, there is upside for Bronco. Rod Lache : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC. Joseph Spak : Thank you. Tim maybe asked about the second half guidance you know this way. If there wasn\u2019t a program delay, would you have basically issued the same guidance, just the cadence has been a little bit different? Tim Stone : It\u2019s hard for me to re -- undo what\u2019s happened over the past few months. We\u2019ve had -- the delays were having are commensurate with what happened as a result of the production shutdown. And the teams throughout that timeframe did a great job getting us ready for launch. And so if you look at the back half of the year in aggregate, we\u2019re essentially guiding to less than $0.5 billion to $1.5 billion of profit. And certainly, there has been a shift to the fourth quarter as a result of those losses in the big impact on F-150 being in the fourth quarter. Joseph Spak : Okay. And maybe just on cash flow and the balance sheet, so you pay back part of the revolver if we pro forma that for the June, cash and debt levels you indicated. You are sort of back to the December net cash levels. But then you do have at least some losses right in the fourth quarter or there is more CapEx a little bit more redesign cash here and something more beyond this year. So, I don\u2019t -- I know you sort of usually talk about liquidity, not necessarily sort of net automotive cash or debt. But how do you see that sort of playing out. How do you see the balance sheets are playing out over the next couple of years, because there still are some calls on the cash I would see? Tim Stone : Yeah. I mean, first, I want to emphasize for the third quarter, we expected cash flow to be higher than EBIT and the fourth quarter would be lower due to the timing of the working capital, social, the launches and the seasonal effects. As you look further out, from a liquidity standpoint, we have, of course, confidence in our ability to repay the debt that we have. We have net debt roughly equal to cash. And what we said was that even in scenarios where we have a COVID related plant closures again and/or demand declines that would have $20 billion or more in cash. So our certainly our base expectation is for more than that. And as we look out to the future, we\u2019re focused on optimizing our free cash flow driving toward our long-term margin opportunities and with that will come even greater cash and liquidity opportunities for us to consider none of the pain downloads and credit, of course, but through paying debt, receiving the dividend and to dilute sharer purchases as well. Joseph Spak : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Thanks very much. My first question is on EV batteries and it\u2019s kind of a question about make versus buy. So GM is making their own batteries with a joint venture in Ohio with LG. You\u2019re not going that route in terms of owning the physical plant capacity. What drives that thinking? And specifically there is a lot of options and this isn\u2019t the only one, but Elon Musk has offered to sell batteries or like EV powertrain skateboards to other OEMs. Would you consider doing that? Jim Hackett : Hey, Adam. It\u2019s Jim. Thank you. It\u2019s a question that when maybe a year ago, we started to see lines starting to arrange around, make versus buy own versus source. So we had a deep discussion about this. I\u2019ve met with a number of the people that that are in the supply side of this and it was our estimation. In fact, our whole team went through a really deep dive on this six months ago that the supply chain has ramped up since EV his [ph] Gigafactory. And so there is plenty there that does not warrant us to migrate our capital into owning our own factory. There is no advantage in the ownership in terms of a cost or a sourcing as what Ford can draw on. So I just can confirm to you that it actually works. It works for us to go the path we are now. With that said, there is some challenges that are in that supply chain between themselves. There is some litigation that\u2019s going on. We\u2019re hopeful that, they get settled quickly. It really doesn\u2019t matter to us how it gets settled, but it may, it confuses some of the suppliers about their investments in some of their plants here in the United States, which is another way of saying the way the U.S. MCA would benefit as intended is to have these factories be built in the United States for supply of batteries and so we\u2019re well positioned believing that will happen. Adam Jonas : Thanks. Thanks, Jim. And then I got a follow-up for Jim Farley. Jim, if it -- and I\u2019m asking you specifically just because you\u2019re kind of still -- I\u2019ll still consider you new in your role, your new role. If you think three years out, how radically different is Ford motor company three years from now versus today. Can you kind of what are some of the big, big changes, not the subtle stuff, the major stuff that you want to highlight to folks on this call tonight? Thanks, Jim. Jim Farley : Thanks Adam. Yeah. I would say -- I would characterize Ford\u2019s transformation as we know what we\u2019re really good at and we have tremendous opportunity to grow in those areas and commercial is a great example. It took us decades to build the commercial ecosystem we have today, exclusive distribution, bailment, upfitters, a deep relationship with customers, real deep know how in the company. As we look forward in the next three to five years, you can expect a Ford\u2019s commercial business to change a lot and part of that is cooperation of Volkswagen in places like Europe, but other parts of it will be the mobility transformation of commercial. So I would say Adam, you can expect Ford\u2019s transformation to be in the areas that we\u2019re already really good at, we have capability and that we\u2019re humbly approaching the business model and the ecosystem build out for those new growth opportunities with a fresh set of eyes. And just like we did decades ago when we built these businesses like commercial and it tremendous opportunity for value creation and for our customers especially. I think that gives you a good taste for how we see things as well as in much tighter geographic profile. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Jim. Appreciate that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Hi. Good evening, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to start with a question on Bronco here. And I know you don\u2019t disclose your exact variable profit per unit, but maybe if you could just give us a sense from the perspective of variable, profit per unit, how we should think of where Bronco potentially could stack up versus other vehicles in the four lineup? Obviously it\u2019s not going to be at the level of F-Series, I would think that\u2019s been the case. But I would venture to guess though, that it could be right up there, maybe above an explore or just the below and expedition or navigator. Just give us some sense of from a profit per unit standpoint, how we should be thinking about Bronco and the opportunity, because we know that your competitor in this area and doing quite well in that product. Jim Hackett : Yeah. So my first reaction I\u2019m thinking, thank God we made the decision, right? Because you know what it replaced in the facility where we\u2019re making in some of the sedans we\u2019re making money. So you got to think of that with Adam\u2019s last question about the makeup of Ford and what\u2019s going out and what\u2019s coming in and product. And Jim, I\u2019ll let you talk about some of our targets there. Jim Farley : Sure. Thanks Jim. Appreciate the question. The real breakthrough for us on Bronco was the localization of the Ranger that a very successful global Ranger here in North America. And we\u2019re already have very strong scale and performance with the Ranger in the U.S. The large Bronco and the C2 Bronco Sport are both based on existing platforms that we have executed many times. And so we\u2019re not going to go into specific profitability, but you can imagine compared to a Ranger, the kind of pricing that our Bronco Top Hat [ph] would get. And obviously we already have a great scale for the actual industrial part of the product. So -- and again the platform has been very well executed. It has global scale as the C2 for the Bronco Sport. And so we see these and the pricing premium, we care in the utility market, the off-road market it\u2019s pretty well known and I would say very robust in terms of we\u2019ve delivered it. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s not a maybe. So for our standpoint, as Jim said, we not only replaced the focus in the case of rough on and Ranger, but we\u2019re coming off of very high scale platforms, C2 and Ranger. And we know that these segments executed right the product our premium segments. So we\u2019re feeling really good about the margin. Jim Hackett : And Jim, I just -- I want to sneak in, because you\u2019ve all seen our campaign about, we build more vehicles in America for -- by Americans in the whole industry. And this Bronco is, look, we\u2019re hiring people here in Southeast Michigan to build this product 2,000 to 3,000 additional people. So it\u2019s a -- I know I get teased about it because it came up in the discussion with the President, but I was just so proud to be able to explain that here we are in the middle of a pandemic with kind of challenges in the job market and Ford\u2019s going to be hiring people to build this product. So it\u2019s really a great news story. Dan Levy : Thank you. That\u2019s really helpful color. If I could just squeeze one more in on Elon just a question EV budgeting, at least as you spent half of the 1$1.5 billion electrification commitment to a 22 and I believe that the starting point was 16. So it\u2019s all us clearly your spend is more backend loaded. But obviously 2022 is not an end goal, and you\u2019re going to be spending EV, as you\u2019re just starting on the journey then. So is it fair to assume that if I assume, okay, so you still had $3 billion to $4 billion, $ 3 plus billion a year that the spend will only accelerate after 2022. So how to think of the electrification spend? Jim Hackett : Yeah. Jim, do you want to take that one? Jim Farley : Sure. Again appreciate your question. Obviously of the $11 billion we\u2019re at the very tail end of Mach-E and our two commercial vehicles. And they\u2019re really key for us, the commercial vehicles, the Transit electric and the F-150 electric. We\u2019ve announced the MEB and the number of nameplates and so you can expect in \u201822 and beyond as we refresh our product line up once again globally, that electrification will be a key component and so the spend will continue to play out. That figure was given a few years ago. So as you said, \u201822 seems like right around the corner, but, we\u2019re not done. And with the $11 billion, we have some really exciting products coming out like the F-150 and the Transit, and with the growth of package delivery and a large commercial customer network for F-150 we\u2019re are seeing a ton of interest from customers on both of those, but we have lots of passenger cars to come as well. We\u2019re not going to be specific more than what we\u2019ve shared, but I think you\u2019ve characterized it fairly and accurately. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First on South America, I would have expected your losses there to grow considerably in 2Q given a 75% decline in revenue, but instead profitability improves slightly. Now it looks more of the help was coming from price and cost, but how would you rate the progress of the restructuring in that region? Are there more cost savings to come from action\u2019s already announced, but not fully implemented and do you think you\u2019re at the point now that if the volume returned that you would already be profitable or are there more restructuring actions needed to get there? Jim Hackett : Well, I think, Jim mentioned this and Tim did is that South America, the journey there as compared to some of the other markets started. We phased out of unprofitable vehicles. We ended focused production and Pacheco exited heavy trucks business, discontinued Fiesta, ceased operations at San Paulo manufacturing based off the Sigma engine production. But Jim has been really working hard on the restructuring to serve a dealer network better in terms of our customers improving the availability for the remaining dealers. So I think this is a story that\u2019s still yet to be completed. But Jim, I want to let you answer why you think in the short-term we had this better than expected performance. Jim Farley : Thanks, Jim. The second quarter marks, I think, the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvements, although, still losses. And it really reflects, as Jim said, the progress that we put in place many years ago to restructure South America. We have a lot of cost containment. We\u2019ve taken a lot of headcount out of the business as you would expect. And we\u2019ve also in the second quarter took a lot of pricing, which is consistent with the currency situation down there. But I think allowing the team got ahead of the downturn we saw in the market with COVID that\u2019s been a big beneficiary for us for a while. As Jim said, we\u2019re going to keep restructuring our businesses until they\u2019re sustainable. So still more work to do. South America looks pretty challenging, but the team is doing a great job. We have a slurry of new products few years ago and there was costs associated with that. So I think we have a really good still fresh lineup. We gained a lot of share in the second quarter. It was down about a point from last year, but that was a lot to do with the vehicles that we discontinued. So the vehicles we do have are very well accepted. I just would portray it as we are not -- we have more work to do as Jim said, but really big credit to the team and way down revenues to have a third consecutive improvement in our profit or losses. Ryan Brinkman : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then just lastly, it seems like your market share in China is beginning to rebound of what would you primarily attribute the recovery to, was it the products, the relationship with Changan distribution strategy, localization of Lincoln, et cetera? And then are the pieces or future product programs in place to continue to grow that share, which I think had been like 4% at one point, is there a market share target that you have in mind that is materially higher than where you are now such that you could continue to grow your sales in that country even if the market sort of languishes for a while? Jim Hackett : Well, I\u2019m excited to tell you that the plan is working there. COVID was -- it kind of helped focus us, but the commercial vehicles strength was supported by a 34% increase in sales at JMC, which gained 40 basis points of share. And the second -- it\u2019s the second consecutive quarter of share gain of 20 basis points, which is whether you\u2019re hinting about. We were talking about it in a way that this was the breakthrough that we were looking for. I think, Corsair is the -- comes in the middle of this. It is the first locally produced Lincoln product and it breaks all records that we\u2019ve had in one month for the sale of a product like that. It contributed to the 12% increase in sales for Lincoln and now the new Aviator is following on. My only regret is that the whole Board was going to be there in October just kind of review the progress that you\u2019re noting and we can\u2019t travel now because of COVID, but Jim Farley and Anning Chen, our President there had done a really good job of getting our arms around that market. Ryan Brinkman : Thank you. Jim Hackett : Okay. Operator : Your last question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thank you. Good evening, everyone. So just a couple of cash flow questions maybe for Tim. I think year-to-date, the working capital and timing differences has been a use of about almost $5 billion. I am curious if you can share roughly how much of that you think you might be able to recover in the second half of the year? And then secondly to that with the CapEx down from the original guidance, we expect that to be recovered next year, meaning CapEx will be higher than normal, as you kind of recoup some of the deferrals from this year, Jim Hackett : Let me start with the last part first. Thanks for the question. We haven\u2019t completed our planning process for next year yet. We have said that for some time now that we\u2019re focused on fitness activities, which not only includes costs, but also CapEx to make sure that we\u2019re efficiently and effectively allocating capital. So we\u2019ll continue to focus on that, and you\u2019re seeing some of that reflected in the results on CapEx this year. So fitness, you also seen the ebb and flow of product programs, but we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making $1 million to $1.5 million down year-over-year, but again, nothing further to share at this stage on 2021. As far as working capital goes, bear in mind in the second quarter the working capital dynamics played out, we talked about production resumed, of course, during the shutdown period, we had payables who repaid and was production resumes as payables start getting no backup, but the restoration of payables continuing to the third quarter and that\u2019s one of the reasons we said that the third quarter cash will be better than EBIT in the fourth quarter cash with the shutdown seasonally and launches that are happening particularly F-150, this cash flow would be lower than EBIT. So I guess what you\u2019re seeing is not only the benefits from our fitness and our redesign and our underlying results improving in light of the COVID environment, but even underlying that, that\u2019ll continue to play out for the back half of this year and then into \u201821, as we\u2019re very keenly focused on all -- in all costs and cash opportunities. But as we\u2019ve talked about earlier, we\u2019re in a position now where we have a very strong cash position and liquidity position, and we\u2019re comfortable with outlook as we look ahead. Itay Michaeli : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And if I could sneak one more in, I\u2019m just curious, what are you seeing initially on the four promise campaign that you launched about a month ago. I am just curious if you\u2019re seeing a fair bit of traction there? Jim Hackett : Jim? Jim Farley : Yeah. I think, one of the really encouraging things for us leadership team, as Jim said, is we went out and promoted the reality that we\u2019re the highest employment in the U.S. of all the OEMs and, and also our volume in the U.S. and that plus new products is really, we\u2019ve seen a strengthening of our brand. The Promise campaign seems to do really well. We had a great second quarter in terms of share performance in the U.S. Retail, as Jim said, was way up full point, and part of that was mixed, but it\u2019s great to see that moment behind the brand. Third quarter looks not to be dramatically different. We\u2019ll continue to have good momentum, sales still lot to do. We have good supply situation and Ford in the 70-day range. And so the campaign seems to be doing really well, brands getting stronger, and we have product to sell. Itay Michaeli : Great. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn, I hand it to you? Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you so much Holly and welcome everyone to Ford Motor Company\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings call. Presenting today are Jim Farley, our President and CEO; John Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer and also joining us today for Q&A in Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit. Jim will have some opening comments, John will talk about our third quarter results and then we'll turn to Q&A. Our results discussed today include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Today\u2019s discussion includes forward-looking statements about our expectations and actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on slide 23. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year, company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is volume weighted. A quick update on our IR events over the next weeks. On Monday, November 02, Credit Suisse will host a fireside chat with John Lawler, Marion Harris and Kumar Galhotra, Ford's President of the Americas and our International Markets group and then on November 10, Stuart Taylor Executive Director of Enterprise Connectivity will participate in Deutsche Bank's auto tech virtual conference. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim Farley, Jim? Jim Farley : Thanks Lynn and hi everyone. First let me say how humbled I am and what a privilege it is to be the CEO of Ford. My family has been with Ford since 1916 when my grandfather started at Highland Park here in Michigan and in that moment our family story really started to change for the better and countless people over have similar stories about Ford. We're a family company. From the leadership a Bill Ford all the way to the members on our factory floor. I'm extremely motivated to help build a vibrant and growing Ford that will have a positive effect for generations to come, benefiting all of our stakeholders. Now we've assembled a very talented leadership team to get this done. A combination of strong, lifetime and long time Ford people who truly know our business, but we also have new colleagues. We had very different experiences and knowhow and talents to the company to execute our plan and we plan to continue to add to this bench with key capabilities in marketing, technology and many other areas. Over the past several months, I've spoken to many of you and I believe the plan we now have and have developed and are now executing on aligns well with many of your expectations. We're committed to creating Ford that grows profitably and generate sustainable free cash flow, led by our automotive business and we're going to allocate capital to the best and highest usage to drive sustainable value creation. Now that plan which was introduced to the Ford team and many stakeholders on October 1 is very straightforward. Among other things, number one we will compete like challenger, earning each customer with great products, but as well services with rewarding ownership experiences. Number two, we're moving with urgency to turn around our automotive operations, improve our quality, reduce our cost and accelerate the restructuring of underperforming businesses. And third, we're going to grow again, but in the right areas allocating more capital, more resources, more talent to our very strongest businesses and vehicle franchises. Incubating, scaling and integrating new businesses, some of them enabled by new technology like Argo, self-driving system and expanding our leading commercial vehicle business with great margins, but now with a suite of software services that drive loyalty and generate reoccurring annuity-like revenue streams and being a leader in electric vehicle revolution around the world, where we have strengthen and scale. So now speaking about EVs, to start with, we're developing all new electric versions of the F-150 into transit, the two most important, highest volume commercial vehicles are in our industry. These leading vehicles really drive the commercial vehicle business at Fort and we're electrifying them. We own work at Fort in these electric vehicles will be true work vehicles, extremely capable and with unique digital services in over their capabilities to improve the productivity and uptime of our important commercial customers. The electric transit by the way will be revealed next month and you heard about it here first for all of our global markets. We believe the addressable market for our fully electric commercial van and pick up, the two largest addressable profit pools in commercial are going to be massive and we're going straight at this opportunity. Together, we think the accessible price points of these vehicles, the productivity, the capability, the cost of ownership will be very compelling for some of our customers and frankly, Ford is not only in front of developing the electric transit in F 150, we also have an unmatched dealer base to provide that anywhere service or great uptime for our customers with a great customer base, with deep know-how on their usage and expertise in the commercial vehicle business such as the largest updater community there is, period. Also in the coming weeks we will deliver the first Mustang Mach-E to customers in the US and Europe. The reservations have been very strong for this vehicle and soon after it will go on sale even in China. Now 30 years of being in this wonderful business, I've never been so pumped up about one of our -- one of the retail vehicles. I recently had a chance to put a 1,000 miles on a Maki and that Mustang and that engineering team have pride -- had vehicle out of my hands. They just elevated experience the way it drives, the connected technology in the cabin, the ingenious cloud enabled services, it's all in the heart of the market from a price point. Such a large addressable market the two row crossover business and we have a real advantage especially in US with the EV tax credit. Now you're going to see our strategy of electrifying our leading commercial vehicles and our iconic high-volume products expand very quickly at Ford. It's also important to note there we're building out our electric vehicle manufacturing footprint around the world and we now have four plants in North America alone, including an all-new carbon neutral factory going up at the Rouge plant as we speak a few miles from here. We're also recently finalized an agreement with the Canadian Auto Workers Union, Unifor, that paves the way for future electric SUVs to be built by our team and for Canada. Now as we execute our plan, my commitment to each of you is transparency, including purposeful, measurable key performance indicators. So you can objectively track our progress. We plan to provide you with more details about our plan including financial targets in the spring. With that let me briefly touch on the robust third quarter and what we have on tap for the fourth quarter. When you look at our results, they reflect a benefit of our decision two years ago to allocate capital to our strongest franchises, namely pickups, a whole range of utilities across the world, commercial vehicles and iconic passenger vehicles. Additionally, we saw higher-than-expected demand for our new vehicles in the quarter. At a time when inventories are really low following the virus-related first-half factory shutdowns. Now that contributed to a very favorable pricing environment and mix. Together these factors plus the strong performance from the Ford -- the strongest performance from For Credit in 15 years led to a total company adjusted EBIT margin of 9.7%, that's 490 basis points higher than last year. As an outcome of all this, we generated $6.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Throughout 2020, even during the industrywide shutdown of COVID and as we prioritize the safety of our team, we've been disciplined in preparing for high-quality fourth-quarter launch, first of the 2021 F 150 to live in, you work in it, you can sleep in it. The Bronco Sport, the first of many Broncos to come and my favorite, the all new all electric Mustang Maki. In fact we use an unanticipated downtime to continue to validate the preparations for these important launch vehicles and in the case of the F 150, a methodical sell down and the changeover for our current model. While I'm proud of our team, I'm delighted to say that we're in good shape in important areas of readiness for these launches. Software, the hardware engineering is done, supplier manufacturing readiness looks great, in fact right now, are all new F 150s are rolling off the line in Dearborn as we speak and production will soon start at Kansas City and we're starting to build the Mustang Maki and the Bronco Sport actually early this week. Before I turn over to John, I want to thank each of you for joining us today. Despite the strong numbers in the third quarter, we know we haven't fixed the issues that held us back in our automotive business. They include warranty cost, which remain unacceptably high. I plan to be transparent and focused on both customer and shareholder value, proving out this business and are plan quarter after quarter, year after year. And now John let's take everyone to details. John Lawler : Thanks Jim. First let me say what an honor it is to be the CFO of this great company and you know I really can't remember a time when we've had this much opportunity to transform and grow our business and so it's incredibly exciting and delivering on that potential that's an important responsibility all of us have to our customers and to our stakeholders. Now to be clear, our transformation and growth plan is predicated on delivering an 8% or better adjusted company EBIT margin and consistently generating free cash flow, so we can invest in accretive, high return products and services and so my initial priorities to help drive this are one, help our team fix or dispose of underperforming parts of our business so we can allocate capital to its best and highest use and two, further strengthen our balance sheet. We will make the tough decisions to improve our financial flexibility and ensure that we have the resources to build and grow our business. Now let me summarize the third quarter. As Jim mentioned, we had a strong quarter delivering a 9.7% company adjusted EBIT margin. Now that margin was driven largely by higher-than-expected vehicle demand, positive net pricing and favorable mix as inventories were limited because of the virus-related shutdowns in the first half of the year. North America and China benefited from growth in both wholesales and revenue, while Europe, South America and our international's market group were still affected by COVID-related industry declines. In addition, our performance continues to benefit from our portfolio of refresh as we reallocate capital to our franchise strengths. Ford Credit also contributed, turning in its strongest performance since 2005, generating $1.1 billion in earnings before taxes with help from strong auction values. Now before I talk about the rest of our business, let me put our record $6.3 billion of adjusted free cash flow in perspective. Not only does it reflect the strength of our EBIT in the quarter, but as we indicated last quarter, working capital recovered sharply as we rebuild production to full capacity after a shutdown, largely driven by supplier payables. In the third quarter, the payable build was completed and this was worth about $4 billion. The strong cash flow in the quarter gave us the confidence and the ability to make a second payment on our corporate revolver, which we did on September 24. So now we have fully repaid the entire $15 billion facility and we ended the third quarter with strong a balance sheet including nearly $30 billion in cash and more than $45 billion of liquidity, which puts us in vital -- which provides us with the vital financial flexibility we need. Looking at North America, despite the difficult backdrop of COVID, the Ford team executed well operationally. We optimize incentives for lower dealer stock levels, we maximize production and skillfully manage supply chains to meet stronger-than-expected customer demand. The region delivered an EBIT margin of 12.5% as it benefited from top line growth of 8% EBIT improved by $1.2 billion supported by $900 million in net pricing and $400 million in favorable volume and mix. The improvement in volume and mix reflects the effectiveness of our team and focusing on Ford's franchise strengths. A few examples include S-series. S-series gained 1.7 points to a share of more than 35% in the US. Our mix of trucks and vans increased one point to 57%. Our mix -- our utility mix increased three points to 35% with a very strong showing from Explorer and the mix of cars declined four points to just under 8%. Now in total, North America share increased one point to 13.6%. In Europe, EBIT declined $300 billion in the quarter and that was driven by lower volume and about $400 million in costs related to our Kuga PHEV battery supplier issue. Those expenses included pulling cost that are required to comply with the EUs and new CO2 emissions standards this year. Now we said earlier that we anticipated meeting those new standards based on our product roadmap and the Kuga PHEV was a big part of that expectation. So we're working closely with our supplier to remediate the situation and minimize any inconveniences to our customers. We plan to notify our customers in the coming days on how and when we will repair their vehicles and had it not been for the Kuga issue, Europe would've been profitable for the third quarter. Now since Europe began its sweeping redesign of the regional business in 2018, the European team successfully rationalized the manufacturing footprint, shifted resources to our leading position in commercial vehicles and dramatically lowered structural cost. This year the Europe team is on track to deliver $1 billion of annual structural cost reductions. Now relative to mix, our commercial vehicle mix share increased by 50 basis points to 15.1% for the quarter and SUVs accounted for more than 30% of our vehicle mix in Europe nearly 9 points higher than a year ago. Turning to China, wholesale shipments in China were up 22% and that's the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth that reflects strong sales of SUVs and commercial vehicles. Our mix of SUVs increased 13 percentage points to 36% and that was driven by locally built Ford Explorer, Escape and Lincoln Aviator and Corsair with Lincoln delivering its best ever quarterly sales in China and as planned, over 65% of Lincoln vehicles are now produced locally following the introduction of the Corsair and the Aviator in the first half of 2020. Commercial vehicle sale mix increased, 5% five percentage points to 45% and that reflects strong JMC sale, up 38% versus prior year and that reflects the continued strong demand for light trucks, vans and pickups. So overall, the team delivered a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains and marked the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in EBIT, the best performance in three years. In South America, [audio gap] mitigating the ongoing pressure from inflation, currency and the industry structural challenges. And in IMG, IMG delivered a profit despite COVID-related industry declines in wholesale, which adversely affected the revenue. S-series gained share and our share with the Ranger pickup in Australia increased 6 points to 27%. Profitability in IMG also benefited from the work the team has done to lower structural cost. And finally, Ford Mobility, which is building fourth-generation autonomous test vehicles with the latest self driving technology, generated its first AV-related revenue from a fleet operations pilot in Austin, Texas, and at the same time, we are strategically expanding our spin scooter business in the US, the UK and Germany in generating strong revenue growth. Now before taking your questions, I'll make a few comments about the fourth quarter, which assumes no meaningful change to the current economic environment, continued steady improvement in the stability of the global automotive supply base and no further significant COVID-related disruptions to production or disruptions since the third quarter. Our guidance for adjusted company EBIT for the fourth quarter is between a loss of $500 million and breakeven. Now we recognize this is a big change both sequentially and year-over-year so I want to step through the key sequential drivers. First, we expect a reduction in wholesale of about 100,000 units associated with the F 150 changeover. Now this volume affect is a result of our measured production ramp-up plan to ensure that every vehicle we wholesale is gate released with the highest possible quality for our customers. Now to put this in context, the approximate 100,000 unit impact in the fourth quarter will far outweigh the effect of our UAW ratification bonus in Q4 of last year, which was worth about $600 million. Second, we also expect higher structural and other costs from the manufacturing launch activities for the Mustang Maki and the Bronco Sport as well as advertising launch activities for the new products, including the all-new bronco brand and higher material and other costs and we expect EBT from Ford Credit to be lower sequentially driven by strong but lower auction values and lower disposal at auction. With this fourth-quarter guidance, we now expect full year adjusted company EBIT to be profitable for the year. Other elements of our guidance for the year are unchanged with the exception of capital expenditures. We now expect a lower level for this year down between $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion versus $7.6 billion in 2019 and that reflects continued efficiencies. Before we move to Q&A I want to leave you with my key takeaways from the quarter. We had better execution, choosing word of play and our restructuring is paying off. These things intersected very nicely with the stronger-than-expected demand, we know there's more to fix and we're carrying on a clear plan to do that as Jim mentioned and our balance sheet is solid with nearly $30 billion of cash and over $45 billion of liquidity. Now operator, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from the line of John Murphy, Bank of America. John Murphy : Thanks for all the info and congrats Jim for leading the call here. Interesting stuff early days. Just a first question as you look at the strength in the third quarter, obviously there is great execution and some strategy around volume, mix and price that was held by good industry dynamics. I was just curious if you think about those three key factors once we get through the change of the F 150 in the fourth quarter and might bleed into your first quarter of next year, how much you think will reverse and as you look at what you're producing at the moment and your focus shifted next to a richer mix, how much of this stuff can be -- how much have been benefit of factors can be maintained going into 2021 or maybe just even on a run rate basis getting into 21 that would be great. Jim Farley : So went when you look at that and we look at the business this year really get into the core of the run rate a bit difficult as you can expect given going down in the first half and then coming back up and the launches we have for the quarter and so from a cost standpoint, we're going to continue to focus as we said on making sure that we can really leading into what we need to do to improve the business, improve the underperforming parts of the business and when it comes to the mix and the top line, we saw some strength there. We have winded our back due to the strong supply -- strong demand with the short supply. So seeing that going forward, we've been seeing our mix improve into our strengths of trucks, SUVs and our atomic nameplates and we continue to expect to push that, but as far as a run rate and what we see into 2021, we're not ready to talk about that at this point and we'll come back and will have more to say on that early 2021, we'll give you a read on the business then. John Murphy : Maybe to follow-up on that, how much of that you think is somewhat transitory for market factors, can you argue right now that the industry volume is pretty -- is relatively strong relative to the peers, but is not really in absolute terms quite and quite that amazing. So it seems like there is an underlying demand for stronger mix than we all may have thought since 12, 18, 24 months ago. So as you're going after this mix with this improved product, is there something that you see in the market just specifically even in the third quarter because it's really heavy stuff that you're running into real positive. Jim Farley : Yeah it is a positive, we see strength there. The question is, there was an imbalance in supply and demand and that gave us some of a tailwind, but we also are seeing over time as we've over the last two years made the concerted effort to shift into our strengths of commercial vehicles and trucks and you see that in Europe and you see that here. I see that around the world. So we do see strength there as far as how far that extends and what that looks like we're not ready to common now, but we do see strength there. John Murphy : Okay. And maybe just one last question on lease deferrals, how many recent did you defer in the second quarter that came back in the third quarter or might come back in the coming quarters and sort of envision when you see auction values I should say being very strong. How long do you expect that to continue because it just seems like there's a lot of positive news on these lease deferrals as well as what's going in these vehicle market that's helping out now just Ford Motor credit but the core new vehicle businesses as well. Marion Harris : Hey John, so this is Marion Harris. We did a bunch of payment extensions for loans and leases, but if you're referring to lease deferrals for lease ins where our unit comes back to auction, we didn't really do many of those and we had a pretty big inventory of used vehicles going into the third quarter and as we sold those units into an improving market, that's really what was the real benefit for Ford Credit. If you were talking about payment extensions though, of the we extended about 11% of our retail loan and lease portfolio and of that about 99% of those have already made a payment and we're back to pre-pandemic levels of extensions. John Murphy : Okay. So as far as what you're selling into the auctions right now, it's normal run rate of these returns flow into record auctions and no ebbs or flows or pulls by you. Jim Farley : That's correct. We're back in normal inventory. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Congratulations on the performance in the quarter. I hope it is the sign of things to come. I had three questions for you; number one, Jim you\u2019ve talked about 10% margin target for North America for some time and now you\u2019ve shown that you can get there obviously Q4 this one phase will be a bit challenging, but could you talk a little bit about what you're thinking about as the timeline for getting to that kind of a target more sustainably. Secondly, I notice that the warranty cost moderated a bit, at least the cost inflation moderated. Is that a sign that things are finally peeking and then lastly, the drumbeat of activity in notification obviously is something everyone's hearing and companies are laying out some pretty aggressive targets for cost reduction volumes. The Maki looks great, but it's still a relatively low volume product. Can you just talk a little bit about what your thinking is and how your thinking has evolved on what kind of volume you're anticipating or how aggressively you intend to move into electrification on some of those commercial products? Jim Farley : On North America, I think it's really important for us to be clear. Turnaround on automotive operations in North America needs to absolutely be at 10% plus. As you can see from the pricing and the mix, I think Ford is the strongest brand in the US industry mainstream brand on pricing and mix. Our issue in North America is cost and growth. On cost, it's really isolated to material cost, which is tied to that higher pricing of course and warranty. Our warranty in the last few years coverages is up $1 billion to $2 billion depending on the year and that is not okay. So although it moderated in the quarter and we have taken a lot of actions on craftsmanship, long-term durability, we have a much bigger ambition to improve the quality of our vehicles. We have taken a lot of countermeasures, they will take time, I'm happy to go into those if you'd like, but I would say our North America 10% is really a cost journey for us because on the gross side, we have a whole new Bronco lineup coming our brand new S-series coming. These are fantastic opportunities for us on the top line for the next many years to come. So our journey to get to 10% is a cost. On electrification, I want to cover that one next because it's very important. There's been a lot written about the electrification of our industry and Ford's bet is different. We're betting on a full lineup of commercial electrified vehicles. We're building a plant at the Rouge. We've been the number one nameplate in US industry. We sell over a 1 million S-series. We have an enormous customer base who are looking to reduce the cost and so I'm not going to get into forecasting the volumes, but we really see in this first inning of electrification and it'll be a long game that plays out over many years that we have tremendous volume opportunity. We are not going after the $100,000 plus market. These are affordable vehicles. They're in the price point in the US, the Maki, the $20,000, $45,000 and $70,000 two real crossovers, huge addressable market here in Western Europe and in commercial, we're not planning a very exclusive small 1% of the addressable US industry. We're talking about these vehicles being 10% plus of the revenue pool in North America at their price. So they look great financially for us. But I guess, we aren\u2019t looking at electrification for the propulsion. We think the real change here is the connectivity and to run a business based on the data. So the upgraded electrical architectures in the Maki and the F 150 electric to me is the most important because it allows us to reduce our costs inside the company and give customers totally different experience and your middle question. Rod Lache : Yeah the warranty costs, is this a sign that you're starting to get your arms around that and it's going to start that there is visibility on when that's going to start coming back down. Jim Farley : We have more work to do, that's all I'll say. We are not satisfied with the quality of run rate and may be coming down but that's not what we're targeting. We're targeting a fully competitive level of warranty spend on coverages and that's got lots of zeros next to it. To do that, Rod there's a couple things the team has decided to double down on. For suppliers who ship us van parts, we're to have punitive financial. If there are bad shippers for multiple times, we put more resources in our plants for supplier quality. We have a lot more resources dedicated and a ton of transparency on quality issues that are open for more than 30 days in the company. That's a key metric that we drive our management team to. So those are the kind of changes we made and I wouldn't say this quarter is anything that we're proud of. Rod Lache : And just to clarify Jim, you didn't really provide a timeline on getting to sustainable 10% or better margin. You said that you've got visibility on the revenue side and you still have work to do on the cost side. So is there a line of sight for you one on that? It seems like the product side and the revenue side for North America looks pretty powerful as you look out to next year. Jim Farley : Yes. Rod Lache : Okay. We'll follow-up offline thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner, Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Jim and John first congratulations on your new roles and Jim every encouraged by your commitment transparency and measurable improvements. So I guess in that spirit, when we look at I guess at your performance in the quarter, besides for the stronger demand pricing mix which you commented on, are you able to point us to measurable areas of underlying improvement that you\u2019ve seen whether it is on these material freight. You spoke a little bit about warranty on the structural side, anything that's really bearing some fruit that you're excited about or should we think about it more as a opportunity for the future. Jim Farley : When you look at that -- when you look at that cost performance for the quarter, you really look at what we talked about with Europe is all the restructuring they've done, the headcount that they've taken out, they're now approaching and they will approach this year that billion dollars of structural cost reductions. And so we saw that flow through that's coming through and that's going to continue to come through. What the team has done in South America in restructuring the business down there, getting out of low profitable vehicles, selling the Bernardo plant and all the actions they've taken on their structure and headcount, that's going to continue to flow through and then we saw good performance out of international markets group this quarter. They were profitable and a lot of that -- most of that was driven on the back of structural cost reductions. As far as what we saw here in North America, I think with the strength that we had in demand, the short supply, we saw one of our key focuses. Emmanuel Rosner : So I guess to get a little bit of color on what needs to be done on the warranty side and quality side, what is being done or can be done. I don't need a quantification, but just in terms of what does it require to get the material and freight, you show that's down, it looks like this is probably one of the two largest markets on the cost side here? Jim Farley : So thanks, thanks for your question. On the material cost side, it's kind of everywhere. A good example, we have a proximity, a key in your pocket to unlock the door and all four doors of the F150. When we look at the vehicle usage data, we found that people don\u2019t use the proximity sensor for the front two tours. We do not need a proximity sensor in the rear two doors. Our Jack on the F150 looks like it'll last about 50 years. That's not the case for our competitors. So it's everything from the way we package our features, the actual bill material and the team has been working through all these opportunities since February. We made progress but we need to make a lot more progress especially with the more expensive launch vehicles and I think the real enabler is going to be complexity reduction. We've been talking about complexity reduction as a company for quite some time as a key fitness for the leadership team, but we have a lot more work to do on complexity reduction and that will be a huge enabler for not only our manufacturing operations, but also our material cost. Emmanuel Rosner : And then finally, there was no specific guidance on free cash flow for the fourth quarter. I think in the last earnings call, there was that quarter financial be better than the EBIT in the fourth quarter worse than fourth quarter EBIT any sort of sense you can give us on this quarter's free cash flow and whether there will be some of timing on eCapital payback from the strength that we've seen in the fourth quarter. John Lawler : In the quarter we got payables back to what we would say is a normal run rate and so from a standpoint of the guidance on the cash flow for the quarter, for the fourth quarter it's going to frankly have said with EBIT it's going to be driven by EBIT. So we haven't given a specific number on that and at this point, I'm not sure we're going to do that today. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Thanks everyone. Jim I've got a few questions for you. I think you mentioned the freight that EVs look great financially I think when you're looking out that they seem to line up well financially. Could you elaborate on that? My understanding is that EVs present a really great opportunity to decomplexify the vehicle, even allowing for the expensive battery cost. So things that you can remove from an EV and that way you can design a lot more efficiently relative to the spiderweb of complexity of the internal combustion mechanisms that and it's a great opportunity. Am I correct in that assumption and I just didn\u2019t know I wanted to hear if you could add some color to that hypothesis? Jim Farley : I guess the three key messages for our electrification strategy, the companies were going after very large addressable markets and profit pools and were playing to our strengths, I'll come back to your question. The second is to turn battery electrics into a digital -- quite important for the company to transition as well. Related to the cost, initially several years ago when we made these investments and decisions, the cost of battery that the profitability the vehicle is really challenging, what we found since then, once we started to look at the real cost of CO2 of our internal combustion engine, when we started to look at in commercial terms offering bidirectional charging, bringing charging to the job site and electricity job site, we started to realize that there's a lot more revenue opportunity, a lot lower cost in marketing because of the connected services and of course the cost the way how the team looked at the cost of our battery, we used kind of a temporary overcapacity situation to get very competitive cost and also cherry pick the best chemistry out there. All that kind of team together with much more compelling financial picture for these first cycle products. I think that's what I was referring to when you look at all-in comparison to Ice [ph]. Also the revenue opportunity, we never really when we got into the commercial world of electrification, I think our eyes were very open and very informed by the aluminum investment in F150 that people are willing to pay in the case of light waiting, more than just light waiting fuel economy, it's a commercial vehicle for towing and payload. When you think about bringing energy to the job site or bidirectional charging for small medium sized businesses kind of a game changer for them in terms of for us to revenue. I hope that makes sense. Adam Jonas : Yeah it does and you seem to have for even before you became CEO, expressed a lot of enthusiasm toward the software services, the data opportunity for the company. I think you said you want to run that business based on the data. Can you be specific on what services get you most excited and when that could be material? Jim Farley : Great question. So first of all it starts with the talent. We attracted Alex Purdy from Deere who went through the whole Deere journey moving to software and data. We attracted Gil who is now our data analytics lead, we've had the talent on board for enough time. We really understand the opportunity. I think the opportunity first came Adam with internal of the company. You can imagine with our warranties, the data codes off the vehicle instantaneously having AI models analyzing all those data codes, how exciting that is to our frontline engineers, how exciting it is to have that data be available to all of our engineers on actually the bill of material and its usefulness for a company that has very expensive billing material. But then it became very quick for us especially when we got outside of Dearborn and listen to the opportunity on services that over the air updates that are really relevant to the customer in case of commercial. They run their businesses off these vehicles. So dynamic routing, telematics, driver coaching to drive more economically the people that have our small fleets, they just love this because they haven't had that data before and we can see a day, not too distant future with a full line up of pure better electric commercials. We have a whole service business and that service business is charging, its small enterprise solutions, small medium-size businesses, it's repair a more affordable repair and upgrade of this physical vehicle and that's what we're busy doing. That's our double transformation; one is to transform a automotive operations, the other one is in a way to kind of disrupt ourselves Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Ryan Brinkman : Thanks for taking my question, which relates to the upcoming F150 launch. Can you remind us of the timing and the impact you expect both in terms of the profit or margin headwind from the lower production during the changeover as well as the benefit to sales mixer or pricing subsequent to the rollout of the new version and how should investors think about execution risk during the launch? Can you talk about your confidence level there and I know that will go according to plan and what steps that maybe you're taking to mitigate the risk? Jim Farley : I'll answer the last question first on the product launch. We've spent a lot of time on these launches. It's very important as you understand and making sure we have all the design and engineering ready to go. We've made all the checkpoints and suppliers are ready, manufacturing is ready and we've started that production. We haven't discussed what we expect from a pricing standpoint or what we expect from margin standpoint of new truck and I don't think we want to talk about that today, but what we did talk about is the fact that we are taking a very pragmatic ramp-up plan to make sure that we deliver these with quality and that's leading us to have wholesales on a sequential basis down about 100,000 units and that's what's impacting the fourth quarter. But getting any deeper than that I am not sure we're going to get into that today as far as the pricing and the cost impact of the vehicle. John Lawler : And as far as the launch to complement John, we are so excited about this new F150 all-new powertrains that's towing best payload, it's the best 150 we very had and we do see the inside, it's incredible, the technology and customers are asking us for that. Look we've completed the design phase, the engineering phase, Howard and the team did a great job and we then finished the supplier readiness and manufacturing readiness. My whole leadership team and myself went to both plants personally to review the launches a couple times and we're now in high production starting the ramp-up curve at Dearborn and Kansas City. We expect to start soon. I think we don't know until we start getting up that ramp curve, what we're going to see but I'd say one of the things that will complement the Ford team how Linda [ph] cash the whole team was the way we use COVID. During the COVID shutdown, we didn't stop with the quality assessment of the launch and there was a lot of work done on the software specially. This is all new electrical architecture. There's a ton new software and we use that downtime to really prove out our capability and so we're a long way from declaring victory. It's a daily huge global team working on the F150 launch but we work through the launch so far. We've made a lot of progress as a team and now we're into mass production. So stay tuned. Ryan Brinkman : And then lastly wanted to ask about the strong net pricing that you've been enjoying in Europe and South America. Can talk about how you think your net pricing is tracking relative to the industry in those regions and is the pricing strength more a function of the success of your company specific product launches or are there other more macro factors that play for example as auto makers work to offsetting lower FX in South America etcetera. Where are you in terms of your product life cycles in these regions and how should we expect pricing to track going forward? John Lawler : Yeah. So let's just impact that a little bit, if you look at Europe, we've had a strong shift into our SUVs as we talked about earlier and with that has come pricing power relative to the other vehicle life and we expect that to continue in Europe. Down in South America, the team has been aggressive and you're seeing products shift there that's driving some of the net pricing as well, the strength in pricing because we're getting out of low profit, lower end vehicles and we're being very focused on driving towards higher margin products like Ranger and some of the other strengths that we have in the region. So we're going to see that continue through. And then in Europe they're managing through revenue management looking at everything we're doing the same thing here in North America. It's a focus we have and a lot of it's being driven by our strong mix. We are seeing some pricing for product as new product coming out and that's flowing through as well. So we're very focused on driving the top line as best we can, but equally and more focused on the cost as Jim has talked about as we've talked about, that's one of our main focus is keep moving forward on the top line and really hone in and focusing on getting the cost right. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Delaney, Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : Jim and John, you spoke to having urgency in achieving your goals, in altercation that includes an electric F150 in transit as few of the several electrified models that Ford is planning to bring to market over the next two years. I was hoping to better understand if the company plans to go beyond its $11.5 billion investment target in electrification as is previously articulated and does Ford plan to increase in particular number of bad models compared to its prior expectation? Jim Farley : I think the simple way to look at is, we're kind of in the first inning of this transition of the industry to battery electric future and we're deep into the planning for the second cycle of those products. Competitive reasons, we're not going to share the cycle plan with you, but you can imagine that we're getting more and more excited about electric future. Now we have some great ice products and we think that that market will still be robust, but we're making our bets on iconic retail vehicles and electric is deftly something that we're more and more excited about in our capitals following. We don't want to just be one of the many OEMs to transition to electric. We want to lead the electric change. That's why we're committed to Paris. That's why we're standing with California and that's our capital and we feel that the way we're doing it at Ford is the most important message, which is commercial and work. Those customers run their business on these vehicles. They're more attentive to cost of ownership, the vehicles of higher utilization and therefore the lower cost of ownership of operation is more important to them and they're especially interested in the data and so I think although we could talk about general investment levels, the key message from Ford is more the segments that we're investing in and that this is not a propulsion story. This is an investment in the digitization of our business. Mark Delaney : Thanks and you commented that because of the total recall, you're going to have a CO2 compliance cost this year. Are you anticipating a similar level of cost in the fourth quarter as was realized in 3Q and then perhaps more importantly, can you discuss if you think this issue will be resolved and is there risk to any of your other hybrid or better products? John Lawler : So from a cost standpoint, I'll start with that. As I said earlier it's about $400 million for the quarter. We do expect some cost in the fourth quarter somewhere between $100 million to $200 million. So that's the impact we see as it is today and that does also -- that includes the impact of the pooling effort that we're going to have to undertake for our passenger vehicle in Europe. Jim Farley : And the battery that is used in the Cougar PHEV is not -- so it's a supply [audio gap]. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Thank you and congratulations to the new Ford team. I want to drill down on the European CO2 compliance strategy both on the light vehicle side and the LCB side. So first on the LCD side, which of course as you identified to our different standards, is that on track and when can we expect an MEB derived LCV platform for Europe? Jim Farley : First of all, we have a great plan for Europe. We were on track for our CO2 target this year until the Cougar PHEV situation came up with the supplier late in the year. As I mentioned today it's a bit new news maybe not as dramatic as a $100,000 retail off-road, but the electric transit is a really big deal for Ford Motor Company. We're number one in the US, we're number one in Western Europe and we think electrifying this products has been really key and that will be a key part of our CO2 compliance announcement. So we continue seeing more city restrictions. Many, many of our small medium-size business owners are now asking for all electric solution and we also think the quality of the product will be a benefit for our European customers as well. The Maki will be are sold in Europe next year in volume and so we have a great plan next year with the Maki and we have a number of hybrids coming out next year in Europe and mile hybrids could be specific but we really have a great lineup in Europe over 20 models, but the leadership team really excited about Europe is the commercial vehicle business and the electrification of our high-volume van. Brian Johnson : I would concur on that. So moving over to the light vehicle passenger car and CV market, it struck assuming as a split of the pandemic with many viewing plug-in hybrids as a transition and million plus unit global EV platforms is the way to go. A, what's your thinking on that strategy and B, as we go into '21, '22, can you flex between BEVs and plug-in hybrids or even move to a more consolidated BEV platform for Europe. Jim Farley : I think the flexibility between battery electrics plug-ins is not very high. So we're really locked in as we should be. So I wouldn't -- this is not like vehicle mix or something like that. All the battery supplies are slightly different and also the lead time for changing battery capacity is a lot longer than most other major components in the vehicle. So I would think about those capacities in terms of flexibility very different than I would traditional ice power train. Brian Johnson : Okay. And finally can you disclose or can you disclose who the pulling agreement is with and will become a public record at some point in EU. Jim Farley : We're not going to do that today, thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Jim wanted to start out on a strategic question, on how you plan to balance the near-term industrial recovery, it's been a long cycle longer term transition to EV. How many and how you view the interplay of those two? Is piece of EV development that's regardless of the pace in your near-term recovery or should we look at pace of EV development by the extent of near-term recovery, so if you outperforming on your near term, you can accelerate on EV advice per se recovery? What's the interplay and near-term recovery in your EV development? Jim Farley : First of all for Ford, our plan is very simple, turnaround automotive operations, modernize the company and in a way disrupt ourselves, launch high-growth businesses like our CB services business or go to market customer facing EV business and so our calls on capital are much more complicated in just EV end vehicles. We have 15,000 software engineers at Ford right now and that will grow. So our calls on capital, our software, the credit company obviously, but increasingly it's these services businesses and we need talent, we need cash and capital to support them. It's all funded essentially by our core automotive operations and so the turnaround of automotive operations is not just a stakeholder journey. It's actually the lifeblood of our future because it funds everything and so how we look at it is getting out our automotive operations overseas to profit and then a solid sustainable return dealing with the issues of passenger cars in Europe and South America and India the three problem areas we've had in automotive and getting our North American operations 10% plus is an absolute minimum for the company to fund not just the electrification journey, but as well on move to services, data and software. Dan Levy : So help me understand as far as you have these larger cost -- capital call and presumably you have probably and then also it's nice to have it in terms of your investment. Does the pace of recovery at all impact the way that you accelerate or decelerate spend on those? Jim Farley : These are great questions. If you don't mind I don't -- I think it's best if we take a pass and we talk about this next spring. It is such a fundamental question you're asking. It is such an important question for Ford. I don't think the third-quarter earnings is the right venue. We need to take our time and go through this with you and all of the key stakeholders at Ford and I think you'll find it for all of us to be a lot wiser if we just take more time and we have specifics for you. Dan Levy : And then just a follow-up on the comp factors of growth, your focus on top line growth I think it's also clear at the same time you're likely willing to further sacrifice some of what maybe we can call global quality of more the commoditized pass card volume. So question is and we've already some structural volume decline in North America related to pass card in Europe as well, but did you give us a sense of maybe how much more we might expect to see volume decline in the coming years related to more commoditized products? Or maybe said differently, which region do you think there is more way to go or moving more commoditized that type volume? Jim Farley : Well thank you for your question. It's a very important one for us. After several years of making really tough choices, we now have the opportunity in North America to grow and I'll emphasize again that is something there I'd put in my speech and I think it's quite important for everyone to understand our ambition. As John mentioned, our share of SUV grew. Our mix of SUV grew, our car share is declining almost to below 10% now and our North America share increased one full point in the quarter and we have Bronco we've never had before. We have Maki that we've never had before and we're really excited about the profit potential for all those vehicles. So here we are on the eve of Ford Motor Company being able to execute well and grow in North America. When you look outside of North American, the growth that matters for us is commercial vehicles in Europe. The key growth metric for us in China we had an opportunity to grow again. We just localized the Explorer and the whole Lincoln line up. We haven't sold as many Lincolns that we did in September in 25 years and it's because of China. So we have a huge opportunity to grow China and we have an opportunity to grow to with export models coming from Mahindra and have to say we haven't talked a lot about this, but leak it out and that is we have some really exciting affordable products for North America that are going to help us grow profitably. So I think what you'll see is China and North America growth opportunities and the rest of the world we'll really focus on where we can win with Ranger, the commercial vehicles in Europe and you'll see us continue to grow these services businesses along the way. I hope if there is one message you'll get from Ford from this leadership team is that we're really trying to think everyone -- asking everyone to think about growth at Ford is more than volume growth. We want to growth our software business, our services business. Operator : And our last question for the day will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Maybe just two quick ones since we touched on a lot. I realize you are not talking about free cash flow for the fourth quarter but the Ford Credit EBT year-to-date is $1.7 billion, distribution $1.1 and I think you committed in the past defending all that out. So should we expect a catch up in the fourth quarter? Jim Farley : I'm not sure but I'm quite clear on the catch up is. I think that we've been distributing from Ford Credit on a regular basis throughout the year. So I wouldn't expect there to be anything out of the ordinary there. Marion? Marion Harris : Joe, the distributions from Ford Credit are going to reflect profit after tax, balance sheet size and leverage that it's going to be what's it going to be. Joseph Spak : And then just lastly John, I saw in the media I think made a comment about how it's too early to talk about the dividend reinstatement. I realize ultimately it's a board decision, but I'll this up I guess to Jim and John in each of your opinion should Ford give any dividend over the coming years given the transformation you're talking about and if so, what are really the parameters you're looking for, for reinstating that? Jim Farley : Thanks for the question. I don't think this is the time to have that discussion. I think we need to have that framed up in our total capital strategy and calls on capital and where we're headed as a business and I think next spring would be the time to do that. Operator : Thank you. That will conclude today's Ford Motor Company third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. We do appreciate your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Lastly, we continue to target late spring for our Capital Markets Day and we\u2019ll provide more details on that later. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim Farley. Jim? Jim Farley : Thank you, Lynn, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Last year was like no other, with COVID dramatically and often tragically affecting all of us. But tough times can bring out the best in people. And boy, was that true at Ford? I\u2019m really proud of how our people mobilized with speed and resolve to respond to this crisis. We harnessed our capabilities and we developed a lot of new ones. Our team members put others above themselves in both returning to work, but also to make life-saving equipment. And I\u2019d like to share just a few highlights of our pandemic response, including our new Finish Strong initiative to help limit the spread of the virus and save as many lives as possible until this pandemic is under control. To-date, Ford has manufactured 55 million medical-grade masks. And by mid-year, we will have donated 100 million masks. In partnership with UAW, we\u2019ve also produced 20 million face shields, 50,000 patient ventilators, more than 32,000 powered respirators in collaboration with 3M and 1.4 million washable isolation gowns. More to the point of today\u2019s call, we relied on the same grit and resourcefulness to deliver a very strong year financially under difficult circumstances. We improved our execution, while putting in place a specific and compelling plan, backed by some important early actions that are transforming Ford into a far stronger company, a company that competes and wins on behalf of our customers and other stakeholders in this exciting new landscape, which will be defined by electrification and connected customer experiences. After safely and smoothly restarting our manufacturing production in May, following last year\u2019s shutdown, we sharply rebounded in the second half of the year as we rebuilt our inventories to meet strong pent-up demand. In fact, we more than doubled our second half adjusted EBIT from the year before, yielding a 7.3% adjusted EBIT margin. In the fourth quarter, we successfully launched three incredibly important vehicles that exemplify our new Ford and our direction. Our first all-electric Mustang Mach-E, which we and more importantly others believe is the first credible mass-marketed competitor to Tesla; and the F-150, the 2021 F-150, America\u2019s favorite vehicle, it\u2019s now connected, you can sleep in it, you can work in it, it\u2019s incredibly capable and it is such a fantastic product; and the Bronco Sport, the first member of our reimagined legendary Bronco brand, which has generated as much excitement as anything to come out of Detroit in my career. Now, as we recap last year\u2019s results and discuss expectations for this year and beyond, I want to underscore that everything we do is in service of our plan. Simply put, we\u2019re seeing real improvements in our core automotive business and we are laser-focused on further progress this year. Now, this includes growing the company, generating consistently strong free cash flow for our core automotive business as well as Ford Credit. We will allocate that capital to its best and highest uses for creating sustained value. To achieve that, we are competing like a challenger now, earning customers and must-have products and services and rewarding customer experiences. We\u2019re moving with urgency to deliver leading quality, reducing our costs and restructuring underperforming businesses. We will start to grow again, but most importantly in the right areas, allocating more capital, resources and talent to take advantage of our strength in pickups, commercial vehicles and utilities, being a leader in the electric vehicle revolution around the world, where we have strength, but also where we have scale, expanding our leading commercial vehicle business with a suite of software services that earns loyalty and generates reoccurring revenue, and incubating, then scaling, then integrating new businesses, some of them enabled by Argo AI\u2019s world-class self-driving system. Today, I\u2019ll touch on a few of our plan highlights, with emphasis on capital allocation, electrification and connectivity. Back in 2017, vehicle lines had accounted for just 60% of our Company\u2019s revenue, generated a 150% of our EBIT and most of the vehicles generating that EBIT earned a multiple of the cost of capital. This imbalance was simply not sustainable and we immediately began reshaping and rebalancing our business. We allocated capital to our strengths. We jettisoned underperforming assets. We created a more focused portfolio, and built the financial flexibility to unleash significant untapped value at Ford. We\u2019ve already made a tremendous progress. Through last year, we\u2019ve invested $7.1 billion in EBIT and $1.6 billion in cash in our global redesign, reshaping our portfolio, our geographic footprint and our industry footprint. In the first phase of our redesign in Europe, for example, we prioritized profitable growth in commercial vehicles, where Ford is the number one vehicle brand in the region, but also a smaller, more targeted portfolio of passenger cars in the strongest segments, and exciting imports like Mustang and Edge that built our brand and make a solid return. We shrunk our manufacturing footprint in Europe, we reduced regional headcount by 20%, we lowered our annual structural cost by $1.1 billion through last year. And in the fourth quarter, Europe delivered its strongest quarterly profit in more than four years, achieving an EBIT margin of 5.8%. Let\u2019s turn to South America. We\u2019ve lost more than $4.5 billion over the last decade in South America, not acceptable. In 2020, we exited our non-core heavy truck business in the region. We discontinued Focus and Fiesta. And we further reduced headcount, in fact, by more than 40% through the end of last year. And with these actions, last year we posted the smallest loss in South America since 2013. And then in early January, we went further as Ford Brazil announced it would end production and close three facilities. That decision will de-risk our business by concentrating it on a more profitable asset-light model on our industry-leading Ranger pickup trucks, our Transit commercial vehicles and key imports. We remain committed to serving our customers in Brazil and South America, but now with the portfolio of exciting, connected and increasingly electrified SUVs, pickups, including this amazing new Ranger, and commercial vehicles sourced from Argentina and Uruguay and other markets. Now, we didn\u2019t take these actions lightly, and Ford is working with all of our stakeholders in Brazil to mitigate the impacts of these decisions. At the same time, we know they were right and necessary and we are optimistic about our new business model for South America. Now before John walks through the last year\u2019s results and how we see 2021, I want to update you on Ford\u2019s connectivity and electrification plans. 2021 is a strategic inflection point for Ford. We have hundreds of thousands of fully networked vehicles now in the field. And now, we\u2019re seeing the evolving institutional capability inside Ford to leverage that data streaming off those vehicles and also use our over-the-air updates to improve quality and revolutionize the Ford customer experience. And importantly, that means commercial vehicles too and customers. We have more than 100,000 subscribers to our telematics and commercial vehicle software business, we call Ford Commercial Services, and we are just starting. Ford\u2019s development and delivery of connected vehicles will be enhanced by a new six-year partnership with Google that we announced earlier this week. The two companies are establishing a collaborative group that we call Team Upshift to not only unlock personal consumer experiences, but to create and make the most of data-driven opportunities in our industrial system. The partnership will greatly enhance the Ford team\u2019s ability to innovate and deliver a consistent world-class consumer experience and as well provide Ford with a powerful technology and tools to modernize our manufacturing, our supply chain management and speed of our implementation of the data-driven business models and innovation across our whole company. Now, as I said a few minutes ago and many times before, Ford will be a leader in electric vehicle revolution around the world. We will do this in areas where we have strength and great scale. It\u2019s early in the transition, but the trend is clear. We watched one out of 10 vehicles sold in Europe in December be pure electric. EV sales in China continue to grow and the reality is the customers, including in the US, are increasingly giving E-mobility greater consideration. We have no intention to cede ground to others in vehicle segments, where Ford is the established leader. We are rapidly building on our electric vehicle plans and building out our manufacturing and our R&D capabilities. We\u2019re also increasing financial flexibility, so we can accelerate and flex to keep pace with the evolving EV needs of our customers. Now, the Mustang Mach-E, our first dedicated BEV platform, which last month was named North America Utility of the Year embodies how we lead in electric vehicles. It\u2019s on sale now, it has stunning design, is fully connected and ready for the over-the-air updates with a tremendous technology experience. It\u2019s delivering high-quality exceptional performance at a price in the mid-30s. It\u2019s a fantastic vehicle, which also happens to be a full battery electric, and there are many more dedicated BEVs like this one that are coming. As you know, Ford is a global leader in commercial vehicles and we\u2019re on the leading edge of the electric revolution there too. We are the first company to announce plans for an all-electric van and an all-electric pickup truck. With the E-Transit coming later this year, it has three different lengths, three different heights, we have a van, a strip chassis and a cutaway and there\u2019s more coming on E-Transit. And then we\u2019re going to launch the BEV F-150 in the middle part of next year. In a recent study by Cox Automotive, we -- they showed that the all-electric F-150 was the highest consideration rate and is the most appealing among major EV pickups that are coming to the market. Our successful Ford Transit franchise is a critical pillar of our electrification plan. We understand the needs of these customers, we\u2019re going to offer a wide variety of configurations dimension and we are developing not just the vehicles, but a whole suite of connected vehicles to serve them -- connected services. For instance, we know from our leadership position that the average daily route driven in a transit is 74 miles, and they do not overbuy batteries. We\u2019ve validated that with over 30 million miles of telemetry data from our Ford customers. Now with that data, we can forecast and optimize the battery life and provide over-the-air alerts, so when the vehicle needs service before anything fails for a 100% uptime, we can do that. That van stays on the road, working, where it belongs. Those are just two of dozens of examples of how we\u2019re employing and using data to help our commercial customers be safe and more efficient and to make more money, while at the same time creating an incredibly competitive advantage for Ford. The value proposition for our customers extends to customizing vehicles\u2019 interiors, digital experiences, E-service networks to maximize uptime and lower their operating cost. These are very sticky annuity-like capabilities that remove pain-points and create opportunities for our customers. No commercial vehicle provider is better positioned than Ford to innovate and introduce services like these at scale. We are accelerating our plans right now, breaking constraints, increasing battery capacity, improving our costs and getting more battery electrics into our cycle plan. We are now planned to invest at least $22 billion in electrification in the next few years through 2025. And that\u2019s just electrification. When you include the spending on our autonomous driving, our total commitment is at least $29 billion. The majority of our investment in electrification supports a widening portfolio of BEVs on platforms from both Ford and alliance partners. This electrification number does not even include the potential, of course, for vertical integration of battery production whether alone or in a JV. As the size of our ICE manufacturing footprint decreases, the scope of our dedicated global BEV manufacturing capacity is now growing. So far, we\u2019re busy and we have included a whole new facility in Dearborn at the Rouge to make the electric F-150, we\u2019re building the Kansas City facility for the E-Transit, Oakville, Canada for several battery electric SUVs and in China and Cuautitlan, Mexico for the Mach-E and there\u2019s a lot more to come. Our team is busy. Thanks for your time and attention. And as you can hear, I\u2019m very excited about our future. John will now talk about our results in more detail and outlook for the year. Over to you, John. John Lawler : Thanks, Jim. So, when you analyze our fourth quarter results, or even our second half performance last year, it\u2019s important to key in on the durable changes we\u2019ve made to our underlying earnings power, including in automotive business increasingly positioned to sustainably generate strong free cash flow. Right now, our year-end liquidity of nearly $47 billion provides the financial flexibility to opportunistically invest and grow and even accelerate investments if we choose to in key areas like electrification, in connected services and in our 8% company-adjusted EBIT margin, the target that we\u2019re aiming for, we believe we can generate healthy annual free cash flow to fuel our growth. When we initially set our 8% target, the secular forces accelerating today were still in their infancy. EV penetration at scale was years out, connectivity and digital services were still nascent, and autonomous vehicles, well, they were still largely in labs. So, you fast forward to 2021 and the landscape is vastly different and so are the calls on our capital. Our goal remains to hit the 8% margin and, in doing so, to reallocate profit and capital from a far healthier core business to exciting growth opportunities that will unlock long-term value. Let\u2019s take a look at the fourth quarter performance. In automotive, both wholesales and revenue declined by 9%, while a lower industry influenced both of these metrics, so did the planned changeover in North America to launch our all-new 2021 F-150. Our initial estimate was for a decline of 100,000 units, and we came in right on that number. Fourth quarter revenue benefited from broad-based gains in net pricing and product and series mix, especially in North America and Europe. Let\u2019s take a look at our individual regions in a bit more detail, starting with North America. The North America business offset some of its decline in top line metrics with continued growth and an increase in mix of commercial vehicles. Together, volume and revenue of Transit and Super Duty vehicles were up 14% and 24%, respectively. With the launch of the new F-150 now complete, we\u2019re building every vehicle we can. EBIT was $1.1 billion, up 53% with a margin of 4.9%. This growth was driven by excellent yield management and the non-reoccurrence of the UAW contract cost of fourth quarter of last year, all of which was partially offset by the lower F-150 volume I mentioned. In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 15% and 10%, respectively, reflecting industry softness and Ford share losses as we refocused our portfolio on strengths in Ranger pickups, Transit van and key imports. On a full year basis, Ranger gained 1.8 points of share to 15.6%. Revenue performance in South America was better than wholesale as we took aggressive price actions to offset inflation and currency pressures. As Jim mentioned in 2020, we exited our non-core heavy truck business in the region, discontinued the Focus and Fiesta and further reduced headcount in total by more than 40% through the end of 2020. These actions and other actions that we\u2019ve been taking contributed to the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in regional EBIT, and we posted the smallest loss in South America since 2013. With our recent announcement to exit manufacturing in Brazil, we have fundamentally de-risked this portion of our business and delivered another significant milestone in our global redesign. Shifting to Europe. Europe wholesales and revenues were both negatively affected by lower industry volumes. However, Ford\u2019s revenue in the region was up modestly aided by higher net pricing and improved mix. Our commercial business in Europe strengthened its number one position to a 14.3% share, which is a gain of 70 basis points. Ford has the broadest network of commercial vehicle dealers in Europe, including close to 800 dedicated transit centers. And during the quarter, the commercial, passenger and import vehicle businesses were all profitable. And the reduced manufacturing footprint that Jim had referenced along with the $1 billion decline in structural costs over the last two years allowed Europe to deliver its strongest quarterly profit in four years, with an EBIT of $400 million and achieving an EBIT margin of 5.8%. Now, turning to China. China delivered a 27% increase in wholesales. Retail sales grew 30%, outpacing the overall industry sales growth of 12%. Ford\u2019s share in China grew by 40 basis points to 2.4% with a 12 point increase in the mix of utilities to 36%. The mix of commercial vehicles reached 45% in the quarter supported by strength in light trucks, pickups and other vehicles. Importantly, our dealer network return on sales remains positive. Now while it\u2019s still a modest EBIT loss, this was China\u2019s third consecutive quarter of year-over-year profit improvement aided by an enhanced mix of vehicles, including locally-built Lincoln products. The China-specific Lincoln models accounted for 76% of the brand\u2019s in-country retail sales, that\u2019s up from just 2% last year. Wholesales and revenue results for the international market group varied, but its retail sales increase of 1.8% countered an industry decline of 3%. IMG continues to capitalize on its strengths in Ranger pickups and Everest SUVs, and Ranger was the best-selling 4\u00d74 pickup in Australia. And just this week, we announced a $1 billion investment to modernize and upgrade our Ranger pickup plant in South Africa, an important low-cost export hub that supplies 100 markets, including Europe. This paves the way to significantly expand production for the next-generation Ranger starting in 2022 and profitably grow this important business for us. Excluding the impact of India, IMG was profitable in the quarter led by Australia and Vietnam. In December, Ford and Mahindra jointly decided not to complete a previously announced joint venture. This outcome was driven by the fundamental changes in global economic and business conditions caused in part by the global pandemic. While we continue our independent operations in India, we are actively evaluating alternatives and reassessing capital allocation for India. Turning to mobility. We now plan to invest at least $7 billion in autonomous vehicles through 2025, including the $2 billion we spent through 2020. Our plans include standing up our commercial AV business by 2022 to move both people and goods, and we also believe that Argo AI\u2019s self-driving system remains on a shortlist of leaders in the autonomous technology. With improving unit economics, we continue to grow our Spin scooter network, which has become more relevant in a COVID world as people explore alternative modes of transportation. In fact, indicative of the strength of our city relationships, Spin won the overwhelming majority of all scooter permits it applied for in the US in the municipalities last year. Now let\u2019s turn to Ford Credit. Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, with EBIT up almost $300 million to $900 million, a record fourth quarter. Improved auction values drove the performance and we continue to experience strong credit performance with a low loss to receivables ratio. All told, we delivered $1.7 billion in adjusted EBIT in the quarter, up $1.2 billion with an adjusted EBIT margin of 4.8%, which was up 3.6 points. Considering how the first half of 2020 unfolded, I\u2019m incredibly proud of how the Ford team came together to finish the year with such strength, setting a firm foundation for this year. Let\u2019s turn to 2021. The global semiconductor shortage situation is fluid and we\u2019re evaluating and updating the potential effects on our business in real-time. We want to be transparent and also prudent. Therefore, we think it\u2019s premature to size what the ultimate impact will be on our full year results. That said, we ended 2020 having achieved positive lasting change in the underlying trajectory of our earnings power, including the ability of our automotive business to generate consistent levels of strong free cash flow over time. For 2021, we were on a course to earn between $8 billion and $9 billion in adjusted EBIT, including a $900 million non-cash gain on our investment in Rivian. That scenario anticipated continued EBIT improvement in each of our regional businesses, except for South America, which we expect to be flat through their transition this year. We anticipate mobility to be flat and Ford Credit EBT to improve. We also expect to generate between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. However, the global semiconductor shortage is creating uncertainty across multiple industries and will influence our operating results this year. The situation is changing constantly, so it\u2019s premature to size what the shortage will mean for our full year results. However, right now, our current estimates from suppliers support a scenario, where we could lose 10% to 20% of our planned first quarter production. If that scenario is extended through the first half, this could adversely impact our full year adjusted EBIT by between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, net of reasonable cost recoveries and some production makeup in the second half of the year. So, we should expect full year cash and EBIT effects to be about equal with quarterly cash implications more volatile given the mechanics of the company\u2019s working capital. So, our team is working with our suppliers around the clock to optimize the constrained supply, minimize the profit impact, while also prioritizing customer orders, new vehicle launches and compliance with our CO2 emissions regulations. For example, similar to other actions we\u2019ve already taken, we are adjusting shifts next week at our Dearborn Truck Plant and Kansas City Assembly Plant. These actions are contemplated in the 10% to 20% scenario for the first quarter volume that I just mentioned. We will provide you with an update on the semiconductor issue when we report our first quarter \u201821 -- 2021 financial results, and that\u2019s on April 28. So, before we open the call for Q&A, I will end where Jim began. It cannot be overstated, 2020 was a year like no other, no other in our life times. The Ford team responded exceptionally both personally and professionally. We\u2019re exceedingly proud of all of our colleagues around the world. We made tough, strategically sound decisions in 2020 that have created durable beneficial changes to our underlying earnings power, including an automotive business that is increasingly positioned to sustainably generate strong free cash flows. And that financial flexibility will allow us to make the right investments for long-term profitable growth and value creation. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : It looks like even after adjusting for the Rivian gain, you're guiding to 2021 profits well above consensus, presumably helped by the volume, pricing and mix benefits of a number of highly anticipated new products, including the new F-150, the Bronco, Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-E. I know you have a lot of confidence in these vehicles. But are there any objective measures that you can share with investors as to why they should also be confident in the profit contribution of these models? So I know it's early days. But do you have any anecdotes about how quickly the vehicles are turning on dealer lots? How the pricing has been trending for the new F-150, what the earlier customer reaction has been to the Mach-E? Or you're doing a lot of test drives? And I realize the Bronco still has yet to even launch. So maybe there are fewer metrics there. But maybe you could tell us a bit more about the waitlist, for example, whether it continues to grow or how trim levels or options have been tracking relative to expectation or what the general community response has been? Jim Farley : Thanks for your question. Just really quick on the F-150, some of the metrics -- objective metrics, we see that give us encouragement is, obviously, we're starting the year at a day supply level that we haven't seen for a long time. That's one thing. So a lot of opportunity to build wholesale and dealer inventory into the year. We're starting the year with 53 days supply. The mix of high series, which is always a big indicator of demand for the vehicle, is about 20 points higher than we normally see in the outgoing model. So, Lariat plus mix is extremely strong. You also look at the super duty demand. Super duty was up 14%. It had a great improved vehicle, but I think the F-150 improvement is even bigger. And even during the sell-down and the start-up of the new truck, that demand is -- we're turning vehicles in 6 days, the F-150. If you turn to the Mach-E, really good demand so far. We have about 70% of the customers are new to Ford. So we have new to Ford being they haven't owned a Ford for 15 years. The cross-shop vehicles are Porsche Boxster, Porsche 911, Mercedes E Class. We're also seeing in the reservations as we turn them into orders. High all-wheel drive mix more than we thought. The extended battery is much more popular than we expected. And don't forget, we have 127,000 federal tax credits that are each worth $7,500 each, and that is a big advantage on the pricing side. So really strong demand, early orders for Mach-E.  On Bronco, obviously, the Bronco Sport is turning, I think, in like 6 days. We sold every one we wholesaled to dealers in the fourth quarter. I think we sold over 5,000. It's just like the F-Series turning incredibly fast, Ryan. And I would say the Bronco, we're now just shy of 200,000 reservations, and we're now starting -- in a little bit, we'll turn those into orders. The encouraging thing about Bronco is just the interest. Not only do we have a lot of orders and confident in reservation, but the mix is stronger than we thought. It's encouraging to see the 2-door B3 a third but the Ford orders, very, very strong mix. And the demand is at the dealership levels or even our reservation system are really, really strong. And I think we could pass some Bronco Sport in January. I think we passed 8,000 units. So I mean -- and that's a brand-new model to our lineup. So that gives you a picture for the demand side. And maybe, John, any comments about the rest of performance? John Lawler : Yes. I'd just say, Ryan, that when you look at it, Jim went through the portfolio transformation, but the global redesign is really starting to take hold in de-risking the business. We're starting to see some strength in China. The localization of key project -- of products there, Lincoln, for sure, improving our cost structure there by localizing. We're leveraging capacity at the JVs to build Lincolns and commercial vehicles. Our partnering to share investments and improve scale, you saw that with the South Africa announcement we had building the Ranger and a VW pickup now in that facility. So I think we're starting to see strength across all the areas we've been talking about. But we're also focusing on the basics of the business, right? We've renewed our focus on our quality improvement. We're leveraging all of our connected vehicles to identify issues faster, improve our warranty expense, improve our ownership experiences. We're also leaning into electrification now, as Jim said, with Mach-E being on the road, the E-Transit coming, the F-150 BEV next year. And we're really transforming the team as well. We're bringing in new talent. We're organizing ourselves to grow our core businesses and expand that through connectivity and digital services. And so when you look at all of that across the business and you start to see some of the strength take hold, it gives us confidence in the year, and it allows us to move forward with the confidence we're projecting. So I think there's a lot of good things going on here. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : I just wanted to ask a question, Jim, just around the transition to EVs and maybe using F-150 as an example, to maybe talk around. I mean, when do you think sort of the tipping point is for the consumers, where they see enough EVs on the road that your ICE vehicles become somewhat obsolete and [depresses rigids] [ph]. And how do you kind of work through that transition? And specifically also around the F-150, I mean, can you position this as a performance enhancement, particularly around torque for trucks that you can actually get paid a tremendous amount of money for kind of like you did with EcoBoost, I mean you can joke on an EcoBoost, it wasn't really fuel economy that people love, it was a low end torque, right? I mean -- so I mean, just what's the tipping point where you kind of get hit a little bit on your rigids, on your outgoing ICE vehicles? How do you manage that transition? And how do you think about your position in EVs? Jim Farley : Thank you for your question. It's stunning how fast the industry is changing. I watch the market really carefully in Europe and 10% in December. Pure battery electric is amazing. Our time is now at Ford. We're not talking about aspirations. We committed to California and Paris Accord and carbon neutrality a long time ago when it wasn't easy, and I'm very proud of that. This year, as you mentioned, we're launching Mach-Es in the market now. We think it's a real competitor to Tesla and their stronghold part of their price market. The F-150 electric is a lot of inbound interest from our loyal customers. We sold 780,000 F-150s last year. We are going to find, and we are finding, within that, a duty cycle that matches electric for some of those customers. It's such a large scale. In Transit Electric, the inbounds on that vehicle are really high. This is our turf. And we're not just going to have 1 delivery vehicle. We're going to have 3 lengths, 2-wheel bases, 3 roof heights, a cut through, a cabin chassis and a van and we're not done. So we are the leader in the Transit business. We have the body builder connections. 100% of our transits get updated. And we know every one of those of updaters. So -- and we are getting more inbound for that. So how do we manage the move? I think it's a really good question. I don't know if any of us have the answer. The costs are coming down quickly. But for me and the team, the move to electric is not about batteries and motors. It's about digital vehicle and a new customer experience. And that is universal, whether it's F-150, ICE or a battery electric, that digital experience that we're talking about, we have 130,000 commercial solution customers now. We have 9 million Ford Pass customers, that is universal. So that's goodness that we'll get back in all of our business. We just have to be very flexible, which we have those large commercial vehicle manufacturing facilities that are very flexible. And we'll invest in both. And we'll flex with the customers. So I think we're ready. This is our year. We're going to have great offers. And I think it's really on us. The real proof point to me is not going to be how many we sell in the first year. It will be how much better the vehicle is a year or 2 after we launch it with the same customer. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolf Research. Rod Lache : So $22 billion is a pretty huge commitment to EVs. I was hoping you can talk about the level of volumes you're aspiring towards. It sounds kind of like a similar commitment to another company that's targeting about 1 million units. Can you talk about your Ford's cost competitiveness and the trajectory of costs for EVs? Do you agree with these expectations of cost per kilowatt hour declining to the $55 to $80 range in 5 years? And then lastly, in the context of what you said earlier, Jim, about allocating capital towards businesses that have strong returns. Do you think that by 2025, you can achieve similar profitability and returns in EVs that you achieve in ICE? John Lawler : Hi, Rod. Well, clearly, we need to see improvements in cost structure, similar to what you've been talking about in that 55 to 80 kilowatt hour for the pack. And that's going to happen over time, and we definitely are pushing in that direction. And that's going to be required. We're going to see the ICE and the BEV converge as they transition. And yes, we do see them being profitable. In fact, Mustang is profitable today, the Mach-E. So it's going to transition over time. We're deeply focused on driving that cost structure down on our BEV vehicles. We're leaning into our strengths where we see some synergies and taking advantage of that. So it's definitely a focus we have. From a standpoint of the $22 billion commitment to EV, as Jim said, as we lean into our strengths, we're focused on BEV. We're focused on expanding that growth. We're focused on the digital experience and the customer experience with those vehicles. And as that transition takes hold, over time, we're going after the larger segments, right? These are segments that we lead in. There's a strong customer base. And with that, as Jim said, there's duty cycles. There's specific needs for these customers with these vehicles. And we're going to continue to work with them to give them the solutions they need from a battery electric standpoint. But at this point, we're not going to guide on a number of volume and by when at this point. Jim Farley : And Rod, I think just a compliment, John, expect us to be a lot more specific in spring as we move on. It's just -- this is not the right venue to go over specifics. But please rest assured, we are really excited to share all the specifics of our BEV plan. We just want to give you an idea of how we're allocating the capital. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Just one question. You mentioned a couple of times the landscape is quite different now than when you first laid out that timeline for 8% EBIT margins. And now you're significantly stepping up investment, which is objectively a good thing. So I know you're still targeting that level. But is the timeline shifting? John Lawler : Yes. What I can say is that we are continuously putting pressure on ourselves to pull that timeline ahead as quickly as possible. And so it is shifting. We're focused on it. We're focused on improving the business as quickly as we can and continuing to invest in our growth areas. We see a stepped-up improvement in 2021. You saw that in the guidance and outside of the chip issue. And we're going to continue to work that. And as we do move closer to that 8%, we achieve those targets, we're generating good healthy free cash flows that we're going to invest in the business. So yes, we are putting tremendous pressure on the team to move that forward and achieve that as quickly as we can. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Jim, I'd like to ask a question on partnership because if we think about the tenure of Jim Hackett, it seems like one of the core focus is really on building out partnerships, and I think we saw with VW, Mahindra, Zotye [plug-in]. But when we look at how things have played out in recent months, I know we've seen you terminate plans with Mahindra and Zotye. It seems like vehicle with Rivian has sort of been deemphasized. But on the flip side, we also see you forming this partnership with Google. So all in, wondering how you expect to use partnership as you're setting your agenda? And specifically, I'd be curious for that view as it relates to EV? Jim Farley : Thank you so much for your question. This is a fundamental approach that we all committed to and continue to be committed to. We love what RJ is doing at Rivian. It's a strategic investment. It's not a transactional investment for this or that. And so we'll keep you updated. But that's a very fundamental bet and it looks like the market is liking what he's doing, too, which is good for Ford. The partnership with Google is very fundamental. It goes far beyond -- we want our team working on things that will differentiate us. Google has got a great platform for navigation and content delivery, and we can co-create on top of that. And their -- the system is great, but we're going to use Amazon Voice, and we're going to work hard with Apple on CarPlay. And we're going to have a great relationship with Microsoft on commercial vehicles, which we will tell you about some other day. But our partnerships in the technology area, including the Chinese partner -- technology firms, is just going to get deeper and deeper and deeper. And as far as our relationships, our partnerships, they will change with electrification. And you should expect more work in that regard. Anyways, I don't think you're going to have to wait too long to hear more about that actually. So it's a fundamental approach. The technology partners are becoming more and more important for us to deliver that digital experience, but also to build the capability inside the company for large-scale AI/ML deployment to our industrial system, the customer experience, using that data off the vehicles for quality improvement. And we don't have all the answers. And these companies can really help us, and we can help them. I hope that makes sense to you. Operator : Our next question is going to come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : So one follow-up question on the increased spending in -- towards electrification. I understand you're not prepared to give specifics, But directionally speaking, I'm curious if you can give us color on what you were trying to achieve with it? I guess, how will this be spent? And what is the goal here? Are you developing a dedicated, flexible architecture for all your electric vehicles? Are you accelerating the rollout of electric vehicles? I guess, I'm just curious how this will be used? And a point of clarification on this as well. So your slide into -- and your presentation implies that you will focus on the areas that where you lead all these pickups, your sales from commercial vehicle seem to have some sort of commercial angle to it. Will your electrification strategy be mostly aimed at commercial customers? Or will you have also high-volume passenger vehicles? Jim Farley : So thank you for your question. The answer is absolutely. This accelerated spending on products and industrializing those products. And we recognize in the guidance for explaining that, that there's more spending to come on our battery vertical integration decisions. We just don't have anything announced today. We have -- I'm not going to get into it, but we have 2 battery electric dedicated platforms. They will include high-volume passenger cars. But as we've always said, we're going to invest in the segments where we're the strongest. And you can imagine what those nameplates are and what those segments are. And we will have a great lineup of commercial battery electric vehicles. And as well, importantly for me, is the investment in the digital experiences and the physical services to make that work. We've learned over all these years that Ford\u2019s strength in commercial is far beyond the product. In fact, the product is often regulated to be defined as it is. Our strength is our distribution network. Our ability to keep vehicles on the road. Our upfitters, our bailment policies, and all of those strengths will come to bear as we electrify those lineup. And we have more ambitions, as you can see with the FCS software business. That business is growing very fast. It's a telematics and commercial services business. And that's a good example of the kind of investments we're making beyond the four-walls of the product. So as we electrify, we're not just going to bring more products, we're going to get more digital and we're going to get into physical services and digital services as well. But they'll be in the nameplates in the segments that we have a great reputation. As John said, we have a good owner base. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Jim, so first off, I just have to say the Mach-E kicks ass. I've rolled up -- and Lynn can tell you, she shamed me. I rolled up in my Y, I spent a half hour in the saying, I got back in the Y and I have to admit I have some regrets. I miss it. This thing is going to sell superfast, so bravo to the team. My question is on cell supply. What's your latest thinking on making your own cells or JVing with someone or pure outsourcing? And I ask this, Jim, because as you can understand, many of us on this call, right, can see a situation where we have a potentially dramatic misalignment between -- basically where demand massively exceeds supply of cells, and this really could threaten the commercial targets of an OEM\u2019s EV volumes unless you get this sorted out. Please tell me we don't have to wait until late spring for that. But let me know where your head is. Jim Farley : All right. Appreciate the feedback on the product. And to me, the real test for our fitness on Mach-E will be, as I said, how that product performs, its range, its capability, its quality, a year or 2 from now for that same customer. Adam Jonas : It's got a lot of character. It was a ride. And I wasn't even driving the GT. It was a lot of fun. Jim Farley : Oh, that's the key. I was just going to say where do you see the GT. Look, our first inning -- if this is a 9-inning ball game, our first inning, I think we played it about right, which is to buy the best technology at the lowest price out there during what you could argue in this first inning was an excess supply batteries. But now the game is changing. And the next step is going to be a much more aggressive electrification plan and the subsequent impact on our battery strategy, and we cannot afford to be in the situation we are with semiconductors right now, which is a good metaphor for what you're bringing up. So you can expect from Ford, follow-on this battery electric commitment, more news on our vertical integration plans. And there are options. We could do it ourselves. We can go to a JV and as well out there, not too far away, it's a solid-state technology moving very quickly. There's a lot of bets to be made. This company -- this team is in the midst of making those. And we'll let you know as soon as we can. But we get it. We want to lock it up. We want to make sure it's not a constraint. And we also want to pick the right technologies and the right partners at the time and have the flexibility as well as the technology changes, like solid state. I don't know -- we can't give you a date right now, whether that will be the spring or tomorrow. But please understand, we totally get the issue and the opportunity. Operator : Our last question for the day will come from the line of Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. Philippe Houchois : I've got 2 questions, 1 for Jim and 1 for John. Jim, on this alliance with our relationship with Google is interesting, and we had Renault do a similar arrangement 2 weeks ago in Europe. If I stepped back a few years ago, I remember Google being seen as the enemy and the company that carmakers had to stay away from the -- avoid seeing Google getting to the car. What has changed? Is it just simply that you looked at the cost of developing software and you feel like it's too complicate too costly and then Google is a better solution to bring that connectivity to your customers? Or has the willingness to find commercial arrangements with Google improve in terms of revenue sharing, for example, that made working with Google maybe less threatening than it might have been a few years ago? And then for John, I was just wondering, if -- you're the first OEM to give us some guidance on the impact of semiconductor shortage on earnings, and thank you for that. I'm just trying to understand, you guide for the impact -- what the impact could be in the first half. Let's assume things normalize from the third quarter. How much of that negative impact in the first half would you be able to make up in the second half? Or should we think there's a net loss that we should take into account into our earnings forecast based on what you've given in terms of guidance? Jim Farley : So to be really direct about your question, probably 3 things really changed our mind -- or not changed our mind but got us to where we were. First of all, it's not an exclusive relationship. So we want CarPlay to work great in all of the vehicles. We want Amazon Voice products to work great in our vehicles. But the Google, 3 things really changed to answer your question or evolved. The first one was, we just -- the money we were spending to keep competitive on a generic experience in the vehicle versus what they could offer in a stable, robust platform, the economics just work better. And we could take our team and instead of doing generic capabilities, we could put them on really differentiation. And we found that in Mach-E. If you use the Mach-E, we call it the Menlo systems, we really started to understand that if we had a stable digital platform inside the vehicle, we could really out co-create and create better, deeper experiences for a Bronco customer or Mach-E or a commercial customer. So basically, it was their commitment to build and to dedicate resources to a really good digital ecosystem in the vehicle. The second one is that we really started to feel a lot more comfortable with our customers' data and how that would be protected. And that's really important. Ford is a very trusted brand. All the data will be held and managed by Ford, Google won't have access to the Ford customer data in the cloud. The third thing was their cloud. We're trying to move our enterprise and a lot of our compute into the cloud very quickly for cost and capability. And we think their cloud is really competitive, but so is Amazon\u2019s, those Microsoft\u2019s. But we also saw that they were willing to make a commitment on AI and ML, I mean we are already using AI and ML throughout our company, but we need to really accelerate that. And they have real resources, and we're willing to make the commitment. So those are kind of the things that really swayed us. I hope that makes sense. But it's not necessarily exclusive. And we really are excited about the subscription business and the digital experience that could come off of this and all the other bets we're making with the technology companies. John? John Lawler : Yes. Thanks. So the scenario we laid out is based on the discussions we've been having with the supply base over the last couple of weeks, and it's very fluid. And we know that it's an industry impact. And what we see is that we could lose between 10% and 20% of the planned first half production. And so when you take that on an annual basis, the impact of that full year could be between $1 billion and $2.5 billion. And like we do, and we did -- like we do and like we did with COVID, we've assumed in there some reasonable cost recoveries and our ability to recover some of the production in the second half. And so the net impact on the year would be between $1 billion and $2.5 billion, depending on where this falls out, relative to the production disruption in the first half. And that's why we tried to frame it up to give a scenario around what it could be because it's very fluid right now. And as we get through this quarter, in April, we'll be able to share more details. We think we'll have a lot more understanding of exactly how this is going to fall out. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we would like to thank you for dialing in for today's Ford Motor Company Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call.

These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, which can be found along with the rest of our earnings materials at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussion includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Slide 24. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year, company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is volume weighted. A quick update on our upcoming IR events. I'm very pleased to announce that we will hold our Capital Markets Day on Wednesday, May 26. The webcast will open at 9 :15 am and we will start promptly at 9 :30 Eastern and end roughly at noon. We will share more information about the meeting later on this call and invitations will be sent out shortly. On Monday, May 3 Wells Fargo will host a fireside chat with John Lawler and Kumar Galhotra, President Americas and International Market Group. And on June 17, Deutsche Bank will host a virtual fireside chat with Jim Farley. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Farley : Thanks, Lynn. Hello, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us today. Our first quarter of the year really defies an easy explanation or a pithy sound bite. But if I had to sum up one way, it would be this. We're executing on our plan. And I'm excited to say Ford is becoming a stronger, more resilient company that can deliver under pressure, manage risks and seize opportunities, all while generating consistent returns for our stakeholders. In the quarter, we earned $4.8 billion in adjusted EBIT. It's our best quarterly adjusted EBIT ever. And we achieved these results in the midst of a persistent global pandemic, and an unprecedented supply shock tied to the global semiconductor shortage. We mobilized the global team as we always do in these times of crisis. And we rapidly adjusted to the realities that we were seeing. Our team very skillfully navigated the supply constraints, through sharp yield management, and a relentless focus on turning around our automotive operations. That means improving our launch performance, improving our quality, enhancing our brand, strengthening our customer relationships, and improving our go-to-market execution. And Ford Credit, which in our view, is the best automotive finance captive in the industry, also delivered an outstanding quarter. Aided by higher prices, our results benefited from the industry-wide imbalance of supply and demand, given the semiconductor shortage. However, we also delivered improvements that will persist over time, including our global redesign in our overseas operations, which contribute to the largest swing in year-over-year profitability for those operations that we've seen. The benefit of our incredibly fresh portfolio refresh, which lowers the average showroom age now in the U.S. to just three years. And, of course, we made progress on cost across the business. As we share with you today, there are more white waters moments ahead for us that we have to navigate. The semiconductor shortage and the impact to production will get worse before it gets better. In fact, we believe our second quarter will be the trough for this year. We have worked to do to get our industry footprint back to firing on all cylinders or maybe should I say fully charged. Overall, though, I'm proud of the progress we made as a team. As our underlying strength at Ford improves, enhances our cash flow, access to capital, gives us financial flexibility to modernize and disrupt our business while investing in growth. We are very intentional about this because these are the catalyst factors that will transform Ford into a form of vibrant company that will deliver not only our iconic must-have products, but also and I would argue more importantly, and always on ever improving customer experience for both our retail and commercial customers. So let me share a few milestones from the quarter. Turning around auto. Over the past four years, our overseas markets lost a total of $5.8 billion in EBIT. This quarter, the regions delivered roughly $500 million of EBIT, that's a $1 billion improvement year-over-year. Let's look at those must-have services and products. We'll start with the new F-150, which gained share and also gained share of revenue. And it had new innovations like Pro Power Onboard, which showed again, that we understand Ford customers afford these truck customers better than anyone. And the Bronco Sport is off to a fast start bringing 60% new customers to our brand. The new Mustang Mach-E is proving to be a hit with customers just a few days on lot with very strong demand in North America, now in Europe and coming to China. And it's also bringing in new customers to the brand, almost 70%. And we still have the Big Bronco, the two and the four door with incredible order bank, the F-150 Electric and the E-Transit, and we have some surprises for you as well. Stay tuned. Just as we are in the early stages of our electric vehicle plans, we're only scratching the surface of our customers benefiting from our fully connected vehicles. We have successfully deployed our first major over their update software updates to hundreds of thousands of customers for Mach-E and F-150. And this pace will only accelerate the next several years, making our vehicles better over time. Later this year, for example, we will offer our very first tested \u2013 fully tested Ford BlueCruise hands-free driving technology, which will be delivered over the air to Mustang E and F-150 customers. And by 2028, we expect to have more than 33 million over the air updated capable vehicles on the road. Now this installed base gives Ford a significant opportunity to develop products. And for us, very exciting new services that will transform the way we deliver products to our customers. They'll make significant improvements to our customers\u2019 experience and drive quality of our vehicles. And we're on track to lead the electric revolution in areas of Ford strength. For example, we announced we're investing $1 billion in the new electric vehicle manufacturing center in Germany, where by 2023, just a few years from now, we'll be assembling our very first high volume all electric passenger car for Europe. A year later in 2024, all Ford Europe commercial vehicles will be zero emissions capable. And by 2030, all Ford European passenger cars will be all electric. Now these investments are part \u2013 just part of our $22 billion commitment to lead the electric revolution in areas that we're strong. And yesterday, we announced a very important new development. We have formed a new global battery center of excellence called Ford Ion Park, which will accelerate our research and development of battery as well as battery cell technology, including future battery manufacturing. This only starts to hint at our electric vehicle ambitions. There is so much more to come. Now before I turn it over to John, let me share a bit more about where we and the industry are in semiconductors. When we initially gave guidance in February, we expected that the semiconductor supply chains would remain constrained through the second quarter. And we have an opportunity to begin recovering lost volumes in the second-half. It\u2019s kind of played out similar to that with one big exception. The industry faced another setback on March 19 when Renesas, a leading semiconductor supplier, who manufactures about two-thirds of all chips in the auto industry, experienced a significant fire at their Naka 3 facility. Multiple Tier 1s who supply global OEMs sourced their chips from this facility, including nine Tier 1s who supply us at Ford. Now Renesas expects, it will return to full capacity in July and they're making great progress. While most of the chips for our modules for this facility are definitely dual sourced, Ford and others are facing additional constraints. And we've yet to see significant new chip capacity come online for our industry. Estimates project the full recovery of the auto chip supply will stretch into fourth quarter of this year and possibly even into 2022 making industry volume recovery in the second half of this year even more challenging. As you can imagine, we are working this issue 24x7 and engaging with key political leaders and decision makers globally, as well as of course our supply chain. Ford relationship with the new Biden administration rests on our distinctive profile that we assemble more vehicles and have more US auto jobs than any other competitor. It's also well recognized that Ford sided with California on greenhouse gas regulations when that wasn't the easy choice to make. So from COVID, PPE to the current semiconductor crisis, to batteries for EVs, this past year has vividly spotlighted the importance of improving domestic supply chain for both our industry and our country. Now we found the White House and the new cabinet engaging, accessible and responsive. We look forward to continued close working relationship as the country formulates policies to facilitate the transformation from iced above and finally address infrastructure deficits. As you would expect, we're committed to learn from this crisis to be a much stronger company. We're taking this opportunity to revamp our supply chain to eliminate vulnerabilities down the road. This is especially relevant as we consider not only semiconductors, but also battery cells and other commodities critical to our modernization and transformation. We're also learning as we operate in this extraordinary low stock high demand environment in the US and around the world that we will see a leaner, more efficient company in the future, we're getting more fit. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to John. John Lawler : Thank you, Jim. So heading into 2021, the run rate of our business was on track to deliver 8 billion to 9 billion in adjusted EBIT and that's up about 33% versus 2019. And that, of course, is all before the impact of global semiconductor shortage. So our confidence in the stronger run rate is built on the durable changes that we've made to improve our returns, improve our cash flow and of course provides us financial flexibility to invest in growth. And these improvements were embedded in our original 2021 outlook. So for example, after shifting an overwhelming majority of our capital to our franchise strengths like trucks and utilities, we refreshed our product portfolio, we lowered our average showroom age and shifted our mix to our higher margin vehicles. And as a result, relative to 2019, the increase in our average transaction prices in the US was $1900 more per unit than the industry average. Now, also the tough choices we made to redesign our overseas businesses started to turn the tide. Rationalizing manufacturing footprints, strengthening the product portfolios, focusing relentlessly on cost and investing in areas of growth and strength are now producing results. Another item we've also talked to you about is warranty. Over the last three years, our warranty expense is increased by more than $2 billion. Now, we've addressed this issue through changes in design, how we inspect vehicles, how we work with suppliers on quality, and now how we're using connected data to identify issues early in the process and drive quality improvements. Now, this quarter, we delivered a $400 million improvement in warranty expense year-over-year, and we're intent on accelerating this positive progress. So these are just a few - three of the many examples of how the trajectory of our business is changing and what gave us the confidence when we set our original targets for 2021. Now, let me turn to this quarter. Wholesales declined 6% and in most cases that's due to the chip constraints. Now despite the declines in wholesales, revenue grew 6% aided by higher net pricing and favorable mix. We delivered 4.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, and an adjusted EBIT margin of 13.3%. And as expected, adjusted EBIT, including an investment gain of 900 million from a Rivian funding round that they had in January, so that was included as well. And then adjusted free cash flow was negative 400 million. The global semiconductor shortage reduced our planned Q1 volume by about 17% or 200,000 units. And that's consistent with the 10% to 20% range of expected losses that we shared with you in February. In Q1, we fully offset the EBIT impact of the loss volume, but we reduced incentives as part of the industry wide response to tight dealer inventories and that's especially in North America. We optimized the mix of our production to build our higher margin higher demand vehicles. We also reduced our structural costs in areas including manufacturing and advertising. We improved results in our FCSD parts business and in our joint ventures. And we benefited from strong used vehicle prices in Ford Credit as customers and dealers drove up demand for used vehicles as new vehicle supply sell. So some of these improvements, like the lower manufacturing costs and the robust pricing improvement, we do expect those to moderate as the industry returns to full production and dealer inventories rebound. Now, our adjusted free cash flow in the quarter of negative 400 million was significantly lower than our 4.8 billion of adjusted EBIT. Now, there's three main factors that contributed to this gap. First, our gain on Rivian was non-cash. Second, in the quarter, we grew inventory by $2.2 billion. Now, this includes parts for vehicles we could not build due to the lack of chips, but it also included approximately 22,000 vehicles. Those are primarily in North America that are awaiting installation of chip related components and so some of this inventory impact though was offset by a growth in payables. And third is timing differences. Now, this primarily relates to the reserves for customer allowances for incentives and warranty. This reserve - that reserve fell by $1.6 billion in the quarter. The vehicle incentive portion is based on the number of vehicles awaiting sale and dealer inventory, and the expected incentive per unit and both of those fell in the quarter due to the supply disruption. Now, we do expect that working capital and the timing differences to normalize as the semiconductor supply is restored, if dealer stocks rebound and incentives return to more normal levels, and we believe this process will take several quarters and will most likely extend into 2022. Our strong balance sheet provides considerable flexibility to navigate times of stress such as this chip shortage while also investing in growth. So we ended the quarter with over 31 billion of cash and 47 billion of liquidity, which includes our recent 2.3 billion convertible issuance. We will continue to be very proactive in managing our capital structure. Overall, our business units did a fantastic job prioritizing newly launched products, making sure that we process customer orders and high margin vehicles quickly. And that was all in a supply constrained environment and the strong customer response to Mach-E affirms our choice to shift more capital for best, including investments to in source key elements of the value chain necessary for competitive and sustainable profitability. So let me share a few of the highlights from the quarter. In North America, wholesales declined 14% while revenue increased 5%. Revenue was aided by strong net pricing and favorable mix, robust customer demand for our new product portfolio, tight industry wide inventories and favorable cost performance on a year-over-year basis and that included warranty. All of that helped us deliver 2.9 billion of EBIT and a margin of 12.8% which was North America's highest margin in five years. In South America, wholesales and revenue declined 70% and 40% respectively, and that reflects the exit of unprofitable products. The renewed focus on strengths like Ranger, Transit and key imports drove our best quarterly EBIT since 2013 and our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement. In Europe, wholesale declined 4% as revenue grew 13%, aided by improved product mix, led by our commercial vehicles and net pricing. These actions together with our continued focus on cost delivered 341 million in EBIT with a margin of 4.8%. In China, China delivered strong growth in both wholesale and revenue. EBIT was about breakeven, which marked the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement, supported by strength in Lincoln, Ford near premium utilities and commercial vehicles. In fact, Lincoln now produces 90% of its products locally, was profitable, posting its best ever Q1 retail sales, nearly doubling its share on a year-over-year basis. And commercial vehicle sales were also strong and now comprise 48% of Ford's total China sales. In IMG, growth both wholesales revenue - grew both wholesales and revenue as they focused on their franchise strengths of Ranger and Everest. And IMG achieved its best quarterly EBIT, reflecting strong cost performance, net pricing, and favorable exchange. All markets in IMG were profitable except for India. And IMG also committed to invest 1 billion to expand Ranger capacity in our South Africa export hub to meet customer demand in more than 100 global markets. In mobility, our AV business continues to invest in refining its go-to-market strategy. It added a new 140,000 square foot command center in Miami and along with Argo AI is simulating ride hail and delivery across six cities. And I'd be remiss not to highlight the continued strength of our Ford Credit business, which delivered 1 billion in EBIT in the quarter. Now turning to guidance, as we entered 2021, we were among the first to identify the potential for a 10% to 20% adverse impact in volume in the first half of the year, due to the growing chip constraints. We said at that time that this risk had the potential to reduce our full year adjusted EBIT by $1 billion to $2.5 billion. That would take us off our original target of 8 billion to 9 billion in adjusted EBIT. We've updated our outlook to include the expanded impact of the global chip shortage, and that's largely driven by the Renesas fire. While the situation is a significant headwind, we have definitive actions to address a full range of potential outcomes. So we now expect to lose about 50% of our planned Q2 production, an increase from the 17% loss in Q1, making Q2 the trough for our performance this year. Now, while we expect the flow of chips from Renesas to be restored in July, we and many in the industry now believe the global shortage may not be fully resolved until 2022. So our outlook now assumes we lose roughly 10% of planned second half production. In total, we believe the shortage for the year will drive a loss of about 1.1 million wholesale units, which translates to about 2.5 billion EBIT. That headwind - and that headwind in EBIT is net of recovery actions for the year. Now this EBIT impact was the high end of the range we gave in February, and brings our full year adjusted EBIT guidance range to between 5.5 billion and 6.5 billion. And it's very important to highlight that even though our expected volume loss for the year has more than doubled. We have worked to contain the EBIT in back to the high end of our original range. But we now also expect full year adjusted free cash flow of 500 million to 1.5 billion, and this includes a 3 billion adverse impact from semiconductors. The semiconductor impact on cash is 500 million worse than the impact on EBIT due to timing differences and the working capital impacts that will recover once a run rate of production is fully restored, dealer stocks return to more normal levels and incentives rebound. Our Q2 free cash flow will be significantly negative. And that's despite additional Ford Credit distributions driven by our adoption of the updated tax accounting standard, which reduces our tax allocation of Ford Credit and supports additional Ford Credit distributions. However, we expect our cash and liquidity to remain healthy throughout the year, providing us with considerable flexibility to manage the present situation. And this supports our growing confidence in the resilience of our business and our ability to effectively navigate the challenge just as we navigated the COVID related production disruptions last year. So now I'd like to turn it back to Jim for a few comments about the Capital Markets Day. Jim Farley : Thanks John. Before we turn it over to questions, I want to reiterate how proud I'm with this Ford team for its commitment to deliver on our plan, to fix automotive, to modernize the company, and to find ways to disrupt our business and the traditional auto industry to create value that will be rewarded - that will reward our stakeholders. On May 26, we will hold a virtual presentation for investment community where we plan to deep dive into our plan as Lynn said. We're going to cover how we're going to lead the electric vehicle revolution in areas that we're strong at Ford. Number two, we're going to build out our industry leading commercial vehicle business with products, but as well services that lead to growth and new revenue streams. And we're going to leverage our connected vehicles to transform the customer experience and truly shift Ford from a more traditional OEM to a company where the manufacture and sale of the vehicle is just the very first step, and then ever improving always on and far more rewarding customer experience. I so look forward to speaking to all of you soon as we continue our effort to create a Ford that can compete and especially win in this exciting new era of our industry. So with that, let's start the Q&A. Operator : All right. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Hi, everybody. Can you hear me? Hello? Operator : Yes, we can hear you. Rod Lache : Okay. Look, I wanted to just maybe get a little bit more clarification on the guidance. I think everybody understands that the underlying guidance ex the semiconductor shortage impact isn't really changing. And I don't think anyone would react to that at all if it wasn't for how surprisingly strong Q1 was. You almost did $5 billion of EBIT, including the gain and $4 billion excluding it. So the numbers obviously are going to be pretty low for the rest of the year. I guess my questions on this are, was there first of all, an unusual gain on incentives for inventory at dealers in Q1? Could Q2 actually be as low as Q2 of last year? And then even more importantly, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about whether we can extrapolate anything from these kinds of numbers that you did a double-digit margin in North America, 5% Europe looks like some pretty good warranty improvement. So when the dust settles, what do you think we can pull out of this as we think about 2022? John Lawler : Yes. Hi, Rod. Thanks. Good afternoon. That's a lot there. Let me see if I can unpack that and do justice to the question. So as you said, the run rate to the business is $8 billion to $9 billion. And without chips, we clearly believe that's where we would be. And I think you're seeing come through the quarter a combination of things, as I said, in my remarks, you're seeing the strength of the underlying businesses improving and you're seeing that come through. You saw that in the redesign of our overseas operations. You saw that in warranty expense improving, right? Those are two things that we said we needed to improve in our business as we move forward through the redesign, and you're seeing that come through. You're also seeing the strength of our new products. Now, it's a little opaque, I think, for people to say, well, you also saw considerable pricing opportunity because of supply and demand imbalances. That is true. But so we go back and we look at what's happened with the pricing for our products, since we started the redesign, the refresh. And that's where we come back to. Since 2019, if you look at our price increases, our average transaction price increase compared to what's happened in the industry, our transaction prices have increased $1900 more than the industry. So that strength is flowing through. Now we had additional pricing opportunity in Q1 due to the supply demand and - supply and demand imbalance. And so that hit the quarter as well. We also saw a very strong mix in the quarter. As we had lower production, so we optimized the production to our higher margin and higher mix vehicles. So we saw that flow through as well. So you're seeing that combination happen and impact as in Q1. Now remember for the year, as we go through the year, we're also going to see a significant headwind from commodities. We saw very little commodity impact in Q1. That's because we still had our contracts from last year in place and we had our hedging. And so as we go through the year, we expect as contracts roll off, and we've seen the commodity prices increase primarily for aluminum, steel and in precious metals, we expect to see about a $2.5 billion increase in commodities Q2 through Q4. So that's going to hit us as we go through the rest of the year. We also won't have the non-recurrence of the $900 million Rivian gain. And we also expect that as we go through the quarter, and we get to more normalized levels of production albeit we said 10% lower in the second-half, we should start to see more and a gradual normalization of those incentives that we experienced in the first quarter the benefit of that. And then at Ford Credit, we did benefit again in the first quarter from the strong residual values and we do expect those to moderate as we go through the rest of the year. So we've taken all that into account as we've gone through. And I'd have to say that, what's encouraging to me and what the team has been able to do is we've been able to maintain the impact of the semiconductor chips to that high end of our range, the $2.5 billion, despite the volume impact growing significantly. Rod Lache : Yes. Thanks for that. Could you maybe - just to ask this a different way, the $8 billion to $9 billion guidance, excluding the semiconductor impact, that includes things like the inflation from commodities and so forth, it does include Rivian as well. But maybe you could just speak to at a high level, can we think about that $8 billion to $9 billion is kind of a launching point, if we wanted to think about bridging to next year? Is that sort of the run rate of profitability for the business? And there's obviously adjustments in warranty and South America restructuring, new product and things. Maybe you could just speak to that and how we should be thinking about the run rate of profitability? John Lawler : Absolutely, that is the run rate leading into next year. And we still have new products, Bronco, coming this year, the two and four door. We have some surprises Jim talked about, we have the F-150 Electric, we have the Transit Electric. So we have more products coming next year. We're going to continue to be aggressive. Our cost structure pushing that. And the other thing that we're learning coming out of this situation that we're in is how do you operate in a lean environment? And we've learned some quite a few good things about operating with leaner inventory. So I think there's opportunities there as well as we head into 2022. So absolutely, the eight to nine is a launching pad, we see that as a launching pad into 2022. Rod Lache : Okay. And just lastly, it sounds like there's some permanency to this transition to the lean inventory sales model. Could you speak to what kind of changes you're expecting here to distribution? John Lawler : So we've been doing quite a bit, of course, to get customers vehicles, to move people to more on order process, we've made changes to our processes to lower the gap between the time and order goes into the time we can deliver the order. And we're also seeing that as we look at making these types of changes to modernizing or improving our processes in a lower inventory environment, you get benefits across the patch, right? It would allow us to have lower capital required at Ford Credit, if we have to finance less dealer inventory for our dealers. That could free up some capital to invest in other growth areas. We would see better quality, because we'd have fresher vehicles and vehicles wouldn't be sitting on classes long. We'd have improved dealer profitability, because they wouldn't be financing that floor plan and we'd have lower incentives. We believe we'd have low incentives, because we'd have quick returning vehicles and we'd have higher orders. So as we're working through this lower inventory and these opportunities that we're seeing today, we're working on how we make them a normal part of our business as we go forward. Rod Lache : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is going to come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good afternoon, everybody. I just wanted to follow-up on that line of reasoning. I mean, you guys are kind of apologizing in some ways for the good environment and what it's kind of forced you into in this lean inventory situation. Obviously, let's forget about the second, third and fourth quarter because they're going to be disrupted by the chip shortage. But I mean, you're seeing and you saw us in the third quarter of last year, these incredible margins, particularly North America, and then with the international one second, but that's being positive. I mean, you're kind of rolling off this list of things that have happened and that you may be able to maintain. Why wouldn't you maintain them and maintain this supply demand balance or imbalance as you call it, but really some people might say it's a great balance, and really focus on the higher mix vehicles and drive similar performance. I mean, we just seen it happen third quarter, fourth quarter, there was some launch costs, but you saw it happen in the third quarter, you saw it happen in the first quarter. I mean, why would it - why would you let it reverse? I mean, and obviously, there's some industry dynamics that are - other people are in the - other companies are in the same situation, but you yourselves are controlling this - can control this going forward on your product mix and what you do with your own production and it's produced wonderful results. I mean, why would you let it reverse? Jim Farley : We won't. Hi, it's Jim. I want to make it really clear John. That's not our intention. We're a smart team, we're running our business responsibly and there's real goodness here. This is - personally 10 years ago, I saw this industry go from 30-day supply way back up to 100 in 10 years, we're not going to let that happen. This is a better way to run our business, it's even more important now why? We get to move online. We get to use a reservation system with customers for most customers, when products are lean. We can simplify our sentence, we have the most complicated go-to-market system, I think on planet Earth. We could simplify all of that with tighter inventories. And it's better for the fitness. It also requires our industrial system to be more responsive. So no, I want to make it extremely clear to everyone, we are going to run our business with a lower day supply than we have had in recent past because that's good for our company and good for customers. John Murphy : Okay and investors too, which is important. And I guess as you think about the experiment or not the experiment of what you're executing in South America of backing away and putting just a few vehicles - supply a few vehicles into that market, it seems like Europe and China are kind of heading in that same direction. I mean, are you learning - I mean, I know its early days in South America, from that business plan. And I mean, and we're looking at Europe, that will be centered more around commercial vehicles, with maybe just a few easy passenger vehicles, and then China, which will be mostly Lincoln, and maybe some commercial vehicles. And then IMG, which is the Transit and the Ranger and that's it. And we'll see some stability in these international regions that hopefully will be profitable, but we won't always kind of be running around freaking out about whack a mole in one of the regions blowing up on us. It just seems like you're getting a handle on South America, you getting handle on these other regions. I mean, is this slimmed down product offering and maybe smaller size with more stability and better profitability really the direction that you're heading in these international regions? Jim Farley : Yes, we had a billion-dollar swing year-over-year. We've been at this for a long time in Europe. We're entering a new phase in Europe. So John, absolutely, the focus in Europe is in commercial vehicles and passion specialty passenger cars. In international markets it's the Ranger and derivatives of the Ranger. And in China, there's a - China like North America will have a more diverse product range than the other markets. But let's be really clear, we're doubling down on our iconic nameplates and building out a family of products. We just localized Explorer in China, it's doing great. Lincoln is profitable. I mean the growth rate in Lincoln in China and the profitability improvement as we localize to 90% as John said, it's been very encouraging to us. So in China and North America, we'll focus on these really passionate segments, where we think we naturally do well. But the big change is not just improving the profitability by simplifying where we compete. The big change in the company is going to be investing to an always on relationship with the customer. That is the real change at Ford. The change of simplifying our lineup and focusing on markets where we can be profitable is necessary. It's the important foundation. But what's sufficiency for us is to evolve into a different model with the customer. And you'll hear more about that in Capital Markets Day. John Murphy : It's great and just quickly on FMCC, obviously, reserves are probably going to stay stronger this year. I think you're probably being a little bit conservative there on your expectations. But if you also once again think about this focus on mix and price and not over producing, the net beneficiary also is FMCC. You mentioned the balance sheet being potentially a little bit smaller in the future as you can do more with less maybe everywhere. What is FMCC going to look like and I think we know, traditionally kind of think about $100 billion balance sheet. But it sounds like it might be somewhat smaller and have better returns and maybe more stability in it where are the net benefits in FMCC overtime as the strategy emerges. Marion Harris : Hey, John, it's Marion. I think you've covered a lot of it. We do see used vehicle prices being stronger throughout this supply shock. And so they're going to remain strong for quite some time, just as John said earlier. And I think that's going to provide a lot of support for new vehicle pricing as well. The 100 billion you mentioned is about size of the US balance sheet. The Ford Credit in total bear in that 130 billion this year. So we're down quite a bit. But it's all dealer for plan and so that's affecting - that's a downside to our profitability, but on the other side of it is the strong used car prices. John Murphy : Okay, but could that be somewhat structural going forward? Or you really think this as transitory through the course of this year? Marion Harris : At this stage, I'd say it's transitory. John Murphy : Okay, all right. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to step back. If we look at the semi-issue, do you think you're more impacted than the industry? We're just trying to understand if you lose 1.1 million, do you think you're able to recoup those in 2022? Or other competitors maybe kind of sweep in and take some of them because they have maybe a better supply chain? Just trying to understand, maybe you could kind of recoup that loss volume into next year? Jim Farley : Great question. Thank you, Colin. I would say it's difficult to make that judgment. If you look into change of inventory, which is I think, a great predictor of wholesale back in the quarter competitively. I think most of the major brands were impacted almost equally. So a lot of different news releases, a lot of different opaque data coming out. I can understand why you asked a question. We don't know yet, how this will play out competitively. But we do know, the first quarter actually played out a lot more evenly than maybe even we thought. As it goes on in the second half and into 2022, we're starting to grow in confidence that we can support our recovery volume, we think it's prudent to have the 10% in our planning, but we are going to work very hard to make sure that doesn't happen. It's just too early to tell. The Renesas impact we think is going to be largely finished by the second quarter, if they execute, and they're just in the middle of that right now. And so that kind of leads us back with the time when these foundries and how persistent that's going to be. And right now, I just think it's a little too early to declare what that's going to look like. But what we do know is the first quarter kind of turned out that most major players except for some of the companies who had buffer stock and saw this coming. They weren't affected. But I think Renesas now swept up almost everyone in the industry, just hard to tell how lumpy that's going to be across different brands. Colin Langan : No, thank you. That's a very helpful color. Just more strategically, you made the announcement on Ion Park yesterday. I mean, how should we be viewing this? I mean, is this an effort to make your own batteries? Or is this trying to build that expertise in house so you could provide that to your battery partners? I'm not sure if we should read more than to that announcement. Jim Farley : Thank you so much for asking this question. The answer is this is a very important announcement from Ford strategically. In the first inning we could buy off the shelf and cherry pick the technology and energy density and the cost. We've totally entered a different zone now, with our volumes - planned volumes going up so much. So we've already made the decision of vertically integrating the company. We're now building motors e-axles now. We've been writing our own battery management software for quite some time. And now it's time for us to lock in on the latest technology and to have a secure cell production relationship. There's no news to make today. But the reason why that Ion Park announcement is so important is because it's our place where we will learn. We will learn about with our partners how to transition to the very best in technology, energy density, the minerals, all the supply chain for batteries and cells, but also the manufacturability. And ultimately, I think to be competitive in this industry, a major brand like Ford will have to vertically integrate all the way through the system. It's just too early to make a bunch of announcements. But this is our dream team, who will be developing that capability in the company. Colin Langan : Okay, thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC capital markets. Joseph Spak : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Actually I wanted to go back to something Rod brought up earlier. I know you mentioned 700,000 units out in the second quarter. Of course, we don't know what you were originally planning. So is it likely the second quarter looks similar to the second quarter of last year? And somewhat related to your point John, like the $2.5 billion headwind for the year is really just the high end of your prior range, but is the gross number higher? And that's been offset by other factors such as stronger pricing and maybe Ford Credit that bring it back down to that high end? Jim Farley : Yes, that's - thanks, great question. So it is similar to what we saw last year. We're going to lose about 700,000 units, which said was 50%, roughly 50% of the planned production we had. Maybe you look at second quarter of last year and it was very similar to that. And I would say, as we got into this - through the quarter, we have seen the team identify opportunities to offset more of the impact than we had originally thought. That's why we're able to contain a much higher miss on the volumes within that original guidance and so the teams have been working extremely hard to bring the goodness that we're seeing in the core run rate of the business through and then to find other opportunities, so absolutely, in both of those. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then second question - glad to hear the discussion about trying to keep dealer inventories more balanced. I guess the other lesson that could be learned here, and I'm curious Jim, [indiscernible] whether you have any preliminary thoughts is, do you just need to - we've gone through a couple of these crisis, do you need to change how you think about assuring supply of key components including chips, and or that sort of keeping more inventory historically, maybe it's more direct buy and not relying on Tier 1s? And if so, maybe again, at a high level, how should we think about that practically working? Like, where in the value chain will that inventory be stored? And is that maybe a cost you're willing to incur for greater stability in the future? Jim Farley : Thank you. The answer is, yes. We have learned a lot through this crisis that can be applied to many critical components. That will be the essence of our new business, our modernized Ford, and it goes far beyond semi chips, there are other components that are really key enablers. It was very interesting for me, personally as the CEO, to talk to many of our colleagues in other industries and to find out how common buffer stocks are and how common direct buys are for the width of boundaries. Even if the company still buys the components with the chips on them from a supplier, they still negotiated a direct deal. These are all on the table of Ford right now, as you can imagine, yet we're also thinking about what this means for the world of batteries, and silicon and all sorts of other components that are really mission critical for our company and our capability. When I look at the company and what we need to vertically integrate, these are the areas. These are the areas we're going to bet on moving inside the company for core competency. And as we do that the supply chain becomes even more critical, but we also know more about it. So thank you for the question and you can imagine everything is on the table like you mentioned, from buffer stocks to direct deals with the foundries. Joseph Spak : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Obviously, a standout performance in North America despite downtime and costs associated with the F-150 launch and the semiconductor shortage and a lot of moving pieces with regard to the guide and the rest of the year with the changes impacting the chip issue and now the Renesas fire, et cetera. So I thought maybe it would be great to just sort of zero in on your performance in the first quarter itself and get your thoughts on what a 12.3% North American margin in 1Q might imply for margin potential in a normalized environment. Kind of looking at the historical cadence of North America margin over the past five years or the five years ended in 2019. It seems like 1Q margin averages just about 40 BPS higher than the full year amount. And so maybe you're already operating in 1Q at almost a 12% kind of annual run rate. And that's amidst an F-150 launch and before any contributions from the Bronco. So how would you rate the underlying performance in North America? And does that performance in 1Q suggest once all the supply chain dust settles a stronger than targeted 10% regional margin? John Lawler : Thanks, Ryan. So I think we have to go back and just ground ourselves again, in that run rate of the business of 8 billion to 9 billion. And I don't want to get too far out ahead of ourselves on North America and what this quarter might mean for the run rate going forward. Given as you said, there's just a lot of moving parts within this quarter. I think the team's done a great job of managing through it. We really saw the 8 billion to 9 billion as the run rate heading into '22. We're going to do everything we can to continue to drive margin improvement, both here and overseas. And the team is focused and Jim's pushing us really hard to continue to modernize and improve the business in every place that we can. But as far as trying to predict coming out of this quarter what that means for the margin in North America in putting a number on the table. I'm not going to do that right now. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, thanks. Jim Farley : And Ryan just - it's Jim. Quickly, I'll be really quick. I've been in this business worked for different brands, I can't remember a time in my life, in my career, to have had so many hot products in one market like North America as Ford does right now. I mean, Mach-E sold out, Bronco Sport sold out, F Series sold out, Super Duty sold out, we have a very - our fresh new lineup is not only fresh, but it seems to be hitting the mark of the side case of the customer right now. And I don't know where that's going to take us. Yes, a really good question. I don't know where that's going to take us. But I do know it feels like we're going to be chasing demand for quite some time. Ryan Brinkman : That's helpful color. Let me ask just lastly, around the commodity inflation you're seeing and your ability to price for it. You've called out to 2.5 billion headwind for the year, you did take 3 billion of price in 1Q, although I'm cognizant, there's a lot that goes into that calculation including relative to new launches, et cetera. I think pricing is historically positive on launch models. Thankfully, as you mentioned, you have a lot of those this year, but it tends to be negative for carryover models, and I'm just thinking back to like, 2011, 2012 kind of coming out of the financial crisis in '08, '09 after a lot of final assembly capacity have been taken out every call you and others reporting on the relative anomaly of positive pricing on even no carryover model. So I'm just curious if we could see something similar now, say if the commodities headwind were to grow worse if the supply demand dynamic puts the industry in a position to pass really all the incremental costs on to the consumer or how do you see maybe the share of the burden taking place maybe the higher commodity is being - the cost of it being shared between yourselves versus the consumer versus suppliers, dealer margin. I don't know what you think. Jim Farley : Yes, I would say, we're definitely feeling the commodity headwind, as John said and inflation, it feels like we're seeing inflation in variety parts of our industry kind of in ways we haven't seen for many years. On the other hand, it feels like it's all due to a lot of one timers as the economy comes out of lockdown. So I think it's a bit too early to declare the run rate, where it's going to be, it's just too hard to tell from my standpoint. I will note though, based on your question that many of the vehicles that are supposedly ageing at Ford or normally would be ageing are still relatively new. Super Duty is relatively new, Explorer is relatively new. Yes, Escape - we have all the Lincoln lineup is brand new. So normally we wouldn't have so much new at the same time. And even the vehicles that are one or two years old are still relatively new in their segments. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our last question for the day will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : So I'm still trying to better understand the $8 billion to $9 billion run rate, which is unchanged from your view earlier in the year. So let me try and ask it this way, did the first quarter earnings results play out as you had expected at the beginning of the year? And if it played out better, what are some of the expected offsets which are non-semi related that would prompt you to keep the same basis as the underlying profitability? John Lawler : No, the quarter did not play out as we originally expected, right. It came in much better, we did not expect that we would be able to more than offset all of the impact of the chips in the quarter, which was 17%, or about 200,000 units. So we saw incredible opportunity there from the industry wide supply and demand imbalance. So we saw pricing increase significantly. We also then, because of the supply imbalance, we really pushed hard on mix. So those were things that allowed us to improve the quarter. We did not expect to use vehicle prices to increase 14% in the quarter. And they did and that helped. And that was part of what's happened with Ford Credit and the performance of Ford Credit. And then as we go through the year Emmanuel, one of the things that did not hit us in the first quarter that's going to hit us through the rest of the year is the commodity cost increases that come in quite significantly through Q2 to Q4. So those are some of the things that are coming back and are going to come through in the second half of the year. And then the other thing is as production normalizes a bit and supply and demand comes worn balance, we do expect that we should see some of this pricing that we saw in the first quarter moderate a bit. And we should see some of that happen through the second quarter - through the second half of the year. Emmanuel Rosner : Is the commodities impact larger, much larger than you had though originally? John Lawler : When we had first looked at it, we thought it was going to be significant, somewhere between 1.5 billion to 2 billion. So it's slightly higher than where we had thought coming into the year. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay, and then follow up question. I find very impressive some of the improvement that you're showing in the first quarter in terms of net pricing and cost in some of the international markets and showing some good traction with the fitness initiative. I was hoping you could comment directly on Europe in particular around - and South America around the sustainability of some of these performance that we're seeing? How much you think is sort of market driven versus some of your own actions, both on the net pricing side, and also obviously on the cost side, the sustainability of those. John Lawler : Yes, so in Europe this is the second strong quarter that Ford of Europe is printed for us. And I think what you're seeing there is the redesign flowing through and showing up significantly again in this quarter. And of course, the market was aided a bit by what we're seeing the dynamics in this quarter, but the fundamental underlying strength of the business in Europe has improved. We took over a billion dollars of structural costs out as we relooked at the footprint. We've moved into commercial vehicles and improved our share there. We have a higher mix of utilities. All of that is providing a much stronger business for us in Europe. And you've seen that two quarters in a row now. Then when we look at South America, we reduced our volumes significantly and we improved our profitability. And that just comes back to the point that we brought to the market and we are and now we're going to focus on our higher margin vehicle or smaller footprint or smaller business down there leaning into Ranger in Transit, which are good vehicles in the market. And they're strong vehicles for us as a company and so you're starting to see that redesign really take hold. Emmanuel Rosner : Good to hear. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And with that, we must conclude today's Ford Motor Company first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. We do appreciate your participation and ask that you please disconnect.",

Jim Farley : Thank you, Lynn. Hello, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. Early in the second quarter, 2 months ago, we detailed our strategy for the future Ford. Put simply, our Ford Plus plan is focused on 2 things, really distinctive products that only Ford could do and an always-on relationship and experience for our customers that gets better and better over time. We're building on our foundational strengths, our iconic products, the uniquely appealing vehicles, our manufacturing excellence, and the industry's best captive finance company. But we're now adding new capabilities and new talents, and we're investing in new businesses that will accelerate our value we create for customers and our investors. We're committed to delivering a richer experience for our Ford and Lincoln customers, one that improves over time with things like our over-the-air software upgrades, data-driven experiences, productivity and uptime services for our critical commercial customers, charging software, and a lot more. Ford Plus also means introducing the industry's most compelling, high-volume, electric vehicle line-up and investing the capital and human resources required to design and build world-class batteries and electric powertrain components. And with Argo AI, we're well-positioned to launch an autonomous people and goods delivery business with significant future growth potential. But fundamental to transforming forward is to further strengthen our auto operations while we're also expanding our addressable market. Our commitment is to earn your confidence with strong execution quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year, delivering solid returns regardless of the challenges that we face with external environment like we did in the second quarter. Despite the many headwinds from the semiconductor shortage, some of which were unique to Ford, our teams skillfully managed our business and we generated a positive EBIT. And I can tell you that this outcome was far from certain at the beginning of the quarter. It required intense focus from our team, on cost, pricing and mix. The primary advantage we have right now is the strength of our product portfolio. And it's about to get a lot stronger. We stopped making me too products in declining segments few years ago. And we unleashed our product development team to create emotional and distinctive products that only can come from Ford. The Mustang Mach-E, which is already the second best-selling electric SUV in the U.S., was recently named Car and Driver Electric Vehicle of the Year after rigorous testing against 10 other great EVs, including the Tesla Model Y Performance, the Porsche Taycan, and the Audi e-tron. The demand for our first round of high-volume EVs clearly has exceeded our most optimistic projections. The reservations for the F-150 Lightning have now climbed well past a 120,000 units. And 75% of those customers are new to Ford. We're now working around the clock to break constraints and increase our manufacturing capacity for these red hot new battery electric vehicles. We're working with LG Chem, SKI Innovation to increase our annual battery capacity for the Mustang Mach-E by 70%. And we're taking similar actions ahead of the launches of E-Transit later this year and the F-150 Lightning early next year. The customer and critical reception to our new Bronco lineup has also been remarkable. In June, we started shipments to fulfill 125,000 orders we have for Bronco II and four-door models. And 70% of those Bronco customers are also new to Ford. And then there's the Maverick, our upcoming hybrid pickup, that offers room for five, gets 40 miles per gallon in the city and is priced starting at less than $20,000, and customer already recognize the value of this product and the initial interest to our dealers is more than almost 80,000 orders. Great products alone are not sufficient, though, to deliver Ford Plus. Always on means, we are regularly interacting with our customers on things large and small, and we're building new capabilities, like connected services, to enrich the customer experience and drive reoccurring revenue streams. We developed a proprietary software and hardware stack we called Blue Oval Intelligence to deliver updates to customers' vehicles over the year. Some of our competitors can do it for their entertainment systems, we do it for almost all of our modules in the vehicle. For example, the Mustang Mach-E activation rates, the number of customers who opt in to Connected services like FordPass, are now over 95%. We have now updated more than 150,000 vehicles over-the-air just this year. And we expect this to top 600,000 vehicles by year-end. And by 2028, we will have 33 million OTA capability vehicles on the road around the world. And we are mining the real-world data from these vehicles real-time to better meet our customer needs. To me, this is the most important point. For example, driven by the vehicle data from the Mustang Mach-E and the F-150 already, we've identified $50 million in efficiencies just from warranty cost avoidance and other opportunities. We're also building out our global Ford Pro commercial business, which we expect to grow from 45 billion in 2025, from 27 billion in 2019. Last month, we announced our acquisition of Electriphi to help accelerate electric vehicle fleet adoption. By offering those customers the best-scaled depot charging experience for all commercial customers. It's an example of how we're building out Ford Pro now. In mobility, we are now focused on planning and executing a phased deployment of AVs that will lead to large scale commercialization of Ford's AVs. Last week, as you've seen, we reached the industry first collaboration between Argo and Lyft, to deploy Ford Driverless Vehicles on the Lyft TNC network. This collaboration will enable commercial deployment at scale and demonstrate Ford and Argo 's ability to connect into multiple TNCs or transportation networks. And on the technology front, Argo, I'm really excited about this, introduced Argo Lidar, which will help us expand our autonomous services beyond the dense urban areas that most are focused on. This new lidar designed to be cost effective and manufacturing at scale will offer what we believe is the industry's longest distance sensing range of 400 meters with dark object detection for safe highway driving. Now, before John reports on the quarter, and our expectations for the rest of the year, let me give you an update on the semiconductor situation. In April, we said we'd expect to lose about 50% of our planned volume in the second quarter, which then implied a loss in adjusted EBIT . In fact, we did better than expected. We leveraged the strong demand to optimize our revenue and profits. We're seeing signs of improvement in the flow of chips now in the third quarter, but the situation remains fluid, especially due to the delay in ramp up of one of our key suppliers, Renesas, that Ford is uniquely exposed to in the first half. Overall, after effectively managing through the first half, we are now spring-loaded for growth in the second half and beyond because of those red-hot products, pent-up demand, and improving chip supply. Navigating these chip constraints has led us to make important permanent changes in our business model at Ford. We are modernizing our go-to-market strategy. What does that mean? We're placing greater emphasis on build-to-order sales bank, not just low stocks. We have learned that, yes, operating with fewer vehicles on lots is not only possible, but it's better for customers, dealers, and Ford. But we're also driving a significant increase in the number of customers configuring and ordering their vehicles online. So we have better visibility to real demand using an order bank. This allows us to lower inventories, simplify our incentives, and reduce our order complexity in the industrial systems cost. For our customers, upside is that they more quickly get the precise vehicle they want. Now, this isn't theoretical. I hope we get into the Q&A. We're doing it right now as we speak. Relative to the supply chain, we made 3 notable changes. First, we are no longer relying heavily on a tier-procurement structure for transparency. We are now engaging directly, for example, with the fabs on semiconductors and key points in supply chain for critical components, electronic components. With closer relationships and more transparent exchange of information, such as technology roadmaps, we can integrate their know-how into our designs to better align supply and demand. Second, we're providing longer-term forecast to critical vendors so they can better understand and accommodate our requirements. And third, we are more comprehensively scanning for obstacles in our supply chain. Risk mitigation actions include stockpiling of critical parts like semis, dual sourcing and design interchangeability in the case of single sources. These changes are all being applied to new technologies as well, including batteries, which are rapidly becoming a larger portion of our bill of material at Ford. Our pending joint venture with SK Innovation, called BlueOvalSK, will produce EV battery cells and arrays, helping us secure supplies of batteries at competitive cost and performance levels really critical given our demand for our new electric vehicles. And now I'd like to turn over to John to take us through the results for the quarter and our outlook. John Lawler : Thank you, Jim. So first I want to reiterate that everything we do and every decision we're making, including capital allocation, it's squarely focused on delivering our Ford Plus plan. And you'll see that as I share our key takeaways from the quarter, our full-year outlook, and describe how we're positioned for even stronger performance heading into 2022. And as Jim said, we delivered better-than-expected results, given the semiconductor constraints. Year-over-year, our automotive business improved across several key financial metrics as we overlap the industry-wide COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns we saw in the second quarter of last year. Now, for a more accurate picture of our true trajectory in this present environment, we're focusing more on sequential comparison, and we think those are more appropriate. While wholesales were down 28% sequentially, our teams optimized from revenue and profit with disciplined incentive spending and mix management. We allocated chips to customer orders, new launches, and our more profitable vehicles. In addition, the strength of our sales order bank gives us confidence in our ability to drive a more balanced performance of wholesales, revenue, and profit in the second half of this year, including sequential improvement in wholesales and share. So let's turn to our results. On a consolidated basis, wholesales and revenue were up 18% and 38% year-over-year respectively, and we delivered adjusted EBIT of 1.1 billion with adjusted margin of 4%. Outside of North America, our underlying trajectory continues to improve despite the impact of the semiconductors and that's driven by more focused product portfolios, geographic footprint, as well as, lower costs. And Ford Credit continued to deliver strong performance with record quarterly EBT of 1.6 billion. And that's demonstrating why it's a strategic asset and critical to enabling Ford Plus. And a prime example is through the launch of a new service like Ford Pro FinSimple, which provides bundled financing for commercial vehicles, services and EV charging. And so it's another example of Ford Credit being a strategic weapon for us.  Now, turning to the regions. North America posted a 40% sequential decline in wholesale due to the semiconductor shortage. Now, as we managed the chip constraints, we focused our efforts on customer or customers ordering vehicles for future delivery. We exited the second quarter with our U.S. customer sold order bank up more than seven times compared to a year ago. And with new models to come, we are clearly poised for a rebound in North America when the semiconductor supply stabilizes and aligns with demand. On a year-over-year basis, EBIT was up 1.1 billion. Outside of North America, the turnaround of our operations remains on track. In aggregate, EBIT improved 800 million year-over-year, but declined sequentially, mainly driven by Europe, where the semiconductor shortage caused wholesale units to drop sequentially by nearly 35%. The transformation in Europe continues as the region capitalizes on strength in commercial vehicles with Ford Pro, and a more focused passenger portfolio, including key imports. Europe has stepped up investments in electrification, including 1 billion for a new EV manufacturing center in Cologne, the launch of our E-Transit next spring, and a new all-electric light commercial vehicle from Romania. In South America, our restructuring is on track. Our lean de-risked and asset-light business model is focused on our strengths with ranger, transit and key imported vehicles. The region introduced Bronco Sport and Mustang Mach-1 I in selected markets, and is preparing now for the launch of the new transit van in the second half of this year. In China, we continue to see improvement in key areas of focus, including Lincoln, commercial vehicles, electric vehicles, and with our portfolio of near premium Ford vehicles. Lincoln attained its highest ever quarterly sales, was profitable, and also captured the number 1 spot in J.D. Power's luxury sales satisfaction ranking. unseating Audi, which had held the position for 11 years. In addition, 97% of Lincoln's volume is now produced locally, and commercial vehicles now account for 52% of overall sales mix in China. And finally, we are readying for the launch of the localized Mustang Mach-E later this year. Our international markets group, we delivered another solid quarter, leveraging its portfolio strengths with Ranger pickups and Everest SUV. And we're continuing to assess our business in India and we'll have more to say on this later this year. Company-wide second quarter adjusted free cash flow was negative 5.1 billion. As expected, semiconductor-related volume losses had a greater impact on the free cash flow than EBIT because of adverse working capital and timing differences related to customer allowances from marketing incentives. Ford Credit did provide a partial offset with distributions of 4 billion in the quarter. Now, we expect working capital and these timing differences to normalize over time as the semiconductor supply is restored. Cash and liquidity remained very strong, ending the quarter at 25.1 billion and 41 billion respectively. The strength of our balance sheet provides significant financial flexibility to navigate periods of stress, while also continuing to invest in growth in our Ford Plus plan. So now let's turn to the outlook. Based on the underlying strength of our business and present assessment of the semiconductor supplies through the second half, along with other factors, we have increased our outlook for full-year adjusted EBIT to between $9 billion to $10 billion. Now this assumes about a 30% sequential increase in volume in our second half versus our first half, which is supported by the anticipated improvement in the supply of semiconductors. Our guidance implies we expect second-half adjusted EBIT to be lower than the first half of the year. And so we provided a bridge to help with this. And we've included that on page 19 of our earnings presentation. So let me provide a little bit of color around this. Relative to tailwinds, we expect about 3 to 4 billion in favorable market factors and that of an increase in volume-related production costs for the higher volumes. Headwinds, right? We see headwinds coming through and we see pressure on contribution margin. We expect commodities to be up almost $2 billion, half-over-half. Warranty costs are expected to be higher in the second half up about 500 million that we still expect full-year warranty expense to be down year-over-year. Relative to structural costs, about 1.5 billion in investments in modernization, consistent with what we laid out in May, including customer experiences, connectivity, IT, new product launches. Looking at Ford Credit. Based on current market dynamics, we expect Ford Credit to decline by about 1 billion as auction values begin to normalize and we also have a non-repeat of reserve releases that we had in the first half. And lastly, we also have the non-recurrence of the 900 million non-cash gain [Indiscernible] we booked in the first quarter. And it's important to note that this gain also impacts our run rate heading into 2022. We are also increasing our full-year adjusted free cash flow target to 4 to 5 billion, supported by expected favorable working capital in the second half as production increases from an anticipated improvement and chip availability. Now, as our operating results improve, so those are cash conversion, which we continue to target in the range of 50% to 60%, and the strengthened cash conversion in our balance sheet provides us ample financial flexibility to invest in growth, including in EVs; Ford Pro, our connected services and mobility. And looking towards 2022, we are confident in the underlying trajectory of our business and excited to see the momentum continue as we leveraged one of the strongest product lineups in our history and continue to implement our Ford Plus plan. We're on a new path at Ford. We got a plan, the resources, and the result to build a better business. So now, I'll hand it over to the operator to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson, Barclays. Brian Johnson : I got a couple of questions. First, a little bit of housekeeping. but just thinking ahead to '22. If we take the second half exit rate of 3.5 billion, but also bear in mind that your first half is typically the stronger half of the year for Ford, is there any read through for 2022? John Lawler : Hi, Brian. Thanks. Yeah. I think the way we see it is that we've got strength in the underlying performance of our business. As we head into 2022, we also know that the product lineup is going to get stronger, right? We're just launching Bronco now. We've got F-150 Lightning next year. We have Maverick next year. And we also expect that we should get to more of a full line rate on our manufacturing of all our other vehicles in new vehicles that we've had this year. So we do see strength in the product line heading into next year. But what we also see heading into next year are a few headwinds. Ford Credit, we expect that to be more normalized to our run rate that we normally see, and that's because we see auction values coming down. And then we shouldn't -- we should see our credit reserves and our credit losses normalize as well. We also see that next year as volumes increase and stocks increase across the industry, we should see some pricing moderation. Again, we also see commodities being higher next year as well. And we're going to continue to invest in our new product portfolios. We've got the launches coming in next year. We've got our Ford Plus plan. So we see that continuing as we head into next year as well. So, there are some headwinds, but the underlying strength of the business continues to be positive. And with that, we see that trajectory continuing into 22 and then on our way to the 8% EBIT margin for 23. Brian Johnson : Okay. And just a follow up, 1.5 billion 2H headwind from investments in modernization, is that something new that was planned for this year, but maybe back-end loaded due to management focusing on the chip shortage or how do you think about that? John Lawler : Well, that was planned, that's coming in. Part of that's due to the launches of the vehicle; with the launch costs comes advertising. But we're also investing in connectivity, the IT we need to put in place for the connectivity, as well as, customer experiences, digital experiences, user experiences with the vehicle. So we're continuing to invest to build out our Ford Plus plan. Jim Farley : And we're not slowing down our modernization because of the chip situation; in fact, we're doing the opposite. Brian Johnson : Okay. And a question for Jim. As you look at the order book for the F-150 Lightning and what's shaping up for the Bronco and the Maverick, any sense of how many of those customers are, as you mentioned, [in the F-15] (ph) new to Ford, but also maybe new to that segment. So for example, SUV buyers migrating to the E Lightning due to the storage or the bi-directional charging or other features? Jim Farley : Great question. Put simply, what we've learned about our very large order bank for Lightning is way over indexed on the coast. Almost 80% are new to Ford, what\u2019s interesting 2 out of 5 are people who are going to trade in an ICE pickup which is very important because it indicates a move little bit faster to full-size truck BEV than maybe are our optimistic assumptions. And so I would say what we've learned so far is that the customers are largely new to Ford, but they aren't new to the segment. These are customers who really like these silhouetted vehicles. What is really interesting for me is some would portray the full-size truck industry as kind of a conservative customer. It's not what we're seeing, is these very large order bank for F-150 Lightning, they're new to BEV, and they are excited to move to BEV. And they are -- more than half of them are pickup truck customers. Brian Johnson : Okay. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Hi everybody. I just first wanted to clarify the answer that you gave to Brian's question. So you're going to be annualizing at 6 billion to 8 billion in the back half, and I think what a lot of people want to understand is, is that kind of a fair bridging-off point for us to think about what happens from here into 2022 and beyond. So did you assume some moderation of pricing already in that number? Is that level of investment kind of the run rate? And how should we think about the incremental benefit from that run rate for Bronco, Maverick, for the warranty improvement and some of the international improvements that you're working on? John Lawler : Hi, Rod. Thanks. So in the second half, we show the net number there for the volume net of the manufacturing production costs and other market factors. So what we are assuming is that in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, we start to see some moderation in pricing due to the fact that we should see volumes in inventories and stocks coming up a bit. So that is something that we do have built into that number for the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. And then when it comes to 2022, Bronco is just getting up now -- up and running now, launched now. As Jim said, we have a hefty order bank there. And then F150 Lightning Maverick, they're launching next year. So our product portfolio is strong today, it's going to be even stronger next year. And so we see that contributing to the run rate as well. So I think coming out of Capital Markets Day, we talked about the trajectory of the business. 2022 being definitely stronger than '21 as we walk towards 2023 and the 8% EBIT margin that we plan to hit. Rod Lache : And just secondly, really interesting comment about that sevenfold increase in your order bank and changing the way the vehicles are sold, can you just talk a little bit about what that actually means from a volume perspective? Because I don't think we've ever really known what your actual customer order bank actually what was the magnitude of that? Maybe you could just tell us what that number was a year ago and any thoughts on what this actually means for pricing? Obviously, it's positive, but those units are not going to land on dealer lots for very long. So it would seem that it's really not a big reason to significantly boost incentives anytime soon if they're leaving lots very quickly. Jim Farley : Thank you, Rod. Put simply, we're really committed to both going to an order based system and keeping our inventories between 50 and 60 days' supply. I've been here at Ford for 13 years. There were many years after the financial crisis where our day supply was 20, 30, 40 days. And in those years, the maximum retail order bank we had in the U.S. was 1000 to 2000 a month. We're now at 70,000 units on our way to 80,000 units. That gives you the order of magnitude difference in the way we are looking at this order bank change for the company. Lot of people in our industry are making big deal about the move online? Sure. But for Ford, we think there's massive benefit across all stakeholders for going to an order bank system. It put pressure on our industrial system to deliver quickly. It reduces our dealers costs more than just low day supplies, you mentioned. It allows us to significantly reduce our incentives. And I \u2013guarantee you, I don't know how much money we're wasting. I know we're wasting money on incentives, I just don't know where. With an order based system, we will have much less risk of that. It requires us to dramatically reduce our order complexity as well. So there are a lot of enablers that have been put in place to move us to this new system and new go-to-market approach. I'd love to talk to you more about it, but I'll try to give you the high hard ones. Rod Lache : Thanks. Makes sense. Thanks, everybody. Operator : Our next question comes from John Murphy, Bank of America. John Murphy : I just wanted to actually follow up quickly on that. Jim, you mentioned getting back to 50 days to 60 days supply. That sounds closer to normal than not, but you're also -- the way you're describing the order bank, it looks -- sounds like 20%, 25% of your sales would be built-to-order, the horseshoes and hand grenades. So I'm just curious how you decide where that balance lands? how you keep the inventory tight, your partners to dealership, happy, and selling and creating value for you. But then also big part of the story is the tightness in the secondary market, and the used market, keeping [resids] (ph) high, which is helping the new vehicle pricing and it certainly helping out at Ford Motor Credit. So there's a seesaw effect you get the benefit on both sides. Just how do you figure out where this should land and how you actually execute on it. Jim Farley : Really good question. So the team has done a lot of work on this. I will try to answer it very simply. Our target is 50 days to 60 days supply. That means trucks will be a little bit higher. We have a lot -- about a third of our truck dealers [in C&D] (ph) county, 5 trucks to them could be a 100-day supply, but they need 5 trucks for the local community. And for urban and suburban dealers, it will be less than that range. Different segments will have different targets. We actually did this post-financial crisis for a few years. And then over time, [lost] (ph) discipline. And this is quite important for this management team. We have a weekly and monthly operations review, where we'll look at this very carefully by segment for each of the regions. That's the kind of soft wiring or management judgment. Going to an order bank, I would say is a hardwired way of reducing the stock. And I think it's going to take both for Ford to make this transition. It can't be just relying on management. keeping within that range. We certainly will have an exception process to go beyond that, and there will be a pretty tough discussion with our operating teams. But I think what I'm more excited about is the hardwiring of going to an order-to-delivery order system, which actually our new launches gave us that gift. Because for Bronco, and Mach-E, and some of the other high demand vehicles, we moved the reservation system into an order bank system. We then realized, my God, why don't we do this for all the vehicles, not just those vehicles. And that's when we had to put a series of incentives and more policy changes like order complexity reduction in the system to make it kind of the way we do things at Ford. I think it's going to require both changes. John Murphy : Okay. That's helpful. And just a follow-up on that, current state of affairs of retail versus fleet mix. It seems like can you talk to the dealers, is an emphasis on retail. The dealers, certainly at your level, just curious, if fleet comes back -- I mean, the demand is there, how are you balancing that \u2013 Jim Farley : Sure, it is. John Murphy : -- current days and go forward. I mean, because the demand is there, it's just some of it is getting fulfilled in the used market. They're going after auctions instead of ordering from you guys. So how do we think about that recovery go forward and where does it stand right now? Jim Farley : Really good question. So it depends on the region. Of course, we're a dominant commercial brand in multiple regions like Western Europe and the U.S., even in China in certain segments. And we're seeing in Europe a very dramatic order bank on our vans. It is -- it is something I've never seen in my career. We're talking months and months and months of back orders. So the demand for our commercial vehicles in Europe is extremely strong and the order bank is months and months. In the U.S. we're very fortunate that our commercial business is heavily focused on transit and Super Duty, and of course, F-150 is kind of mix. And so for those vehicle lines, transit and Super Duty, it's very easy to -- we don't have to prioritize between retail and commercial because those vehicle lines are almost a 100% commercial. The one that's challenging for us to balance is F-150. And we -- as you could see in this quarter, we're very carefully mix managing. But we are very respectful of the needs of our commercial customers. We know where our toast is buttered. And those customers are really important for us. In fact, we\u2019re in discussions with them right now about the trade-off between feature content and availability. We have many commercial customers in the U.S. that have been waiting for months and months for their vehicle. And we are discussing with them, would you be willing to take off feature content to get your vehicles now? And that's -- and you can expect us to be balanced about that discussion and negotiation and compromise. And it's -- we'll make the right call for the company and for the customer. But they are pushing us for availability now, even if it means lower feature content. John Murphy : That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Thanks. A great call so far. And Jim, I have to say, I did a Ctrl+F for the word hybrid in the [Indiscernible] and in the press release and I don't see it, man. No hybrid. It's a beautiful thing. So good. Yeah. But they're dead. They're gone. All right. My question on EVs, your BEVs. When do you think that they can be positive profit on a fully costed basis, not contribution. Like, when can they be profitable? And do you think it's 2022 is still too early for that? My first, and I have a follow-up. John Lawler : Thanks, Adam. Actually, Mach-E is profitable. Contribution margin, positive and profitable on the bottom line today. Adam Jonas : Wow. John Lawler : So we've seen strong demand for that. Yeah. So I think when we look at it over time, as we talked about [Indiscernible] , and we've talked about with you. We've got to ride that technology curve down. We've got to get to the $80 per kilowatt hour for the battery pack before the end of the decade. We've got to scale the BEV content. We have commonality, and the top hats, and other components that will help us as well. And then, of course, we need to build on our services and such to really improve the profitability of the [Indiscernible] as we move forward. But I can tell you that Mach-E is profitable today. Adam Jonas : Wow, that's incredible at 50,000 type run rate for that to be correct. Okay. My follow-on question, Jim, is about always on and the order bank. I mean, really huge. Just really interesting when you combine the order bank system with always on, where you go connect -- can engage the consumer directly for services and F&I and insurance and the OTA. But I am talking to some dealers that are freaking out. That some Darwinian forces could be at work where you're not, let's say, directly infringing on the franchise laws, but you're dancing close as you probably should given all the technological changes over the past 70 or 80 years since these laws came. So what's your message to them? What if order book goes to 80% of your units or the majority, and then the dealers are just these delivery centers? And then, you're going direct on all the other wonderful services. What's the message to the dealers? Jim Farley : Great question. Well, we're going to have a couple of different population of dealers. We are going to have our professional dealers and the answer is a little different for them versus our retail dealers. We'll have our rural dealers and the answer is a little bit different for them than suburban and urban dealers. The -- I would say the message we're giving to our team, our dealers is, look, we're going to have to work really carefully together, so -- because the customers are going to have a lot of questions on Ford BlueCruise, for example. So we want to make sure the dealers are very knowledgeable about these new OTA features, that are really meaningful in the use of the customer's life. That's one. The second one is service, service, service, service. Service. That is the most important thing for us, is wiring a closed loop between the vehicle, the condition of the vehicle, the service capacity of the dealers, and the customer is going to be the most important ballet we're going to have to play together with the dealers. This is especially true for Ford Pro. And in fact, today, we already have 160 remote trucks doing service for our commercial customers at their business. Warranty work, that's a good example of the evolution of the business model, where they're taking their Service Department from a fixed hub and going on the road with their service capacity. And those trucks have to be cooked into the vehicle data and the prognostics. Our parts legacy system to order parts and the dealers on dispatch system. That has to be a closed loop. So, all I would say to you is the orchestration and our benefit, our chance to win. Just like maybe targets, a chance to win versus online retailers is that in-person service, especially in professional customers. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : Great, thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a good quarter. Inventory levels. We've never seen them at these levels obviously before and obviously it's impacting your market share. Any sense of how much of that you think you could recoup and how much are you concerned may switch to other brands because people might only wait for so long? John Lawler : Yeah. Hi, Colin. It's John. So I think what we're seeing here from a market share drop is completely related to the fact that our stocks reduced so much. We have the chip issue. We lost the volumes that we lost in the second quarter. We expect that as we work to improve the run rate and through the third quarter, we're very focused on maintaining this high turn rate, filling the orders that we have. As Jim said, we're going to continue to work on retail orders. And continue to bring our customers along that way as well. So we think that we have a good chance to regain that share, especially with the strong lineup that we have. and so we see this as a temporary issue related to the chip issue and the volume and production we had in the quarter. Jim Farley : And we will not cede truck leadership to anyone. Colin Langan : Okay. [Indiscernible] touch on Connected Services. You rolled out Ford Liive in Europe on commercial vehicles. I -- I believe it's free right now. I mean, how is that rollout going? And when do you try to monetize that and get revenue out of these services? Jim Farley : Great question. So we do -- we just launched FORDLiive, as Jim mentioned, in the UK and Spain. We have 5 more EU countries covered by the end of the year to launch, so we're really excited about FORDLiive. What we've committed to so far is in the next couple of years by 2025, we expect our digital and charging revenue in Ford Pro to be about 1 billion dollars today. I wish we had more time to focus on this frankly. We have about just under 200,000 unique subscriptions for our telematics and data services. We grew at about 20,000 units in the quart -- 20,000 subscriptions in the quarter. And we feel like that digital telematics and [Indiscernible] data like fuel tank information plus adding the charging services like Electriphi for Depot charging for our customers, our high-growth area with the revenue to that level in the next couple years. The monetization of FORDLiive is really around our traditional parts business, which has very high margins and we have a very low share. So the opportunity for us upside is tremendous, post warranty. Even our commercial customers, we get very few of those customers. And so the real payoff for this closed loop is going to be much higher share post warranty of that very profitable business. Colin Langan : Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Thanks for taking my question. One thing that especially stood out in your results, I think, is on Slide 6, where it shows that units wholesaled in the quarter rose 18% year-over-year, but that revenue was up by more than twice as much by 38%. So just a few questions around pricing and overall revenue per unit. I can see from the [Indiscernible] on Slide 9 that Net pricing helped EBIT by 1.9 billion or kind of 10% of last year's revenue, which seems suggests about the idea that half of the growth in revenue over unit volume into Q was driven by price and the other half by makes. Is that roughly correct? And what do you think the outlook is for continuing to grow revenue in excess of the change in volume? John Lawler : Yeah. Thanks, Ryan. I think pricing is the majority of what was behind that growth. We had a very strong quarter relative to pricing as we saw, our inventory shrink. And we see the strength in the underlying demand of the products that we have. And so I think I would think about it more as pricing, a little bit of mix in there, but more of it is pricing. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, very helpful. And then just as a follow-up, we saw some estimates that your incentive spending in June in the U.S., it may have fallen like 50% year-over-year, leading the decline in industry-wide incentives. I'm curious how much of the decline in incentives do you think maybe driven by hot new products like the F-150, Bronco, Bronco Sport, Mach-E, et cetera, versus how much is the function of the low inventory environment or maybe just a general inflationary environment? And to that end, it might be helpful to know if carryover pricing, which I think usually declines year-over-year, if that might also be tracking stronger and what your outlook is for incentive spending going forward, maybe in light of some of the comments you made earlier on the call about inventories and order bank, etc.? John Lawler : that's a great question. I think we've been working [Indiscernible] this as you'd expect. It's a combination of all of the above, right? We have strong products. We see continued demand for those strong products, supply is well short of that, it's allowed us to continue to keep the pricing strong and improve the pricing in the second quarter versus what we had expected. And I think as long as you see this imbalance between supply and demand, we'll continue to have stronger pricing power. As we've seen through the first quarter and the second quarter. As we go through the year, when we start to see supply and demand normalize. we'll see some of this pricing come off a little bit in the fourth quarter and then we'll have to see how that runs through next year. But given the strength of our product lineup and the demand we see, we expect to have a relatively strong pricing power for the near foreseeable future. Ryan Brinkman : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to get back to the investments in, in modernization and maybe frame that in the context of the 2023 view you laid out at the Capital Markets Day. How does that investment trend through those years as you think about the margin targets you laid out and there's an assumption that by the time you got to '23 or maybe a little bit later, there's a return on that investment, such that it becomes a neutral or even positive to the margin. John Lawler : Yes, thanks. Of course. as we make our capital allocations and we make these investments, we expect that we're going to get a return on them. And that's all part of our walk up into 2023, the 8% margin. We're also continuing to work on cost reductions elsewhere. right? These are investments that we're making in our new products with the launches and connectivity and IT. We've got advertising in there for these launches, and then, of course, customer experiences as I talked about earlier. But we're also driving cost reductions elsewhere as we continue to improve the business towards that 8% margin in 2023. So we'll invest in certain areas. We will see costs go up in certain areas, but we should also see cost coming down another areas, particularly material costs, et cetera. Jim Farley : One particular area? of modernization that doesn't I don't think get enough attention in where we're investing as a Company. Certainly 30 billion in electrification, and the vertical integration of batteries and our, of course our investment on autonomy. I think you all know about where we're spending our money in the general categories. The 1 I really want to highlight is the very significant investment in our embedded electrical architecture upgrade. This is really a significant move by Ford to not just invest in electrification, but move those products to fully digital updatable in all modules and go to a fully modern zonal electric architecture. I'm not going to go through the details, but this is a very expensive transition, but it will enable a whole new capability for the always -on experience than even today's connected vehicles like Mustang Mach-E. And I want to highlight that because it often gets lost in the other categories of investment and monetization. Joseph Spak : Okay, so just to clarify, so the EV spend is included in that bucket you mentioned? Jim Farley : Yes. Yes. So when we talk about upgrading our electric vehicles, it's much more fundamental than just the investment, and the tooling, and the engineering of the electric vehicle and its components and propulsion. It also includes a completely new approach to an embedded software and hardware system. Joseph Spak : Okay, And just -- and going back to the order bank, which is clearly interesting, that's -- it seems like an easier task, quite frankly, when you have great product like you do with the Bronco, the Mach-E, and the Lightning, which are -- seem well-received and also limited. I guess what I'm wondering is how are you going to sort of balance that with inventory as you think about like you're an explorer and your 4 or 5 of its product lifecycle or like is the plan to still keep inventories of the older products or more mature products tight such that you can still get some into the order bank or are there other plans to keep the product fresh throughout the lifecycle. That can lead to \u2013 Jim Farley : Sure. We'll have ground stock for sure in dealers. And we obviously have to keep the vehicle fresh. More and more of that will be the digital freshness of the vehicle. But I would say if you look at our 60 plus thousand unit order bank in North America, a lot of -- not all of those are Bronco s and Mustang Mach-Es. We're doing this for our whole brands. Joseph Spak : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. Philippe Houchois : Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. I've got 2 questions. The first one, sorry, I'll go back on this order bank and inventory levels. To be honest, I'm a bit surprised you talking about 50 days to 60 days of inventory in the few Trump because that's done much lower than what we've had in the past. And I would've thought the order bank would actually enable to actually carry much [Indiscernible] inventory and we've seen that benefit to pricing. So I wonder if the 56 days is the first step, but do you think you can do better in the future? And along those lines and then maybe more on the Ford Credit side. But when I look at European car companies, they carry more finished products on their balance sheet, the core balance sheet. And then [Indiscernible] to be less on the Cinco balance sheet, through the dealer receivables, where you guys are proxying. It's the opposite in the U.S. And I'm just wondering if you look at a situation where you go to more order banking for your production. If you end up carrying more inventory on your Industrial balance sheet, which would increase your working capital requirement from an industrial standpoint, that was my first question. And the second one, if I can ask, briefly on China. It seems like you're stalling a bit in China, and because you've localized lot more of Lincoln, more profit able. You had big losses I [Indiscernible] before, and side before. And I'm just wondering, can you comment maybe on what is happening generally in China? Is there -- there seems to be concern about how the Chinese brands are making good progress by some of the EVs launched by your competitors are not quite getting the love from customers that was expected. And I'm just wondering if you see a more difficult environment in China for you in the balance of the year into next year. Thank you. John Lawler : Yes. I will take the working capital. Now, where we see the order bank helping us is we actually see it simplifying the industrial system because we'll know exactly what we're going to build. So we're actually working through that now and trying to use that to simplify and reduce things like working capitals. So I think if anything, it would have the opposite impact. It would increase working capital. We use it to drive down working capital. And then on the day supply. What we've seen in the past is around a 75-day supply. So 50 day, it's a 25-day reduction. so we do see that as substantial. And, of course, that'll be different across the different vehicle lines. So we do see that as a substantial pull back in the day supply. Jim Farley : And just remember, in Europe, just [Indiscernible] Ford of Europe, the cross-border issue in Europe is not so small. We have holding centers and lots of ways to manage the stock. We don't plan to implement that system in the U.S. It evolved over time and we have one country. So I think we're getting -- our intention is, as John said, is not to handle it that way. In China, the team has made tremendous progress from a $1.5 billion loss hovering around breakeven now was slightly below that. And we're in a very important time for Ford in China. Lincoln is now profitable, and we just localized those models. We only launched Lincoln in 2015. I was there. So it's a recent phenomenon. And we're just about to launch a whole plethora of brand new vehicles, like we're doing in North America today. So we're on the eve of the Mustang Mach-E launch localized, and then we have all these new vehicles, the Evos, I can go on a long list, and it will be just like what we're seeing in North America, full of freshness, and that will play out over the next couple of years. So China is very important for our profit plans. I think the team has done a tremendous job in stabilizing our sales situation and improving our cost, and now And now it's going to be a growth story in China. We're just commercializing and industrializing the vehicles as we speak. And Mustang Mach-E, it's the first major one. Thanks. Philippe Houchois : Thank you very much. Operator : And our final question for the day will come from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Hi. Good evening. Thank you for squeezing me in. First, wanted to just ask on the chip shortage and I fully recognize the situation is very fluid and your crystal ball was as good as anyone else's. But do you have a sense for how long it might take until you're no longer supply-constrained on production or something that's fully resolved, by your best guess by early next year or do you think that this -- there might be still some supply constraint lasting much longer and deeper into 2022. So just the baseline expectations around that. John Lawler : So Dan Yes, I mean, I think my guess is as good as anybody is on this. We do see that the chip issue running through this year, and we could see it bleeding into the first part of next year. But I think we won't really have a good feel for that, until later in this year. We know that, as we've had discussions with the [Indiscernible] suppliers, they're telling us they're reallocating capital, they're increasing supply for automotive et cetera. But I think this is one of those things where we need to see the release coming through before we can really feel comfortable that we're out of the woods here. Dan Levy : Great. I understand. And second question is just on ICE versus BEV. And clearly you're deemphasizing ICE, and presumably that means the investment is coming down. I assume that part of that 30 billion headline number you gave includes some reallocation from ICE to EV. But I think we also know right now that, and maybe this is just a function of the market, but ICE sales are extremely strong in the U.S.. It could remain the case for a while. So what should we expect on margin for ICE vehicles, especially as some of that investment comes down? Is it possible that the outgoing margin on some of the ICE vehicles actually increases and you could potentially run into a negative mix issue as we -- as you start to pivot from ice to the beds? Jim Farley : Yeah. It's a good question. Generally speaking, that certainly could happen. We don't know how the demand will shift. Obviously, our guess is 40% of [Indiscernible] , 240 gigawatt capacity by 2030. So we're busy making all that happen as you say, 40% is a lot -- is a lot higher than today and I think we have -- well, I know we have the right strategy for the Company. But so much of this transition is going to depend on government support, infrastructure buildout. And we need to be patient. And I think agility will become a very important skill for the Company. So far, the first inning would imply that Ford 's number 1 in sports car is Mustang, we're number one in vans with transit, we're number 1 in pickups with F-150. We're electrifying all 3 of those in the next 6 months. And so far, the demand is actually higher than we expected. So I don't know what's going to happen. We don't know what's going to happen. The support in China, but especially in Europe, has accelerated the BEV adoption in those regions. But as you say, we get into the next phase of expansion with a lot more product offering and all that capital pointed at BEV s, it's hard to say. And it's hard to handicap the government's policy at a government level. over time. I think the most important thing isn't how much money we're spending, because that's necessary -- that's enough. It is our agility and the kind of execution of our BEVs and our management of the profitability of those vehicles, and that's where we're putting our energy. The agility of our industrial system, our manufacturing, our focus on the profitability improvement and the vertical integration for key electric components, and making our vehicles different and more competitive than others. I know it's a very general answer, but I don't think we know enough to answer your question. Dan Levy : Understood. That's helpful, nevertheless. But thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And with that, this concludes the Ford Motor Company's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We'd like to thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Jim Farley : Thank you, Lynn. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Well, this month marks one year since we'd began executing our Ford Plus Plan. It creates growth, value, and it allows us to win in emerging area of electric and connected vehicles. We built a strong team that combines top leaders from Ford with world-class talent recruited from outside of our Company.  Specific talents, specific people that are largely outside of our industry. This leadership team is committed to this plan and we're accelerating our progress. Ford Plus is not a tagline. It's not advertising. It's a larger, more ambitious way to think about our business and how we bringing value to our customers.  We're creating iconic and distinctive products that only four can do. Increasingly, always on relationships with our customers and ever improving user experiences, all why creating value for our shareholders. We're fully invested in this future. And we're taking big swings. Key to the plan is harnessing the power of connectivity.  We're designing a new generation of fully networked vehicles not delegated to our supply chain, but done inside the Company to revolutionize the experience of owning and operating Ford vehicle. That's embedded technology to unleash unlimited innovation. We're scaling the number of vehicles capable of over-the-air updates will be moving from 1 million vehicles today to 33 million by 2028. That scale. At the same time, we're moving aggressively to lead the electric vehicle revolution, substantially expanding our battery production as we speak today in the U.S. Infact, we already announced plans that will give us enough battery production to meet our mid-decade goal of a 141 gigawatts, which is enough to build more than 1 million battery electric vehicles a year and I think we'll need more.  R7 billion investments in Blue Oval city in Tennessee in the BlueOvalSK park in Kentucky sets a new standard for scale sustainability, advanced manufacturing, and training the next-generation of technology leaders. At the same time, the billion dollars of investment in our electrified center in Cologne, Germany will allow us to go all electric soon. That center will be all electric by 2023.  We're making final preparations to launch the F-150 Lightning. That defining 0 mission version of an America's best-selling vehicle for the past 40 plus years. Our all electric Mustang Mach-E is a hit with customers, not just in the U.S., but around the world, bringing a stunning number of new customers to the Ford brand.  Over 90% of the Mach-E owners say they would recommend a Mach-E to other customers. Critical as a new-generation of battery electric customers make new brand choices. Our challenge now is to break production constraints and increase availability to meet this incredible demand both in North America and in Europe, and also in China, the biggest EV market in the world. where we are just starting production and Mach-E.  We believe the global demand just for Mustang Mach-E could approach about 200,000 vehicles a year. We've created new organization, Ford Pro to change and power the future of work with compelling commercial vehicles, distribution, and services. While growing revenues to Ford. In a few weeks, we will start production of the new E-Transit, an electric version in the world's best-selling commercial van.  And in the third quarter alone, FORDLiive, Europe 's new connected uptime center, which I wish you could all see for our commercial customers, helps customers in the UK secure additional up time, preventing about $8 million of lost revenue and associated costs for our valuable customers.  We're reinventing icons like Bronco and creating new ones like Maverick. In fact, the all-new Maverick, 42 miles per gallon I might add, is the first standard hybrid pickup in the U.S. It's also America 's most fuel-efficient hybrid pickup. This is the strongest, most compelling lineup I'd ever seen from any mass market brand in my career.  And we are creating a spring loaded future as we emerge from the cheap shortages and COVID constraints. And we continue to make important strides in the technology and go-to-market strategy for autonomous vehicles. In the Second Quarter, we told you about a new partnership with Argo AI and Lyft. And then the Third Quarter, we announced a new partnership with Argo AI and Walmart.  This is Walmart's first ever multi-city autonomous delivery service. And it will be anchored in cities where we already have operations. Not the easiest miles in one city, but multiple cities and hard miles. In addition to making real progress on autonomy vehicles, operating domains, SDS, we fully support Argo AI 's aspiration to access public capital. To build this future, and generate the margins and cash flow.  We need to fund Ford Plus; we had a turn around our automotive operations, and improve our competitiveness. Our results in the third quarter show we are making significant progress. In fact, Company-wide, we achieved an 8.4% EBIT margin, including 10.1% in North America. Those margins, I will remind you are in line with our targets for 2023. More importantly, our operations outside of North America are likely to post the best performance in 4 years. Please note the performance in South America, largely driven by our success of our global redesign. We've been able to achieve this while thoughtfully managing our supply chain for short-term sustainable improvements including semiconductors, and prioritizing high demand and high profit vehicles.  And before I turn it over to John, a few thoughts. I believe we have the right plan to drive growth and unlock unprecedented value. You are already seeing favorable change in the slope of our earnings and cash flow. There's more to come. Given the strength of our business this year, we are increasing our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to between 10.5 and 11.5 billion. As we plan in earnest for next year, we're excited and energized about the opportunity in front of us and clear that we have so much more work to do to deliver on fourth potential. The word I would leave you with is focus. That competitive environment has never been more interesting and tough. And we intend to live up to our promise to compete like a challenger focusing on our top priorities to unlock Ford Plus growth with customers at the very center of everything we do. Now I will turn it over to John, who'll take you through our results for the quarter, our outlook for the full year, our capital allocation priorities, and our expectations heading into next year. John? John Lawler : Thank you, Jim. Now in the face of continued industry-wide semiconductor constraints, we stayed focused on our plan, strengthening our portfolio, and investing in opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. We delivered a solid quarter with 3 billion in adjusted Company EBITDA, and a margin of 8.4%. Free cash flow of 7.7 billion was as we expected up sharply on a sequential basis, driven by the positive working capital effects, from higher wholesales in EBITDA. We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity at over 31 billion and 47 billion respectively. Now across our automotive business, our playbook remained consistent as we optimize production for customer orders, new launches, and our most profitable vehicles.  And as expected on a sequential basis, our wholesales improved dramatically its chip supply for Ford improved. We also remained disciplined with incentive spending and mix management, which on a year-over-year basis, more than offset chip-related declines in volume. Ford Credit delivered another solid quarter with 1.1 billion in EBT as auction values continue to remain strong, and credit losses continue at near record lows.  For the fourth Quarter, we're assuming a sequential increase in wholesale. We also expect continued healthy mix and net pricing and solid results from Ford Credit, although not as strong as the Third Quarter. Headwinds include inflationary impacts on commodities and freight, and we also expect plan sequential increases in our Ford Plus modernization investments, including customer experience and IT. So let me share with you some highlights from the quarter before I turn to guidance, capital allocation, in our preliminary view of 2022. With improved chips supply, North America wholesales increased sequentially by 67% as the team prioritized launches, customer orders, and high-margin units while reducing the number of vehicles built, but waiting for chips.  Demand remains strong for our exciting vehicles. The order bank we are building paid off in the third quarter, representing 28% of our retail sales in the third quarter, and reaching a high of 31% in September. And our overall customer orders increased over 50% from the Second Quarter to more than a 100,000 orders, excluding Bronco. With the 10.1% EBITDA margin in the quarter, North America is now at a 9% margin year-to-date, just 100 basis points shy of our 2023 target of 10%. South America, marked its eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year improvement in EBITDA, and the business run rate is now approaching break even.  The region also launched its new commercial vehicle organization with the introduction of the new transit, which is manufactured in Uruguay. This transit is the first light commercial van to market in Brazil that includes connectivity as a standard feature. In Europe, the underlying trajectory of our business continues to strengthen though the adverse impact from chips has masked this improvement. In the Third Quarter, the business lost about 50,000 units, which would have had a substantial favorable impact on EBITDA. Our leadership, as the number one commercial vehicle brand continued in the quarter along with an extremely robust quarter bank. In China, Lincoln continues to perform well, extending its success in the most profitable segment, luxury, with retail sales up 24% year-over-year.  In fact, Lincoln has doubled its share of the China luxury market over the past 18 months. Our newly created BEV organization to open its first 13 direct-to-consumer Ford -select city stores, with a total of 25 expected to open by year-end. In IMG, our leadership team in India made the difficult decision to end manufacturing; following accumulated operating losses of more than 2 billion over the past 10 years.  Going forward, we will focus on importing iconic vehicles, including EVs. And overall, IMG had a solid quarter, capitalizing on our strengths, including ranger. Now as Jim highlighted, the underlying strength of our business supports increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021 to between $10.5 and $11.5 billion. And that's despite a lower than anticipated improvement in cheap availability in the second half of the year. Consistent with our adjusted EBITDA guidance three this year, our updated guidance for 2021 includes the $900 million non-cash gain on our investment in Rivian in our First Quarter adjusted results. So let me spend a minute on Rivian. Now, in the event that Rivian completes its IPO, we will record any gain on our investment in any subsequent adjustments of special items.  Accordingly, we will recast the 900 million non-cash gain from adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter to a special [Indiscernible] As Rivian completes their IPO in the fourth quarter, we will make this change when we report our fourth quarter earnings on February 3, 2022. Our guidance for 2021 adjusted free cash flow is unchanged at 4 to 5 billion, reflecting the higher EBITDA, but less favorable improvement in working capital and timing differences. Now this is due to lower than anticipated volumes than previously assumed in the back half of the quarter, and that's as a result of chip constraints. We do expect free cash flow to increase with higher production, and the associated improvement in supplier payables and other timing differences. Now let me turn to capital allocation, which again is the foundation of our value creation framework.  Our capital allocation discipline is driving a strong core business and Balance Sheet that provides the flexibility to invest in new growth opportunities as we deliver our Ford Plus plan. Ultimately, and ensures we returned value to our shareholders, both in the form of a higher share price and dividends. Today, we announced the reinstatement of our dividend.  Our board has approved restarting of regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter of 2021. Importantly, the dividend reflects our confidence in the improving run rate of the business and our ability to fund all of our calls on capital, including the growing investment in electrification and the trajectory of our Ford Plus plan.  The dividend was also sized to ensure we maintain appropriate optionality to manage continued uncertainties in the external environment. To give you a better sense of our calls on capital between 2020 and 2025, we expect total capital expenditures of about 40-45 billion or run rate of roughly $7 billion per year. Over the same time, we expect to invest over $30 billion in BEV. And above the investment in BEV that\u2019s about 50% is CAPEX, 25% is expense, and 25% is direct investments. And these numbers, they'll be dynamic, and we are confident we have ample financial flexibility to increase our investments even if BEV adoption further accelerates.  And I'll let me share with you our early thinking about 2022, a year which like this one is likely to experience some industry crosswinds that could drive a range of outcomes that we typically don't talk about the upcoming year this soon. And we're not yet prepared to give financial guidance, but we do want to share how we're thinking about next year, given the dynamic operating environment. Ford's underlying strengths give me great confidence we can build on our results in 2021. First, our portfolio of products and services is exceptional. And we have a significant amount of new product coming to market spanning our iconic high-volume nameplate. Second, our industrial base gives us significant optionality as the adoption of electric vehicles accelerates.  Third, driven by the chip shortage of roughly 4 million in wholesales, we are likely to deliver this year fall significantly below our capacity. And based on our current assessment, we believe our wholesales to be up about 10% in 2022, but that number is very dynamic and changes almost weekly. And fourth, the effects of our global redesign, which is largely completed, are now evident and substantial.  We have drastically de -risked and rationalized our global footprint and product lineup, vastly improving our earnings and cash generation power in the process. Now for headwinds next year, it's difficult to predict the interplay between semiconductor-related constraints, volume and pricing and this will continue to remain dynamic.  For 2021, we expect commodities to be up 3 to 3.5 billion and they could be up another 1.5 billion in 2022, largely driven by steel and aluminum similar to this year. There will also likely be other inflationary costs, but it's too early to size that right now. Ford Credit is likely to be lower as strong auction values will be moderated by a smaller inventory of vehicles and lower lease end return rates.  And lastly, we're obviously going to continue to invest in our Ford Plus Plan for growth and value creation. And this includes in customer-facing technology, connectivity, and our always on relationships with customers, and electrification. And, of course, we believe long-term payback from those investments will be substantial. Now that wraps up our prepared remarks. And if you perceive that the upfront portion of these calls is becoming more efficient, well, you're right. And that's a function of us being very specific with you and our team about what's truly important, and our confidence in executing effectively against those things and reporting accordingly will use the balance of the time here and address what's on your mind. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good evening, everybody. Thanks for making the call efficient. I think it's going to be tough to limit to one question, but I will. If you think about the 10% increase you are talking about in 2022 wholesales, and if we could focus on North America and just assume you're going to do about 2 million units this year in '21, give or take. We're only talking about 200,000 units of increase next year. There's just an assumption that the price and mix will deteriorate an incremental units are produced semi shortage is relieved. But given that that's still gonna be a relatively low -- a very low level of production, do you believe that the price mix are really going to actually come under pressure next year and aren't we really going to stay in a very tight environment that you are selling through and not even building inventory if that's true, which means that pricing mix might stay very strong next year and we will still get the benefit. Thanks John. You're right. It's going to remain dynamic and that's what the interplay is going to be volume increases for the industry. They're higher, we'll probably see more pressure on price if they remain as they are today. And we see a moderate increase; I think you're going to continue to see strong pricing and mix continue through next year.  So that's where we have to stay disciplined and we have to stay very focused on managing that well so that we can have, as you said, the play-through next year relative to what happens from an overall volume standpoint, and we're focused on that. So I agree with you. That's going to be one of the key dynamic elements for next year. And just to follow-up on that. I think right now, based on wards, you have about 213,000 units in dealer inventory. Pre-COVID travel rate was about 650,000 units. You think about ultimately getting into a time where you can rebuild or restock that inventory, where do you think that runs, and how much opportunity is there to try to maintain some of this mix and price discipline to offset any cost inflation, and also invest in the future? John Lawler : Yeah, so if you look at where we ended in September, we ended at about 20 days\u2019 supply in the U.S. and we're watching it very closely from a day supply standpoint. In -- as we talked about last quarter, in our historical base supply was somewhere around 75 days. We're not going back there.  As Jim said, we're going to be very disciplined and we expect to be in the 50 days\u2019 supply when we're fully at full capacity and we're running and producing everything that we can, so that's gonna be the key. The other thing I would say, John, is that the move as we talked about in our remarks to having more of our sales come through orders, unlike orders in the order bank.  That's really important for us to manage our day supply. So it's a less of a scrounge stock push through and its customer demand pull-through based on the orders and we had over a 100,000 orders at the end of the quarter and that's grown since then in our order bank and that play well for us in the third quarter. Jim Farley : $139,454 order. John Lawler : As of -- as of today. Jim Farley : As of today. John Murphy : To be exact that's it sounds like you are on that and maybe if I could sneak one in just on cap allocation real quick on the dividend. I mean why now? And I'll hop back in the queue. Jim Farley : Yeah. It's the underlying strength of the business, John. And we're not capital constrained. We're able to fund our initiatives for growth. We know that there are going to be other opportunities that surface. We're confident that we can fund those. And we're focused on total shareholder returns. Not only stock appreciation, but also the dividend. And so given the strength of the business, the Board elected that we would restart the dividend this quarter. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Hey, good evening. Thank you for taking the question. I would like to just like to ask a question on the shape of recovery in volumes A, is this magnesium shortage going to cause any term -- any sort of near-term supply disruption for you?  I mean, we heard some during the comments that I could just outright stop European production and just maybe you can give us a sense broadly how you anticipate the shape of recovery in terms of volumes -- at what point do we get or is your baseline expectation that the chip shortages fully mitigated that you can be back at full run rate production? John Lawler : Yeah. So from the magnesium standpoint, when we look at that, we are seeing price pressure on aluminum broadly, we saw that all year and probably see a little bit more price pressure due to the magnesium issue, but our sheet metal suppliers -- our sheet aluminum suppliers don't purchase magnesium from China for North American production. So we don't see that having any significant impact or any impact on us.  We do see the chip issue continuing to run through 22, as we said, it's very dynamic. Right now, if you ask us what we think the sequential increase in supply will be year-over-year, we think we will have about 10% more, but that's changing weekly. And we're doing everything we can to get our hands on as many chips as we can. But we do see that running through 2022, it could extend into 2023, although we do anticipate the scope and severity of that to reduce as we move through 22 into 23. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. Second question. I'd like to be now, just a bit more strategic. Think if we just look at the pace of progress at Ford, just both financially and in terms of EV all things digital and just overseeing today is far greater than what you we saw 12 or 18 months ago, which is actually pretty impressive given the large organizations, it takes time to really affect change.  I just want to I'm trying understand how much of what we're seeing today was something that was always there and it's just always starting to come to the surface now, there's sort of getting the fruits of prior initiatives or has something fundamentally changed in the past 12, 18 months? What does this tell us about the pace of change at Ford has an extra period, maybe just to be a bit more specific, as I know, you can take that a number of ways. Maybe you can answer that specifically to what we're seeing on product and planning on the business trends with that transition EBITDA Jim Farley : Thank you for your question. A lot of the product we've been working on for several years, we made the tough choices. I would say the answer is we have a plan; it's not an advertising peer taglines. It's our plan, everyone in the Company knows what we have to do. We are out of time. And we have focused. We need to get an 8% margin like we did this quarter as a Company, regularly because we have to fund a high-growth BEV and digital business. It's not to make more money -- yes, it is that. But it's motivated in the mission of transforming Ford through these digital products. So running the ICE business for cash, getting serious about our cost, our quality, our launches, our 8% return. It's all a mission, and the team knows the plan and I think the culture is starting to change to be quicker, more accountability, less bureaucracy and that mission permeates through the Company.  I'm probably the worst person to ask whether something's changed, because it sure has changed for me, and my leadership team. But to me the proof is in the putting like our third quarter. And whether we really changed this Company will be proven out in our numbers over time, like to have the last year. Dan Levy : And then just to be more specific on the product front, because I think we're seeing a much faster pace of products. Is the time of developments, products, like how much have you accelerated that meaning typically in the past we would hear of 3.5 to 4 years of drawing boards that product and showroom. Is there a new normal for what that is? Jim Farley : If we make up our mind, and we come together as a team like we did on Maverick, it could be just 2 years. We did -- we knocked 20 months off the Maverick development, but it required the leadership team to not have the hand-wringing on the studio for 6 months, like we normally did. I think that's an improve point. But the question I ask myself is a little different.  When we see a technology change like this, like BEV, it's not just the speed of your product creation. It's can you be flexible and agile in your industrial system, like in manufacturing. We have 3 complete hits on our hands; a Mach-E with 200,000 units of demand, that's we have the Lightning with over a 160,000 orders and the transits completely sold out.  So how I like to think about it, it's not just a product creation speeding up the total Company. And we have to do our job to break constraints now, so that we can deliver hundreds of thousands of battery electric next year. That to me is the proof of our change, not just our faster product creation process works. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you very much, very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I thought to ask a few on the order bank, just given the commentary that it grew 50% sequentially in 3Q, excluding the Bronco. So can you talk about the benefits of the order bank? How it helps to optimize your operations? And what kind of pricing or other trends you might be seeing with regard to the order bank?  And then how much of the increase in orders do you think may stem from the currently very strong new product cadence or from the currently low inventory environment? And what avenues are there available to drive orders as industry conditions eventually normalize? Jim Farley : Thank you so much for your question. I'll ask John to comment. From my view, the order bank model that we're going to in North America that we're in right now, has benefits across the patch. We are an incredibly complicated Company. And so, having an order bank allows us to push simplification into the order that the customer facing options, which we need to do. And a reduces costs and improves our quality. Number 2, it eliminates the need for expensive conquest, fixed marketing. Number 3, it's incredibly helpful for industrial system. You cannot imagine Ryan how much money we waste by guessing what our launch mix is for new product. When you have an order bank special for new models. You could capacitize the high series mixes that are very profitable, right in line with customer demand. So it's incredibly cost-effective. And it allows you to address the long tail revenues that we've lost in the past because of our undrawn ground stock model. And the last one is its lower cost. There is less parts hanging around. We can manage our industrial system and our manufacturing and a leaner way. The question really is how we maintain it as you said, is the market improves and the way we are looking at that. Is not just having a day supply target in the past that we've managed, but actually putting in the infrastructure to maintain, or prefer an order-based system. That means we train our system to put in orders.  We reward people for putting in orders. We dynamically price for customers so that they are incentivized to keep ordering versus buying off the lot. So it's going to be a journey. It's been a very rewarding one so far. And we're just beginning. This is the model we have to go through as most of our business are -- majority of our business goes battery electric and digital. It's the right loyalty model. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great, thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up to that, it seems as was discussed earlier, that product development times are speeding up, maybe particularly with regard to EV is the Lightning, for example, seem to together very fast.  Another trend seems to be that automakers are revealing their EV's for a longer period of time before the actual start of production, maybe because there's so eager to show them consumers are so clamoring for them. Does that mean that you think that order banks and ordering in advance might be even more popular with electric vehicles? What are you seeing with regard to that? Jim Farley : The move to a digital product means we have to go to a 100% loyalty model. So the reason why you're seeing us launch battery electrics early is very simple. It's our Super Bollard. Our new Super Bollard, or new Detroit Motor Show is our reveal. because there's starts the clock on reservations and you have to do it early enough so you are industrial system gets informed by the results of your reservation. That's the closed loop that has to happen.  We need to open it early enough so that our industrial system can react to the orders and we don't waste money and take advantage of long tail revenue. And it's a more controlled environment than a broadcast media advertising on the Super Bowl. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Hi everybody. I have just 2 questions. So first you've got a lot of growth that you're targeting and in BEv's and digital businesses. So it's not surprising that we would see some structural cost inflation. What we're seeing right now is actually really benign.  It's 200 million and in the quarter, considering what you've got going on, but maybe can you talk a little bit about, how we should think about the feathering in of those additional structural costs, which presumably come in ahead of the revenue. So how should we think about that as we look out to the next year or 2? John Lawler : Yeah, Rod. We'll start to see those come in as we get into 22 and then they'll feather in to 23 as we continue to ramp our investments in our plan, our priorities. Not only in the products, the BEv's, but also as we're building out our customer facing technologies, our connectivity, etc. So yeah, you will see that start to come in on a year-over-year basis next year and it will continue into 23. Rod Lache : Can you just give us any sort of brackets around what I mean you did mention that 25% of the EBITDA spending will be expense, but any sort of thoughts on the magnitude of what that headwind is? John Lawler : Not -- I'm not ready to do that today for '22 and going in through '23. We're completely targeted on getting to that 8% in 2023, so we'll manage it within that. But today, I'm not ready to talk in that level of detail about. Rod Lache : Okay. And I was a little surprised about the comment about just 10% volume growth for next year. It seems to me like the Renesas fire in Texas storms alone might have not 200,000 units off of your production in Q2, and it wasn't too long ago you guys were routinely doing over 700,000 units a quarter. So do you have any thoughts that you might be able to share about when -- would you be able to get back up to that kind of a level of production, and if so, when should we expect that to happen? John Lawler : Right. I think what you'll find is that as you look through 2022, the first half will have less supply than through the second half. And as I said earlier, we see this mitigating over time. It may extend into 2023. But I would say that we should be back up and running based on what we're seeing today, our run rate, the end of next year into '23. And then in 2023, we'd start to rebuild our inventories.  But it's dynamic, Rod, and it's hard to make a pinpoint call at this point in time. But we wanted to share with you what we're seeing is that -- we're seeing about 10% for next year, and we see that the chip constraints is going to still...[Indiscernible] going to still be at [Indiscernible]. So we have to keep managing as we are this year. Rod Lache : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : 2 questions. First, a quick quite housekeeping, but definitely Balance Sheet question. As you stated the dividend at the level, just could you maybe talk us through the investment grade rating implications and timeline to get there that you are and the board considered when setting that. Jim Farley : So we're gonna continue to work and focus on improving our business, right? Our target is to have an investment-grade Balance Sheet, but that's going to come by improving the business, and you're seeing the strength of that come through. And so, that's what we're focused on. What the rating agencies to -- decide to do with our rating, they'll manage that.  That's up to them. What we're laser-focused on is improving the run rate of the business, improving our performance, improving our overall metrics, and eventually, the rating agencies and the ratings will take care of themselves. Brian Johnson : Okay. Second question. As you think about that 10% volume increase rough guidance. A couple of things One, where do you see fleet sales coming back as you kind of bring that up and second, are you going to take a different attitude towards fleet sales than in Ford of the past? I remember Don Leclair saying he had 2 factories making Tauruses and when took our companies, we're about the only buyer so that several.  But there are also really rental cars, but maybe some of the government business that's not pleased with not quite the same and related to that as you think about prioritizing production or their models where you're more comfortable, you'll get good price retention. And other models, and I'm gonna pick on like the escape maybe, that have a lot of competition in their segment. And as capacity comes back, less likely to hold price, say compared to our Bronco. John Lawler : So it's interesting because I remember those days when Don probably made that comment about rental fleets and that they were low margin, etc. I think what you're finding is business models are changing and the fleet business is evolving just like everything else in our industry. And we see that there could potentially be a positive fleet business where there could make good money. And so we're not going to shy away from that if we see that its right for our brand and we think is right for the bottom line. And so we're going to continue to look at fleets differently and we're going to continue to think about vehicles as-a-service and what that potential holds for us is that business model changes and we'll see where that takes us. But we're not going to go back to the times where we're putting in capacity; we're pumping out unit, selling them at little to no margin for rental cars. That's not going to happen again. Brian Johnson : I'm sorry. John Lawler : It's okay, I was just going to see our fleet business now. Now that we've rationalized the Company, our fleet business is very strategic for us. It's also very profitable. It certainly varies in Europe, and North America, and China. Different fleet segments have different profitability. The one thing I would ask you to think about is that most of fleet that matters at Ford is commercial vehicles.  And the most important commercial vehicles for us are small, medium-sized businesses. And those are very profitable business for us, for transit, for super duty. That's where Ford excels in the fleet business. And it's smaller fleets, it's not big fleet sales. So the texture of this is that we're revenue managing the Company very carefully.  We know the margins by geography, even within the country and we know by distribution channel. So this is a very thoughtful approach for us, but strategically, especially because of the Pro business and its profitability, we want to make sure we have where reliable partner with fleet customers.  They do business with companies that are reliable, that don't come in and out of the market, they do business with companies that have a full range of products, a full range of services. That's why Marion is investing in Ford Pro, and why we're vertically integrating our services. Jim Farley : So I think we have a really good, profitable fleet business around the world. We look at the margins very carefully, but it's strategically very important for the Company to be a reliable partner. Brian Johnson : Okay. And then in terms of price retention and how that's going to vary, caution product line? Jim Farley : Well, John, I think you should you should answer that one in terms of how we revenue manage in a constrained environment. John Lawler : Yeah. So as you would expect, we're very conscientious about the dynamic of the supply and demand and the impact that has on the pricing and we look at this on a daily basis managing our incentives, looking at if we should be taking top-line pricing given the inflationary pressures we're seeing.  As we talked about, we're not going to go back to the old habits of loading of the dealers with stock and then looking through the push through for sales, were going to focus more on orders coming through online. Specific orders to customers being satisfied, understanding what their demands are, simplifying the system.  And with all of that, we expect to retain quite a bit of a price. Now will it mitigate as we go through next year as supply and demand comes more in Bell and in '23? Yes. But our job is going to be to manage that and retain as much pricing as we can. And while providing customers good value for those products. So it's something that we look at very closely on a daily basis. Brian Johnson : Thank you. Jim Farley : In the Escape business, we now have another player called Bronco Sport, in a segment. It's incredibly profitable and people really appreciate the product. We're know in the business of commodity products in that segment anymore, we changed, we made investments several years ago. Brian Johnson : Right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to clarify, as part of your original guidance was that the first -- the second half was supposed to be up in volume 30%. I mean, I'm not sure if I'm misreading it, it sounds like Q3 maybe up a bit from Q4. So is that 30% still not accurate? Obviously, it's important when you think about the 10% to 2022 web-based are going off. John Lawler : Yeah, Colin, that's a great question. Thank you. Now, we did say last quarter that we expected the second half to be up about 30% looks like it's going to be up somewhere around 15%. And so what you're seeing flow-through is the strength we had in the quarter relative to the top line and other actions that we took relative to cost, etc.  So when you look at that walk, that bridge between Q3 to Q4, we expect market factors to be positive. We also said, we think volume is going to be up sequentially about 10% and also see a little bit stronger, stronger mix continuing, and then of course you'll have some product-related costs, production-related costs associated with that. But net -- net market factors, net of those costs to produce the increased volumes is going to be positive. We're seeing from a headwind standpoint, if you look at Q3 to Q4 our commodities, we expect that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, they are going to be up about $700 million. And if you look at that so far, year-to-date, we've seen about $1.6 billion of commodities hit us. When you get to the Fourth Quarter.  You can get the Cumulus factor that on a year-over-year basis, commodities are going to be up about another billion five in the Fourth Quarter. Year-over-year up a billion five sequentially, up $700 million.  And then we are going to see some higher warranty costs on a sequential basis in the Fourth Quarter for things that we have to take care of around extended warranties and a little bit higher coverages. But again, on a year-over-year basis, our warranty will improve in the fourth quarter. In full-year, on a year-over-year basis, our warranty, we expect to be good by about a billion for. Colin Langan : Got it. Right. That's very helpful. John Lawler : So does that help you with the bridge? Colin Langan : Yes -- no, that's great. I just -- secondly, in terms of the redesign plan that's been out for a while, is India the last major step? I mean, is this going to sort of -- is this it, or next quarter may be the last time we see these slides? Just kind of curious. Or is there more still coming? Jim Farley : Well, I think we're in good shape for now. Obviously the acceleration of the BEV business, and our ICE assets will be, I think the next big transition for the whole industry, not just Ford. But Ford specifically, India's really the principal region country where we have struggled over time.  And it's really great to see the progress the team is making in India and the very vibrant position will now have with the new lineup. And I'd just like to highlight the progress in North America for this quarter. John when's last time we were profitable in South America? John Lawler : I believe it was 2013. Jim Farley : So let -- let's hang that in the air for 2013. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC. Joseph Spak : Thank you. Maybe just one quick one on the free cash guidance or so. I think you maintained despite the EBITDA guidance went higher. So is there something going on with working capital because you're, you're saying you're releasing more vehicles, so I wouldn't think that would actually be positive factor in the fourth quarter as well as from curious what the offset is. John Lawler : Yeah. So what we're seeing there is that we've got the EBITDA coming in, right that improvement, but the less favorable improvement in working capital and timing differences hitting us in the quarter. Because we have lower than anticipated volume in the back half of the quarter due to the chip constraints, and so we get with that working capital at the end of the year. So that's what's happening to us on the free cash flow, so it's a timing issue. Joseph Spak : Okay, and then I want to go back to some of the announcements you've made over the past couple of months and you talked again about the spend today. And end up spending more than 30 billion. And I appreciate the breakdown you gave us, sort of how you're spending that.  Maybe this is just me but I actually find it still fairly difficult to track what exactly you're spending over the coming year because I believe some of that has already been spent. So is it possible to maybe just say like olive that 30 billion, what's being spent, like starting next year through the middle of the decade? John Lawler : So of the 30 billion, when you look at the cap, very little. We said about half of that was cap. Very little of that has been spent through 2021 relative to the 13 to 15 billion, about half of it. Of course, you're going to see the expense front-loaded because that's primarily be engineering that we have in developing the battery electric vehicles.  And then the direct investment, which is about 25% of it bats with things like the virtual go integration of J.D. and those types of things. And you saw those announcements this quarter with our plan in BlueOvalSK, the battery plans. That's how we're going to unfold that bad spending over time. Joseph Spak : That's helpful. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thanks. Good evening, everybody. Two quick ones from me. First, is there any update on the BlueCruise deployment, including through OTA, maybe some initial customer feedback? Jim Farley : Great. Thank you. We're shipping with marquee F-Series now BlueCruise as they leave the factory and we're going to be OTA in BlueCruise in the first quarter. We wanted to improve the customer experience, so we've pushed it back in terms of an OTA because we wanted to be much simpler for the customer than was originally planned and that takes a little planning to consolidate. Often these level 2 systems require multiple updates in the car. We wanted to be very simple that took a little bit more work on our team's part, and so it's available. as we ship products now and as in OTA, it'll be in the first quarter and it will be a lot simpler to use. And get that OTA and update for the customer than it was originally planned. Does that answer your question? Itay Michaeli : Yeah. That's very helpful. And then maybe just does super quick follow-ups, just a point of clarification. Thank you for 2022 initial indications. And at least you mentioned you expect to build on the strong performance in 2021. I am just curious if that if we should interpret that as you expect to grow EBITDA adjusted year-over-year in 2022. John Lawler : Yeah so we're not going to give a number at this point and say, but what we're saying is that the strength of our new product lineup, our high-volume nameplates like in the strength of what we're seeing Rod Lache, as Jim said, we think there's about demand for 200,000 units. We've got the Bronco, Maverick, E-Transit, and F-150 Lightning is coming. It's the best lineup that we had, and so that's going to be a tailwind for us for sure as we go into next year. You're seeing that come through this year, and we're going to build on that. But we're also going to have to manage the headwinds that we've talked about.  And the other puts and takes but what we can tell you is we are laser-focused on getting to the 8% target in 2023. And so we will manage into next year. These are the types of things we're seeing from a puts and takes standpoint strength, the tailwinds and headwinds. And we will manage that next year and will be on the path next year towards our 8% target in 2020. Itay Michaeli : Great, that's super helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much and good evening. 2 questions please. John Lawler : Good evening. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi, two questions. The first one very pleased to see beyond target and for this 8% margins by 2023, big focus of the Company and clearly showing some progress there. How should we think about the impact on this from the margins on your electric vehicles? Obviously, the scale takes some time to build up, but Europe going through that right now, and probably has some level of visibility.  What are what's really leader thinking around trajectory for margins on some of your EVs, and to what extent you will, or will not impact overall Company margins, and potentially, how do we think about it beyond 2023? Jim Farley : Thanks, such an important question for the Company. I'd like John to comment on the margins. Right now, we have 3 high-volume. Very well accepted battery electric vehicles on our hands. Mach-E, E-Transit and the F - F-150 Lightning. So the way we look at it is we want to grow this business really fast. Just the Mach-E demand itself we think is 200 thousand units that do not include the Lightning or the E-Transit.  Our first job is course post-job one customer experience improvement. Post-job one simplification and improvement of the cost vehicle and post-job one quality improvements using the data off the vehicles. Perhaps our biggest job in my opinion, is to break the constraints we have in manufacturing and our supply chain, so we can get these products out to these customers.  That post-job one orientation is quite different than how we historically looked at the ice business where we wait to a minor change or something later to make those changes. The constraint for Mach-E right now as batteries, we think we can break some of those constraints by working creatively with our China team and get our batteries from China. So stay tuned and I'll ask John to comment on the margins. John Lawler : As we talked about last quarter Mach-E is EBITDA profitable today, but we also know that the margins are not as strong as our ICE margins. And so we're working on that. Overtime we expect as we scale, as you said and as the technology costs come down, we will grow those margins and ultimately, we do expect with these connected vehicles is connected bands that the profit margins will be better than what we're seeing on ICE today but that's over time. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you. And then my second question was on Argo. So [Indiscernible] you see that you would like to encourage them as supportive of accessing the public markets. How do you envisage the future relationship between Ford and our book to be how important and is that going to be as part of your overall business model? Jim Farley : Mission critical for us to truly disrupt personal ownership. We have to democratize shared mobility. And the self-driving and mobility in the driven world are absolutely mission-critical for the Company and disruptive itself. I am really proud of the team's progress. It's different than our competitors in the space. We've gone to the most difficult miles in 4 or 5 different cities.  Our mapping, our SDS deployment, and the algorithms are built to be scaled for production deployment. So we're not going to a small market area and easy miles like others. We're taking on the toughest problems now and building our capability for scaling quickly. And I think that's always been our approach. The relationship with Argo and us and Volkswagen is very close, but we do see us moving into more of a production mode now. And we're really ready for that. And we think this will take capital and little more time. and we think the access to public capital is really mission-critical for our journey. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you. Operator : Final question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : I think explained as [Indiscernible] all this on in the [Indiscernible] the way you have. Right. So you get curious for that. You're saying some of the competitors, critical investments in the downstream to make up for that customer experience, Volkswagen buying your car, and some stocks including ones that you know pretty well. Kind of part of it. Was there any gap in your strategy [Indiscernible] really [Indiscernible] is vertically integrate [Indiscernible] franchises [Indiscernible] suspicion given the change in [Indiscernible] tax. Jim Farley : Great question. Our philosophy is different. We think partnerships on the demand layer for our autonomy and Priya autonomy is making critical for our always on strategy. Are there pieces missing that we're working really hard on [Indiscernible]? We're not going to talk about it today though. Adam Jonas : Alright [Indiscernible] that might be [Indiscernible] because [Indiscernible] with [Indiscernible] starting to see Candle GPU [Indiscernible]. We're big chunk of the price of got a question. Do you think there's [Indiscernible] that you can capture [Indiscernible] the consumer? Jim Farley : Well, this is also really important. First of all, I would say the heart and soul of Ford strategy is our commercial business. And that business where vehicles are highly utilized. Our dealer network is one of our most important advantages versus the new competitors. I will give you some statistics.  We have 650 dedicated commercial, mostly service centers in the U.S. in 850 transit centers across Europe. So that will take a lot of time and a lot of money for someone to recreate. Every one of those dealers has multiple bodybuilders that can call design for those trades. And those vacation locations for our Ford vehicles.  So the dealer body is not only important for the after sales experience and making sure those vehicles can be serviced but it's also mission-critical for the outfit of those products. The dealer network is absolutely strategically critical for our leadership and maintaining that as we go to digital connected vehicles for our commercial customers. There's no doubt that many customers want us 3 or 4 clicks very easy service experience on the retail side. We're working really carefully on that, including a simple e-commerce platform. And actually in China, our BEV business already has 25 direct stores by the end of this year. So we're starting to experiment.  I think our dealers and served us really well. I'm very proud of them. I'm especially proud of our commercial dealer and we're, we're very vigilant. You can imagine I get lots of e-mails every day about transaction prices from customers on our hottest products. And we all feel obligated to represent the brand professionally for our customers. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Jim.

And on Thursday February 24, Bob Holycross our Vice President Sustainability, Environment and Safety Engineering; and Dave Webb Ford's Treasurer will participate in the RBC Global Environmental Social and Governance Conference. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim Farley. Jim Farley : Thanks, Lynn. Hello everyone. Well, some may have described 2021 as a breakthrough year for Ford, I would simply portray it as a year of important progress for the company. We strengthened our base business last year and now expect to deliver even stronger results this year. And just as critical, we started moving with real speed and ambition to build a modern Ford. Our true breakthroughs are still ahead of us, like rapidly scaling production of our popular new battery electric vehicles, like turning Ford Pro a new growth engine for our commercial customers businesses and ours, like building our intelligent software platform to revolutionize our customers' experience. Even with the recent momentum, I know some observers may remain skeptical that a 118-year-old company like Ford will emerge as a winner in these disruptive times in our industry. And I'm okay with that. We're going to compete like a challenger, speak with our actions, prove ourselves over time. So let's dive into last year. As I mentioned, we have significantly improved our base business. In North America, our largest market, we have a very hot portfolio of new vehicles. We've now won awards of North America Truck and Utility of the Year for two years running. That's never happened by any company. The new Bronco, the Bronco Sport, the Maverick, the Mustang Mach-E all of them brand-new name plates for our lineup all, all of them kits. Last month, we launched E-Transit. In the spring, we're in the middle of launching F-150 Lightning. Few people ask us any more about why we phased out sedans and many more asking when they could take delivery of the new Bronco or Maverick or Lightning. So we're doing everything we can in our powers to increase our production and break constraints. We don't like making our customers wait and we're taking action to ensure that they don't pay unreasonable markups. We've also made progress outside of North America and this is very important. Ford has been a one-legged stool for too long. We stayed in Europe and South America and other regions, because we really believe we can create sustainably strong businesses in those markets. And we want to serve these customers with better, more connected and electric products and services. The deep restructuring in Europe and South America have put us in a position to grow profitability going forward. In China, we're now set up to play a much bigger role in the EV boom going on there. We've quietly grown Lincoln into a strong contender in the world's largest luxury vehicle market. In fact, China is now the number one Lincoln market globally. Our international markets group is profitable and we're now preparing for the important launch of our next-generation Ranger pickup this year. While we remain in the teeth of the COVID crisis and semiconductor shortages, our overall business is still in great shape. And at the same time, we're rapidly making progress on key aspects of the Ford+ plan. And for customers that means more distinctive products and solutions, more always on relationships with our brands and adding ever-improving user experiences. Now to deliver these things, we're building new muscles and that certainly includes scaling up our production of electric vehicles as I mentioned. We under-called the demand for our first wave of EVs. The Mustang Mach-E, the E-Transit, the F-150 Lightning. In the past six months, we doubled our 2023 planned capacity for EVs to 600,000 units a year. Now this required everything from working with SK and LG to increase battery supplies to knocking down walls at our Rouge electric vehicle center, while the mortar was still wet to make room to improve and build more Lightnings. Our team knows how to scale manufacturing and we're now harnessing that capability to ramp up production of EVs. We also have a task force dedicated to lowering the bill of materials for our bets above and beyond just the usual declines in material costs. For example, on Mustang Mach-E, in just the last month, our team found $1000 of opportunity per vehicle. And that's delivered through design simplification, vertical integration and leveraging our scale with supply chain as we ramp up production. And that team is just getting started. We plan to take full advantage of our first-mover position in the fully electric pickup truck market starting with Lightning, but there's much more to come. In the coming months, we'll break ground on the Blue Oval City electric truck plant in Tennessee. It will be the largest, the most advanced manufacturing complex in our history, and it will produce Ford's second generation of a full-sized electric pickup in high volumes starting in 2025. And at the same time, we have three large-scale battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky, which will be coming on stream with capacity to produce enough battery cells for more than 1 million vehicles a year. This is in addition to our battery sourcing in China and Europe. We are well on our way to achieve at least a 40% mix of BEVs by 2030 with strong margins and equal to our higher market share in the key high-profit high-volume segments we compete. For example, the F-150 Lightning, if we had full production today to meet our current demand, we would rival the Model Y as the leading BEV nameplate in the U.S. market. We can't grow a profitable BEV business without a very healthy ICE business. And to do this, we're reducing complexity everywhere, while increasing, leveraging the benefits of our connectivity. Now this includes things like fewer top hats guided by customer demand and a judicious approach to vehicle content based on deep insights generated from that same vehicle data. We're also being disciplined with capital as we deploy that to our ICE products recognizing that as a mix of BEVs increases, we will continue to manufacture ICE vehicles but with a focus on optimizing cash returns. So our goal is to continue to improve our automotive EBIT margins. Let me say that again. Our goal is to continue to improve our auto EBIT margins even as we ramp up the mix of BEVs. In 2021, we began to bring our vision of an always on experience for retail and commercial customers to life. Our customers are realizing the benefits of our over-the-air software updates. But that's just the beginning. We're using our hubs in places like Palo Alto to attract more and more great software engineers and technology specialists. And we're fundamentally changing the culture of engineering inside Ford. The hardware will always be important, but the software and the embedded systems will define the next generation of our vehicles' experiences. I think customers will be amazed at the benefits as we move to central compute rather than the distributed compute we have across all the supplier-provided modules today. Our human-centered interface professionals are now in one single organization with authority over the in-car digital experiences, interfaces, screens and controls. And we're committed to providing an environment where software engineers can do the very best work of their careers. Before I turn it over to John, let me close, the velocity of change at Ford is increasing. We're not seeking half measures. Fear of change and risk has never served legacy automakers well in the past couple of decades. We're done with incremental change. We have a clear plan, a bias fraction and whatever-it-takes mindset. We're confident our strong base business will generate the capital we need to fund a very exciting future. We're recruiting incredible talent from outside the company to work with the best people from Ford. As excited as our customers are for that great portfolio we have in the market today, we can't wait to show them what's coming in the future. Now I'll turn it over to John, who will take you through the results for the quarter and our expectations for this year. John Lawler : Thank you, Jim. In the face of ongoing challenges with semiconductor constraints, and industry-wide supply chain disruptions, we executed our Ford+ plan, including closing out our global redesign, strengthening our product portfolio and investing in exciting new opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. For the year, we posted $10 billion in adjusted EBIT, with a margin of 7.3%. That's our strongest performance since 2016. We delivered right at the midpoint of our guidance range adjusting for the re-class of our first quarter Rivian game to a special item. And despite a 6% decline in wholesale, our automotive business posted its strongest EBIT margin since 2016. North America delivered an 8.4% EBIT margin, and is firmly on the glide path to a 10% EBIT margin. In addition, our operations outside the US collectively posted their best results since 2017. I'm very proud of the team's hard work, the resiliency last year as we rose to the challenge and optimized constrained production to protect customer orders, new launches, our electrification strategy, and our most profitable vehicles. We also remain highly disciplined with our incentive spend, and mix management, which combined with improvement in warranty costs, more than offset commodity headwinds and supply chain-related production losses. Ford Credit, whose profits and dividends are an important source of capital for us delivered a strong year. EBT was $4.7 billion, as auction values were at record highs and credit losses were near record lows. Free cash flow was $4.6 billion, and we ended the year with strong cash and liquidity more than $36 billion and $52 billion respectively, which now includes our stake in Rivian valued at $10.6 billion at the end of the year. In 2021, we continue to advance our capital strategy given the improvements we're seeing in the underlying business. We reinstated the regular dividend at $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter as we continue to focus on creating value for our shareholders. We also further strengthened our balance sheet by repurchasing $7.6 billion of high-cost debt, deleveraging the balance sheet and significantly reducing our ongoing interest expense. We introduced the industry's first fully integrated sustainable financing framework covering both an auto OEM and its captive finance company. And in November, following the launch of the framework we completed our inaugural $2.5 billion green bond issuance, which was met with incredible investor demand and will help fund our exciting BEV portfolio. Our strong balance sheet including cash, provides a solid foundation to continue to invest in our Ford+ priorities. So let me briefly touch on the fourth quarter. With a margin of 5.4%, adjusted EBIT was $2 billion and we generated $2.3 billion in free cash flow. Some modeled stronger EBIT for us in this quarter. We know that was largely driven by higher volume expectations relative to the 10% sequential increase, we guided to in October and lower corporate other expenses. North America delivered $1.8 billion of profit with a margin of 7.1%. Volume was up 10% on a sequential basis, as supply chain constraints eased and custom demand for our products remained strong. South America delivered a modest profit for the second consecutive quarter and the business is now set up to deliver sustainable profitability. With restructuring of the legacy business complete, the region is now focused on strengthening Ford's position in the truck market, growing its new commercial vehicle business and enriching customer experiences. In Europe, the underlying trajectory of our business continues to accelerate towards a 6% EBIT margin. However, the adverse effect of near-term supply chain disruption continues to mask that improvement. Importantly we were the number one commercial vehicle brand in Europe for the seventh consecutive year and transit continues to have an extremely healthy order bank. Mustang Lockheed sales in the region are off to a strong start with the order bank building momentum as we accelerate the transition to BEV. In China, Lincoln continues to be a real bright spot and gain share in the highly profitable and growing premium segment. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record sales of the brand in China, contributing to an almost 50% increase for the year. We are expanding the Lincoln portfolio in 2022 with the launch of the all-new Zephyr. The order bank for that vehicle opened recently and is off to a fast start. In the fourth quarter we also achieved an important electrification milestone in China as we began local production and customer deliveries of the Mustang Mach-E. Our direct-to-customer model for Mach-E allows people to order online and through 25 Ford select city stores. Our international markets group performed well in the fourth quarter and had a record year playing to its strengths especially from our flagship Ranger pickup, which delivered full year segment share of 14.9% up 1.1 percentage points year-over-year. We also announced major investments in both South Africa and Thailand to modernize production and launch the next-generation Ranger from four assembly plants later this year. And in mobility, we've made steady progress towards the scaled commercialization of moving people and moving goods and we are confident in Argo's progress in delivering a Level 4 autonomous vehicle solution. And in addition, we are rationalizing our investment portfolio and focusing on autonomous development. Now, I'll share with you our current thinking about 2022. We expect supply constraints to remain fluid throughout the year, reflecting a variety of factors including semiconductors and COVID. Based on what we see now, we believe our full year wholesales will be up about 10% to 15% in 2022 with a high single to low digit decline in the first quarter, reflecting supplier shortages related to Omicron shutdown and semiconductors. For the full year, we expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT and that's up 15% to 25% versus 2021. And the high end of the range equates to an adjusted company EBIT margin of 8% and our North America business at 10% EBIT margin, which if we achieve would be one year earlier than the target we shared with you last May. Now turning to GAAP results for a minute. It's important to point out that each quarter we will mark-to-market our investment in Rivian, which sits in cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet. This is not something we can forecast. The mark-to-market may cause volatility in our quarterly GAAP net income and EPS results. So looking at how our adjusted EBIT guidance rolls up. Our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America and collected profitability outside of North America, as we realize the full benefits of our global redesign efforts. We also expect Ford Credit EBT to be strong, but lower than 2021 profits, and we expect mobility and corporate other EBIT to be roughly flat. Lastly, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of between $5.5 billion and $6.5 billion. Now, other assumptions we factored into our guidance include. First, we expect customer demand enthusiasm to remain strong for our new and iconic nameplates. We will have a full year of production of the award-winning Bronco and Maverick, in addition to a robust BEV lineup, with Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit and F-150 Lightning all in production. Second, with wholesales up about 10% to 15%, we anticipate the pricing environment to remain strong, although the interplay between volume and pricing will remain dynamic. Third, we expect commodity headwinds of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Fourth, we anticipate other inflationary pressures, which will impact a broad range of costs. And fifth, at Ford Credit, we expect auction values to remain strong in 2022, as supply constraints persist. However, as I mentioned, we anticipate lower EBT reflecting primarily non-recurrence of reserve releases, fewer returned off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses. Most importantly, we're committed to our Ford+ plan and we'll continue to invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation. This includes devoting resources to customer-facing technology, connectivity, our always on relationships with customers and electrification. We are confident the long-term payback from those investments will be substantial. So that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to hear and address what's on your mind. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is going to come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. John Murphy : Good evening, everybody. Thanks for the time tonight. Just a first question. Jim, there's been a lot of speculation that you might consider spinning a portion of the future car business whether it be EV or AV with Argo. But there's also the backside of that that might make more sense to spin some of your legacy ICE assets and have the entire company become a more pure-play EV/AV company in totality. So I mean, how do you think about this and what would you be your motivations either way? And how you -- I mean how are you strategizing this? Jim Farley : Thanks, John. Yes, I don't want to speculate on rumors or speculate on the speculation in the press. But I will go back to something we said and I've said over and over again which is, running a successful ICE business and the successful BEV business are not the same. The customers are different. We think the go-to-market is going to have to be different. The product development process and the kinds of products we develop are different. The procurement supply chain are all different. The talent is different. The level of in-sourcing is different. And actually the rhythm of the business is different -- fundamentally different. So I'm not going to talk about speculation in the press, but I will tell you that the way we're operating the businesses acknowledges those differences. And I'm really excited about the company's commitment to operate the businesses as they should be. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : Hi, everybody. I wanted to ask you a little bit about margins. As John said, it looks like you guys will hit 8% if you hit the high end of your target range. And Jim, you said that you're targeting improving margins from here. So maybe you can give us a little bit more color on that how we should think about it? I'm not sure that 8% is the benchmark anymore, just given how many years ago that's been and how many changes there are to the business. You're ramping up a lot of spending on engineering and spending up in EV infrastructure, but you're also going to grow the Ford Pro business. So maybe you can just give us some of the puts and takes how to think about it? And as part of it, if you might just give us a data point on where Ford Pro stood in 2021. John Lawler : Yes. Hi, Rod, it's John. So I guess I would say that -- as Jim just said that, we're looking at the ICE business and the BEV business and we're managing both differently. When you look at the ICE transition, I think there are still a lot of opportunities for us to improve that business. We're very focused on reducing our structural costs. We've done a lot already, but there's a lot more that we think we can do there. We're looking at operating with much lower stock levels as our business continues to develop. So we'll operate at leaner inventories than we have in the past which will help our top line and continue to strengthen that top line. We're improving our quality which is important. We saw that come through this year from a year-over-year warranty standpoint it was down roughly $1.4 billion. And we want to be at the top in quality in every segment and that's going to have opportunity for the business. We're also working to revitalize our business through our digital capabilities, leveraging what we have from the connected vehicle to improve warranty even further, as well as improve what we're doing from a manufacturing standpoint and leverage that technology to bring those types of cost down. There's opportunities in maximizing our parts business and we're going to lower our distribution costs. There's opportunity there. So we see that over time, as we manage the ICE business, there's opportunity to improve margins even further from there. And then when you talk about BEV, so as we've talked about in past calls, our BEV margins are not where we intend it to be. We have opportunity, but we need to do that through scaling them, right? We're not going to chase top hats. We're going to look at scale. We're going to want to have a strong lineup where we can lean into it with key vehicles in high-volume segments like we are today with Mustang Mach-E, the Lightning and in our commercial vehicles with the Transit. We're going to reduce complexity, right? We know that one of the things that we need to do on our vehicles and we saw that, as Jim talked about, with the team finding $1,000 a unit on Mach-E and they just got started is that, we need to approach the design of these vehicles differently. And that's what's really important about having the first-mover advantage there. We're on the road with these. We're in production with these. We understand what we need to do in that second generation and we're off doing that right now improving what we have on the road today and really bringing that knowledge into our second-generation design. And then as I said earlier on the ICE business, we're going to leverage the compute on the vehicles to really lower our manufacturing costs and leverage that compute to simplify what we do coming down the line and bring that down to the bottom line of the vehicle. And then distribution. We all know the difference in the distribution cost for the legacy system that's out there versus what we see with other manufacturers. So that's an opportunity for us to work with our partners to improve that. So on both of those we see opportunities. And then as you said, Rod, there's opportunities to grow our business and lean into our leading position in commercial vehicles with Ford Pro. And we're looking to grow that business to $45 billion in revenues by 2025. And so I think there's opportunities across both of our key segments and with Ford Pro to improve the business as we move forward beyond the 8%. And now we need to stay extremely focused and relentless on that execution. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Sam Levy with Credit Suisse. Dan Levy : Hi. Thank you. It\u2019s Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. I'd like to ask about your JV with GlobalFoundries, and just broadly about what you're trying to do with electronic components and sort of the notion of simplification, which you've talked more about. So we've heard that with GlobalFoundries, I think, Hau Thai-Tang mentioned, you'd like to control more of the sub-sourcing to suppliers. You'd like to dictate more of the design of some of the electronic products that in the past have been handled by the suppliers. Maybe you could help us unpack this. How significant of a change is this in your operating model where you frankly focused on just the core vehicle itself and outsourcing where you can? How achievable is this especially given you're concurrently undergoing this transition to EV? And broadly, how should we think of the financial implications given you're going from what's been more of a just-in-time approach on inventory and components to now more of a just in case and deeper in the supply chain? Thank you. Jim Farley : Thank you for your question. Perhaps the biggest gift for all the pain we're going through now in semiconductors is that we have very painfully learned the lesson that we cannot manage the supply chain for these key components as we have. In fact you could argue that in the change of transition to these digital electric vehicles that supply chain could be one of the biggest advantages a particular company has or doesn't have. The way we look at it is the key electric components memory chips semiconductors. I would break semiconductors into two types. I'll come back with GlobalFoundries in a second. Feature-rich chips that we still use a lot. A window regulator doesn't need to have a 4-nanometer chip. And the advance -- but we also have sensors power electronics for our inverters, the batteries themselves all the way back to the mine, the inverters of different battery. Chemistries itself have different raw materials and kind of ecosystems that support them. So this is a very important topic for the company. How different it is? It's really different. We need different talent at the company. We need physical inspection of the actual producers. We need direct contracts with them. We need to design the SoC ourselves. We need to direct in the case -- in some cases to even direct prefer build to print or actually use supplier XYZ to get out of where we've been. And this takes talent. It takes a different approach. It takes more resources. On GlobalFoundries, it's kind of the first big bet, but there'll be many, many more coming for us. We're very dependent on TSMC for our feature-rich nodes. Obviously, the capacity is at risk over time as the industry moves to more advanced nodes including us. And as I said we're going to need feature-rich nodes for many years to come. GlobalFoundries knows how to build them. They know to build them in the United States. We can partner with the government depending on the CHIPS Act to capacitize here. It will be a few years until we benefit from that but it's a really big thing to descale ourselves on the feature-rich chips from the current ecosystem that we depend on around the world. And I think GlobalFoundries is a really interesting deal when we get into the details. We have to put cash up when we participate. Those feature-rich semis will be used by other companies industrial companies, not just Ford. It's a really interesting deal. And I was talking to the US company. You can expect the same kind of thing on advanced nodes and all the other components I mentioned including more deals on the raw material for various types of battery chemistry. And this is a culture change at Ford. As I said this is part of the rhythm change between ICE and BEV. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Slide 20 shows you with $36.5 billion of cash and investments which might be a record, but it is certainly the most that I can remember and compares to I think like five-plus years ago you used to talk about wanting to have cash of something closer to in excess of $20 billion with like another $10 billion or $13 billion of more liquidity on top of that. I get that there's more uncertainty now with the pandemic and the chip shortage. And of course you're investing heavily for electrification. Despite those investments though, I mean you're still calling for $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion of FCF this year versus the dividend costs like $1.5 billion or $1.6 billion. So, with the current trajectory it seems like the record cash pile should only grow bigger in 2022. I'm just curious what your thoughts are on this whether you have any updated thoughts on the optimal capital structure over what time or under what conditions you might move towards that more optimal capital structure. And it being so far above the earlier targeted cash balance might influence how you go about deciding what to do with the Rivian stake once the lockup expires. John Lawler : Thanks Ryan. So, yes we're really pleased with the position we have from a cash standpoint because it gives us the flexibility to invest in the business as we go. We've talked about the investments we'll be making in BEVs. We'll be breaking capacity contains and we're going to continue to focus on scaling as quickly as we can. The other thing we need to think about is the supply chain for our BEVs. There's opportunities potentially for vertical integration. There's opportunities for looking beyond as we move into these connected vehicles with more advanced electronics, potentially leveraging capital to secure supply chain there. So, there's a lot of opportunities as we move forward to leverage this cash to improve the business. We're also focused on our shareholders. And of course, total shareholder returns is important as well. So we're going to continue to provide dividends to our consumers -- to our shareholders, which is important for us as we move forward given our shareholder base. So I think what you'll see is that, that cash balance is going to be a benefit for us, as we look to grow the business, as we look to expand, as we look to vertically integrate, as we look to secure our supply chain and we continue to develop our Ford+ plan. Ryan Brinkman : Very interesting. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you, very much. Good evening. I wanted to ask you a little bit more detail related to two items in the 2022 outlook. The first one is your volume and mix assumption. In the fourth quarter when I look at the North American walk, your wholesale were up something like 60,000 units year-over-year, but the volume mix piece of your North American bridge was up only $100 million and that's despite what F-150 may be up like 34% year-over-year, if [Indiscernible] is right. And so just curious what's going on in terms of mix and why that contribution didn't really flow through to the EBIT. And how do you think about, as you grow your volume 10% to 15% in 2022, what kind of EBIT contribution can we expect from this? That's the first item. And then the second one is in terms of additional investment costs, so you've quantified a step-up in CapEx for 2022. I'm just curious if there are things in the income statement that you're able to quantify in terms of additional investments in technology that we should think about as we model 2022? John Lawler : So let me focus on 2022 first. So looking at the walk for 2022, you have to think about the 10% to 15% in the volume growth, but mix is also a strong part of that on a year-over-year basis. We expect to see continued strong mix. Pricing, as I said in my remarks, we do expect the continued strong pricing environment. So when you look at volume mix and pricing, we expect that to be up about $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion. And so I'll just walk through what -- where we see that on the bridge to 2022. We are continuing to invest in modernization and that was along with our product related spending, as we're continuing to build out our BEV business. That's about $1.5 billion headwind, but that's broadly offset with other efficiencies that we're working on. You also see that commodities are going to be a headwind next year of about $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And then Ford Credit is going to be strong, but we do expect them to be down about $1.5 billion. And then of course, we've got lower net pension income. So we expect the top line to be strong with the volume increase. We continue to expect to have strong mix. And then we expect pricing to be a strength as well on a year-over-year basis. Operator : All right. And our next\u2026 Jim Farley : Sorry, what's nice about what we're seeing this year or our forecast this year is, we're seeing good profit leverage from that incremental top line. And I think that's very encouraging. We have lost statistics about how that compares in the past, but that hasn't always been the case at Ford. It's great to see that top line flow into our profitability increase. Operator : Thank you. And our next question is going to come from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Just following up on the walk. If I actually annualize Q4, you're running at only $8 billion. What was particularly weaker about this quarter as a sort of starting point? It's also sort of down sequentially on higher sales. Is that seasonality, higher commodity costs hitting worse this quarter? Any color there? John Lawler : From a quarter-over-quarter basis and what \u2013 how the quarter developed, we hit the midpoint of the guidance. And one of the things is I think some expected volumes to be up higher than what we had guided. And just we had supply chain constraints hitting us this quarter. Omicron disrupted several of our key suppliers. They couldn't produce. They couldn't get us products. But net-net when you look at the fourth quarter relative to where we were third quarter, let's say as a proxy, volume and mix was up slightly. It was up about six-tenths. But then we had additional headwinds on commodities. We had some modernization costs that came through, specifically around our IT as well as connectivity as we're investing in those growth areas. And then we saw costs come through from inflation. We saw costs come through on transportation, on fuel, et cetera. So we're seeing some of those headwinds were hitting us in the fourth quarter. But demand was strong. If we could have met the demand and the production without the disruptions, you would have seen a stronger quarter. And so as we go into 2022, as we see those supply constraints ease, as we see the demand for our really strong product lineup, we see the top line growing. We see continued improvement in mix. We see continued improvement in price. And that's going to be much more of a tailwind versus some of the headwinds we're seeing [Technical Difficulty] Colin Langan : And just following up on the mix. Any color on how the Lightning will impact as it runs in obviously, pretty large battery there? Is that going to be dilutive as we think about the second half as that starts to ramp? John Lawler : No. I don't think that as we ramp up at the start with the launch this year that it's going to have a significant impact on what we see from a standpoint of our profits in North America. And then coming back I think one of the questions Colin you had asked that, I didn't touch upon was the fourth quarter or maybe it was Emmanuel earlier on the mix side is we did have lower Super Duty mix in the quarter and that was again driven by supply chain disruptions. There were vehicles that we weren't able to build and complete because of certain commodities that weren't coming through to get those vehicles down the line and done. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Johnson with Barclays. Brian Johnson : Yes, good afternoon. I want to talk a little bit about dealer pricing versus your pricing. The Detroit Press ran some articles in January on taking action in some of the more egregious markups on EV. Yet if I look at the broader lineup, I see that per J.D. Power your revenue per unit is up about 3-point \u2013 3,800, which clips to your $7.6 billion pricing you cited. Yet the transaction prices are up 5,600, meaning you're leaving about $1,850 of profit in the dealers' hands which would be about another $3.6 billion of profit. So just wondering kind of as you kind of go forward as the dealers, especially move to this simplified inventory model you're looking at how you're thinking about the balance between your invoice your revenue per vehicle and the actual transaction prices at the dealer level? Jim Farley : Thank you. I would say, the answer to your question for ICE and BEV would be slightly different. We have about 10% of our dealers last year in the supply-constrained environment that, we're charging above MSRP to our best of our knowledge. We have very good knowledge of who they are. And their future allocation of product will be directly impacted because of that policy. And we've seen really quick action by our team. On the BEV side, this is quite an important topic, because the margins that we want to build to in BEV are going to be heavily dependent on a different go-to-market and customer experience. I won't go into any more than that, but this is a quite important lesson for us of the franchise system, and the way we will manage going forward. But I'm very optimistic now that our team has the intelligence in the market that we put an allocation trigger in for those dealers who choose to price that way. But it's inefficiency no doubt about it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark Delaney : Yes. Thanks very much for taking the call. So maybe you could help us better understand the linearity of reaching the 600,000 annualized EV capacity target, and what kind of visibility you have into securing the necessary supply to do that both in terms of things like semiconductors as well as batteries? Jim Farley : Thank you. So we've been hard at work at this for quite some time actually. We knew we were oversubscribed pretty early in the process and the team has been at it. We have been working. Really, the primary lift for us is battery availability. So we've actually been securing extra batteries for quite some time now. We have some manning options for Mach-E. So we will move close to 100000 units this year on Mach-E. That will be our big move this year. Next year, our big move will be Lightning going to 150000 units. I won't get into battery chemistries and all the details, but I'm really excited about the progress we've made so far in securing batteries. On the F-150 Lightning, we actually had a physical capacity constraint of the facility. And so we took the decision already to again redesign the facility so that we can accommodate the 150,000 units. We have great capacity on F-150 for the nonelectric components. So this is just a matter of the Mach-E getting the labor in place and getting the batteries, and the F-150 getting the batteries out of Georgia and redesigning the facility so we can get the final assembly done. As far as chips are concerned these battery electric vehicles and the supply chain are a strategic advantage for our company. So we will protect in the constraint where we will protect our battery electric supply production. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : Thank you. Jim, it's really refreshing to hear you talk about the two different businesses and how you're managing them and running them and planning for them separately. I guess so to the -- and it's also good to hear you think you would have more to wring out of the ICE business. But I guess the question is, as CEO of Ford which is managing those two businesses like to the extent, you are able to wring more out of ICE, does that give you leeway to accelerate or increase your investment in the EV business? Like how do you think about combining the two businesses back together in terms of the investment spend? Jim Farley : Absolutely. Absolutely. The profitability of ICE is very important because it gives us optionality, not only of scaling BEV, but also vertically integrating BEV which is increasingly becoming important for a profit lever. So we definitely want to push our ICE business as fast as far as we can. We're going into this transition with the freshest ICE lineup, I can think of any of our competitors not just in the US, globally. But we think there's, as John said, a ton of other levers that we can pull to improve the margins of our ICE business. We see our ICE business increasingly in kind of specialty groupings of passion brands like, Bronco and Mustang. And our pickup truck customers, retail side using those for recreation and for everything they use them for. And so look at the success of Maverick we've had for example. So, we're really excited about this opportunity for BEV. And you bet you, it gives us all sorts of optionality as a company to really continue to invest in high growth business but also focus -- allow us to focus our cash and our investment in building the margin for the high growth business through things like vertical integration and new customer experiences, accelerating our physical experiences to the dealers on both businesses. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Itay Michaeli with Citi. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thanks. Good evening everybody. I was hoping to go back and get an update on Mach-E profitability. I think a couple of quarters ago you mentioned you were already positive EBIT. It seems like pricing has been really strong in the last few quarters. You talked about taking out maybe $1000 of cost going forward. And of course, you're cutting up volume. I was hoping maybe you could give an update on kind of where you see Mach-E profitability this year versus your original expectation that maybe even relative to ICE vehicles perhaps like the Edge. John Lawler : Yes. Thanks. It's John here. So, when we look at our Mach-E profitability as we said, we are profitable from a Mach-E standpoint. We're seeing great demand. We're seeing strong mix. So, we've seen the profits improve. Importantly what else we're seeing is opportunities to continue to reduce the cost and reduce the complexity. So we're very focused on improving those margins. But overall, as we said in the past, our fab margins are not yet quite where we like them to be especially relative to our more profitable ICE vehicles. And so, we have to continue to do work there primarily around scaling, reducing the complexity as we move forward. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing on Mach-E so far, especially with the strong demand and the mix but there's other work that we need to do as well to continue to further improve those margins. And our expectation is that we're fully competitive on our BEV margins as we move forward and that's what we need to work towards. Jim Farley : Just to complement John's input. I'm struck -- throughout my career I'm struck at how different the rhythm of this digital BEV business is versus ICE. We all grew up in a business where you kind of launched the vehicle and then you work on a minor change or a next model. I certainly grew up in that model. And what we're finding with ICE, thank goodness we're scaling now, because what we're finding in Mach-E is that actually most of the exciting work starts after job one. That's when the OTAs really make a customer impact. But on the cost side and the profit side, I guess we have learned so much about the lack of integration in our engineering operations as we compared our engineering on Mach-E to others that are best-in-class. And we are finding lots of profit opportunities as we get after that integration between engineering supply chain and manufacturing even within engineering. If I showed you our cooling system for Mach-E it has four motors probably needs to be two. It has 60 or 70 hoses probably needs to be one-third of that. And those are the opportunities we're going after. And we are not going to wait for next year. We're not going to wait for a minor change. We are going to reengineer that vehicle now and then use that expertise for Lightning, E-Transit and of course our all electric platforms. And I just -- I'm really excited about this opportunity. Being in the industry as long as I have, I haven't felt this chance to take out so much cost after job one both from the customers' use of the vehicle off the data as well as actually all these integration opportunities. And the other thing is the vehicles are much more simple than we thought. The F-150 has one cab, one box. And we -- for the same kind of ICE offering, it's like 40 configurations. So they're much simpler. And I'm really excited about -- I guess what I'm saying is we're at the very beginning of this journey. And it is -- it's already very exciting on the profit improvement as John said. And I haven't seen this kind of opportunity in the past in my career. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Anindya Das with Nomura. Your line is open. Okay. Our next question will come from the line of Jeoffrey Lambujon with Tudor Pickering. Jeoffrey Lambujon : Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to go back to the regional discussion as we think about the thoughts you shared on margins in North America that are embedded in the upper end of the full year 2022 EBIT guide. I wonder if you could just give us a sense for how you're thinking about the trajectory of margin improvement in Europe and IMG specifically. Just thinking about the semiconductor shortfall evolving over time the focus on Ford Pro and new product launches potentially helping to accelerate some margin recovery in Europe, and then the continued focus on Ranger and new products in IMG? John Lawler : In Europe, we expect profit improvement. We expect them to be meaningfully profitable in this year in 2022. And we're still committed and Europe is on track to deliver the 6% EBIT margin by 2023. They're continuing to move forward. They're seeing favorable pricing environment continue. They're accelerating into the BEV. The Mach-E is a very strong product for them. And again commercial vehicles, it's a strength of ours and we continue to see that grow next year and be a pillar for Europe, a strength for Europe. With IMG as you go into 2022, International Markets Group, we expect them to be down year-over-year but profitable. And that's going to be driven by two key things : the India transition and what we see there as well as the fact that our Ranger volumes are going to be down year-over-year as we launch the new Ranger. And so it's a transition year for us in the International Markets Group. So they'll be down year-over-year but profitable. And then from there with the new Ranger, we're really excited about that product and what we can leverage with that product as we move forward in our International Markets Group. Operator : Thank you. And with that, we will conclude today's Ford Motor Company Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, Andrea. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's first quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, our President and CEO; and John Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit; Hau Thai-Tang, Chief Industrial Platform Officer; and Doug Field, Chief EV and Digital Systems Officer, Ford Model e. Today's discussions include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussions also include forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on page 28. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is volume weighted. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Farley : Hello, everyone. Thank you, Lynn, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Yesterday, I was with Bill Ford and our incredible team at the Rouge factory, where my grandfather worked, to celebrate Job One for the F-150 Lightning. We were also proud as a team for delivering a truly breakthrough electric truck and delivering it on time as a launch. The excitement around the truck is like nothing I've ever seen in my career. In fact the power went out in the facility and we ran most of the presentation with F-150 Pro Power Onboard. While we have work ahead to fully scale production and fill an extraordinary order bank, both for our retail Lightning customers and Ford Pro, make no mistake, this is a very important moment for us at Ford. We're accelerating our significant transformation. We have the right plan called Ford+. We are putting in place the right organization. As you know on March 2, we announced our plan to form two distinct, but interdependent business units called Ford Model e and Ford Blue. Together with Ford Pro, these three automotive businesses allow us to clearly define and assign priorities, make the most of our existing strengths, but also build new strategic muscles and most importantly capabilities. Ford Model e is responsible for delivering clean sheet breakthrough EV designs, software advanced electric architectures, partial autonomy. And Ford Blue's mission is to deliver a more vibrant and profitable ICE business, a business that's going to serve in the short term as our profit and cash engine for the entire enterprise. So what have we learned since March 2? And what are we working on at Ford? In terms of Model e, first, it's very clear to us that battery capacity is the key unlock to our EV aspirations and propel our growth in the future. We're in good shape in the near term. In the medium and long term, securing raw materials, processing precursor and refinement and setting up battery production here in the US and around the world is a big work statement for us. Expect a lot of news from Ford in the future related to the vertical integration of our EV business. Second, we're getting after our talent gap in key areas, EV engineering, software and autonomous driving technology. We have a very good start already and we will continually be very aggressive on recruiting talent. Third, we're now deep into discussions with our dealer partners around the globe, but especially in North America on brand new standards that are required to launch a completely different customer experience that is leaner and better for our customers that we believe will not only be competitive, but superior to a solely direct model. We're drifting standards as we speak and plan to roll this out this year. Finally, we're crafting our EV future product pipeline and are focused on a small number of highly compelling, highly volume models in key segments where we already lead. I want to make this very clear. Some companies seem to be pursuing a strategy of trying to match model-wise volume with eight or nine top hats. That's not a winning plan in our view. We will focus on key volume nameplates, constrained capital, because we have it, but really to leverage scale and efficiency to reach and eventually exceed our 8% EBIT target for EVs. I want to be clear here that as we move forward, our EV designs will be progressive and they're going to be aimed at bringing new customers to Ford and Lincoln. They will not be electric versions of our existing lineup. Now in terms of Ford Blue, we will accelerate our restructuring and address our uncompetitive cost structure. We're going to attack complexity in areas such as powertrain. We can't wait. This work starts now. We will continue to invest in our ICE business, but in targeted ways to build our most popular and profitable vehicle lines, F-Series, Bronco, Super Duty and a few others. Another focus is quality. We made good progress on initial quality and launches. However, we continue to be hampered by recalls and customer satisfaction actions. This has to change. We must do more to aggressively address our engineering process and improve our robustness. Now, our Ford Pro business is on track. We see healthy growth in parts sales, mechanic repairs, growth in subscriptions for both charging and telematics and CV financing. Most importantly, we're making our customers' lives and businesses better. They're using data. They're improving their uptime and their bottom line. Supply chain constraints continue to impact our business, including some of our key profit pillars. That said, we're making progress on launching and scaling new products as you can see with Lighting. That said, our major focus now is accelerating a more fundamental change in our supply chain management to improve visibility through our entire value chain and secure supply, especially in places like semis and batteries. We're absolutely committed to unlocking value by improving our growth profile, our profitability and ability to generate sustainable cash flows from our automotive-related businesses. Our new targets include producing more than 2 million EVs in four short years by the end of 2026. That's about 70-plus CAGR. And we expect that by 2030 EVs will account for about 50% of our global sales. We have also reset our profit ambition. We are now targeting 10% company-adjusted EBIT margins by 2026. Now in terms of the first quarter, I would describe our performance as mixed. The appeal of our new products is really clear and customers demand is extremely strong, beyond the supply constraint of our industry. However, we are still grappling with persistent supply chain issues that prevent us from posting even stronger quarter. We're working to break constraints, whenever they exist to take full advantage of this incredibly hot product lineup. Both new EVs like the F-150 Lightning, but our iconic ICE vehicles as well. We remain committed to delivering our targets quarter-after-quarter, year-after-year earning your confidence along the way. And now, I'd like to turn it to John to take you through the quarter and our outlook this year. John Lawler : Thank you, Jim. In face of ongoing industry-wide supply chain disruption, and unremitting pandemic hurdles, we continued to execute against our Ford+ plan, including strengthening our product portfolio, investing in electrification, and other new and exciting opportunities fundamental to growth and value creation. In the first quarter, we generated $2.3 billion in adjusted EBIT, resulting in a margin of 6.7%. The year-over-year decline in total company profits was driven by higher commodity prices and lower volume and mix, partially offset by higher net pricing as we take top line pricing, while remaining disciplined with our incentive spend. Importantly, our operations outside of North America were profitable. Global wholesales were down 9%, consistent with our guidance and reflecting the continued supply chain issues. However, our run rate of vehicle production in North America improved significantly during the month of March, and we ended the quarter with an extremely healthy order bank. In fact, in the US alone, our order bank is primed to deliver about $17 billion in revenue. Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter. EBT was $900 million, reflecting strong lease residuals, and credit loss performance. Free cash flow was $600 million negative more than explained by unfavorable timing differences, and working capital deterioration due to the higher inventory levels, which included about 53,000 vehicles on wheels completed, but awaiting installation of components affected by the semiconductor supply shortage. We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity nearly $29 billion and $45 billion respectively. This includes our stake in Rivian, which was valued at $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter. Our strong balance sheet provides a solid foundation to continue investing in our Ford+ priorities. Now let me briefly touch on business unit performance for the quarter. North America delivered $1.6 billion of EBIT with a margin of 7.1%. Now this is down year-over-year as net pricing improvements were more than offset by higher commodity costs, higher warranty expense, unfavorable mix and lower volume. The volume and mix impact primarily reflects supply constraints unique to full-size pickups in large utilities. South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts delivering its third consecutive profitable quarter and its highest quarterly EBIT margin in over 10 years. The region continues to focus on scaling its business for growth, especially, pickup trucks and commercial vehicles. In Europe, our operations delivered an EBIT margin of 3% despite a 9% decline in volumes. The underlying trajectory of our business continues to improve. However, the adverse impact of the near-term supply chain disruption is dampening our overall results. Importantly, we continue to be the number one commercial vehicle brand in Europe. The transit has an extremely healthy order bank and we recently launched the all-electric E-Transit in Turkey. FORDLive continues to grow helping our commercial customers improve vehicle uptime and ultimately their bottom-line. And finally Mustang Mach-E is now being sold online in most major markets. Europe is building momentum towards a fully electric future expecting to reach 600,000 vehicles by the end of 2026. In China, we posted a moderate loss in the quarter. However, our cost performance improved on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Lincoln continues to be a bright spot and profit pillar for the region. Market share improved 20 basis points year-over-year and the all-new Zephyr is off to a fast start. In the first quarter China also continued to make progress towards our electrification strategy. We opened 10 more customer experience centers now 35 in total and made other investments to modernize our direct-to-consumer network. Our International Markets Group performed well in the first quarter continuing to be solidly profitable despite supply constraints and suspension of our joint venture operations in Russia. The upcoming launch of the next-generation Ranger remains on track. And in March, we unveiled the next-generation Ranger Raptor and Everest. And finally in Mobility, we continue to make steady progress towards scale commercialization of moving people and moving goods. In the first quarter, we divested our investments in both TransLoc and Spin further rationalizing our portfolio with a focus on autonomous development. And now I'll share with you our current thinking about the remainder of 2022. For the full year our guidance is unchanged. We expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT which is up 15% to 25% from 2021 with adjusted free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion. This reflects year-over-year growth in wholesales of 10% to 15% and assumes that semiconductor availability will improve in the second half including the constraints that adversely impacted our full-size pickups and large utilities in North America in Q1. We also assumed in our guidance that disruptions in the supply chain and local vehicle manufacturing operations resulting from the renewed COVID-related health concerns and lockdowns in China do not further deteriorate our supply chains. Now relative to adjusted EBIT. On a year-over-year basis, our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America and collective profitability outside of North America. We also expect Ford Credit EBT to be strong, but lower than 2021 and mobility and corporate other EBIT to be roughly flat. Other assumptions factored into our guidance include; first, we have a very strong order bank as Jim mentioned for our new iconic products such as Bronco, Bronco Sport, Maverick along with a robust EV lineup Mustang Mach-E, E-Transit, F-150 Lightning now in production as well; second, pent-up demand beyond our order bank, a continued strong pricing environment including the benefit of pricing actions taken in the first quarter and improved mix. The interplay role between volume and pricing will remain dynamic. And third, we expect commodity headwinds of about $4 billion, which we expect to offset by improvements in net pricing and mix. Fourth, we anticipate other inflationary pressures to continue impacting a broad range of costs. We are aggressively looking at all opportunities to offset this reality including aggressively ramping up our efforts on additional cost reductions. And fifth, at Ford Credit, we expect auction values to remain strong as supply constraints persist. However, as I mentioned we anticipate strong but lower EBT reflecting primarily the non-recurrence of reserve release, fewer return off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses. Our results in the quarter, our balance-of-year outlook and commitment to our medium-term targets demonstrate the power of our Ford+ plan as we continue to invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation. This includes devoting resources to customer facing technology, connectivity, our always on relationships with customers, and electrification. We are confident the long-term payback from these investments will be substantial. So that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to hear your questions and address what's on your mind. And so thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Rod Lache of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : Hi everybody. Thanks for taking my question. First, I wanted to ask you about inflation. Price versus cost is, obviously, a pretty big drag here and I assume that you would expect inflation to stick around for a while. I was hoping you might talk a little bit about how that's influencing your decision-making, your internal messaging. What is in your view going to be the interplay between price and volume as volume and inventory starts to normalize? Is there still pricing power after everything you've achieved over the past couple of years? And does this affect your margin targets? Jim Farley : Hi, Rod, thank you for your question. Obviously we're seeing on the commodity side steel, aluminum, copper, lithium, nickel. On the logistics side a lot of premium freight. We're seeing pressures on inflation from suppliers. So it's really across the board. I'll let John answer the pricing question, but I would say, we really have quite a bit of pricing we've recently put in the market. It's stuck. And in addition, we feel like we have a lot of cost upside as well in the company. I know that's not your question, but that's an opportunity. John? John Lawler : Yeah. So, hi, Rod. From a pricing standpoint, so far we have seen pricing just about offset the inflationary pressures that we've seen. And so, we've been aggressive with top line. We've been balanced with the incentives. We do expect the commodity inflation, as Jim said, to continue through the year. So the pricing that we've taken reflects that. And so I would say that, we've been aggressive so far starting last year from a pricing standpoint. I would also say that the dynamic between the volumes and the pricing is going to remain influx. And as we go through the rest of this year and volumes improve, we have assumed that in the second half you would see increased pressure on your incentives and that's assumed in our guidance. I would also say Rod that, right now, many of the dealers are transacting near or above MSRP across the industry. So that has to be a compression that's going to happen first on the pricing front. And we're watching that very closely. We've also taken actions where we can improve our pricing by work we've done with our dealers. So one of the things we did in the quarter is we adjusted our floor plan adjustment to the dealers. In the past we had paid them 1.5% of MSRP to cover the floor plan the carrying cost. And we've adjust that to about 75 days with the actual cost. So the actually cost of 75 day. So that's been a benefit that\u2019s flowing through our pricing as well. So, we see it as dynamic. We do agree that as volumes increase, it will be dynamic relative to incentives. We're not pollyannish about that. We've reflected what we think is appropriate in the second half relative to incentives to adjust for the volume that we see coming in, but we'll also be aggressive on pricing. If commodity -- if commodities keep going up, we'll be aggressive as we can. So I think it's going to be a dynamic play as we go through the rest of the year. I would say though that when we step back and we look at the pricing relative to 2020 model year -- what we've taken since 2020 model year, we'd have to increase incentives considerably to offset that pricing. On a run rate basis, they'd have to move from -- I think we're in single-digits -- today low-single-digits. They have to move up into like 16% -- 15%, 16% to offset that pricing. So -- and that's back at a time when we had extremely high inventories and we had a very push-through process and we're not going to go back to that. We're going to be very disciplined with our inventory. So... Jim Farley : Percent of revenue. John Lawler : Yeah, as a percent of revenue. And so, we're working costs. We're working all the angles. Rod Lache : Thanks for that. And any color on the outlook for Europe for the rest of this year just given all of the macro pressures there? It looks, you've been posting pretty solid results there recently. John Lawler : Yeah. We expect those results to continue. We were in Europe hampered by the supply chain reductions. But, it was nice to see that even though we were hit by that, Europe did post a better than expected quarter for us. So, we're continuing to do well in commercial vehicles. We launched the E-Transit, which has been very well received. Mustang Mach-E has been very well received as well. So, we do expect the business in Europe to continue to improve in the second half as the rate and flow of supply improves for them as well. Rod Lache : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from John Murphy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good evening, everybody. I just wanted to ask a question sort of on the growth side Jim. I mean the F-150 Lightning orders it sounds like they're mostly incremental buyers folks that haven't been Ford or F-150 buyers before. I'm just curious if you think that is just sort of a surge here at the launch of the truck or is this sort of 15% to 20% sort of incremental orders relative to the base F-150 something you think will stick around? I mean because obviously that's very powerful potentially to your earnings. And do you expect the profitability of this truck over time to have a variable margin that would be similar to the F-150? I think sort of being even a little bit more verbose do you expect the same kind of thing with the 250 350 which you'll launch in two or three years? Jim Farley : Well, I didn't know we announced that but thank you very much for your question. I'd like to maybe ask Doug to come in here and talk about the levers we have on the profit side. But so far it's very clear to us that the Lightning customers are incremental. And as you said it's early days. We capacitized in the end of the day the facility that we were in is about 80,000 units. We'll almost double that by the end of next year. And I would say at this point the customer profile is dramatically younger. It's in states like California and New York that we normally don't sell full-size trucks. We do have some \u2013 lots of orders in Texas. It's a higher education that we see. And what they're interested in is different about the truck. So I think it's very clearly so far incremental. Now when we get into volume production 150,000 units that may change. And we'll see that with the order as we order \u2013 open the order bank again for the next model year this summer. Doug, do you want to highlight the opportunities you see maybe on F-150 Lightning but more generically on our next product? Doug Field : Sure. To start with I'm really excited about what we're building off of in Ford strength. These are cost bases that I'm drooling over in terms of the future products. But when we talk about EV specifically, the first thing we have to do is really control the battery materials and the chemistry there the single largest build materials opportunity of course but the next is really obsessing over how we use those materials and chemistries. Energy efficiency is a religion and the team is really stepping up to this. Every single watt of consumption is now being tracked and optimized. And on the new programs changes in aerodynamics and drive unit optimization we're seeing dozens of miles of improvement in range. That's hundreds and even in some cases thousands of dollars of battery that we can take out. Finally I think really going after a true ground-up approach to how we build EVs. They're different than internal combustion vehicles. And you could take advantage of that and really change the number of \u2013 in our next F-Series EV factory we're going to have on the main line half the stations that we use today to build a Lightning. So I'm very optimistic with this journey that we have some really good ground to make up on margin. Jim Farley : John... John Murphy : Actually can I just ask one follow... Jim Farley : Go ahead. Go ahead John. John Murphy : No. Keep going Jim. Sorry I had a follow-up on... Jim Farley : I just want to say on the Super Duty obviously that's a quarter of profitability as a company globally. And when we look at the customer usage, we just don't feel at this point that an electric solution is going to be ideal for most of those customers. So our vehicles will be really focused on light duty and the lower end of Super Duty for sure, but not 250s 350s 450s. That's a whole different ball of wax. They require a lot of [indiscernible]. Heavy batteries that doesn't make sense. John Murphy : Got it. And I'm sorry, a follow-up on the 53,000 units that are in inventory on wheels. Is that what we're seeing in this 21% increase in inventory on the balance sheet from the fourth quarter to the first quarter? And presumably, the cost has not been accounted for at all here and we'll see those vehicles flush out to the system in the second or third quarter when the chips become available. I'm just trying to understand John Lawler, the economics and what profitability boost may be from these vehicles flowing out. Could you just kind of explain sort of how you're accounting for this and what the benefit might be in the second and third or fourth quarter when they actually are finished? John Lawler : Yes. So John, that's exactly right. That's what's hitting us from a cash standpoint. And the inventory increases is for the most part the vehicles on wheels at 53,000 units. We have a cost for those in our results, but we have no revenue for them. And as they build out and we complete them in this quarter and into the third quarter, we'll start to get results for that to the bottom line. And then we're primarily are more profitable vehicles and it's primarily F-Series and Explorer. So, there's definitely an opportunity there that will start to roll through the bottom line once we start shipping those out. And the reason why -- one of the reasons why we built those John, because the modifications we need to make, we're very confident, we can do that without compromising quality. But our production is fully subscribed. So we would have lost these units if we hadn't built them and set them aside until the chips are available. John Murphy : I'm sorry John, the costs are recognized in the first quarter results, but obviously the revenue is not? I'm just trying to understand this because, it sounds like it might have a big impact in sort of people's understanding of the cadence of earnings through the course of the year. John Lawler : No. The profits aren't recognized in the quarter, right? But the costs, we backed out like for labor et cetera that's been all backed out. That's an inventory. John Murphy : Okay. Got it. Okay. Thank you, very much. Operator : The next question comes from Colin Langan of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. As you mentioned, the EV battery costs have really dramatically increased. Has that changed your EV strategy at all? Do you think, you're going to need to maybe raise the pricing of the Lightning and the Mach-E? And what can you do about it or maybe switch to different chemistries, all out more hybrid? How can you address it if raw materials stay at these very high levels for that -- those battery materials? Jim Farley : Thank you for your question. Well, first of all, the demand for EVs right now is extremely robust at Ford. So, we have the opportunity we believe for pricing. We're not going to get into those details now. But Doug said something very important, Colin, I want to emphasize, which is battery chemistry. We believe very strongly at Ford. The chemistry we have really key part of our protection against commodity price increases, and frankly, the benefits to the customer. Doug, do you want to add anything? Doug Field : No. Ford, a number of years ago started Ion Park, which is a team of experts really focusing on chemistry. Lithium-ion phosphate, of course, we know from the industry is something that takes you away from the dependence on nickel. That will be a part of our battery, and we're also looking chemistries that give us an opportunity to be less dependent on the specific materials that everyone seems to be fighting over in the market. Jim Farley : So in the short-term, we\u2026 Colin Langan : Can you which two tells us please? Jim Farley : Go ahead with your question. Sorry, Colin. Colin Langan : Yes. I was just going to say you mentioned you're able to do LFP or that's in the plan. I mean, how quickly can you switch because nickel is spiked now? I mean, I'm just kind of wondering how flexible and how quick you could adapt to that $2 million target by 2025? Jim Farley : Yes. We've been working on LFP for quite some time, so let's just leave it at that. What I mean by that is, engineering LFP solutions in our first generation of products something that we see is a big opportunity and to move quickly. Colin Langan : Got it. And just second question, you mentioned in your comments about warranty costs and that was going to be a big driver of margins. It does look like it was up year-over-year. Is that just sort of a temporary blip in the quarter, or is there a structural issue that we're going to see some higher elevated warranty through the rest of the year? Hello. John Lawler : Yes. Colin, thanks for the question. When we had our Capital Markets Day event, we signaled that we were targeting $1 billion to $2 billion of warranty opportunity by the mid-decade. In 2021, we delivered $1.4 billion of that. So, roughly 70% of that total opportunity. When you look at Q1 of this year, we had a deterioration. Some of that was just a non-repeat of items that we recognized in 2021 that didn't flow through. This is still a huge opportunity for us. It's the number one priority for us as -- for my team, as a skill team is really focusing on improving quality warranty as well as recall performance not only because of the drag on the business, but more importantly, because of the impact on our customers. So this is something that we're really focused on. And as Jim and others highlighted earlier, it's a huge opportunity for us to eliminate waste within the company and offset some of those commodity and headwind costs that we discussed earlier. Colin Langan : Got it. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : The next question comes from Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Jonas : Hey, everybody. Is Lisa Drake on the call? Jim Farley : No. No. But Doug is here. Okay. I'll pass it on to her. Adam Jonas : We've got great people on the call. We're good. First, I noted the Lilac Solutions partnership that's a really, really good call here and a lot of really great things. So we had great job there. If you could imagine that the entire metal and mining industry were listening to this call right now and they really should be. What would your message right now, Jim? Jim Farley : The message would be we need to work together and find good deals. That's what the message would be that we know what we're looking for. We're focused on lithium and nickel those two. We want to do smart deals that work for them and for us. And number two we want to move some of the processing in North America. And we're willing to invest capital to move the processing precursor work from overseas to North America for a variety of reasons. Doug, would you edit that list? Doug Field : No. I think that's the right list. Adam Jonas : The right list. And just my follow-up Ford Credit side. You guys are massive extraordinarily well-managed portfolio in a market that at least historically can react to oil shocks and economic pressures of course over time. And we're seeing some pretty crazy changes in the market. Just for the record, any sign of pressure in the portfolio in terms of delinquencies, loan losses basically the strength in the consumer that you so very credibly and powerfully can comment on as an economic indicator for this audience? Thanks. Marion Harris : Hi, Adam it's Marion Harris here. The short answer is, no. We're seeing strength in delinquencies. They're up marginally versus last year but still well below anything we've seen. And a lot of that's on the back of strong used car values which we expect to remain strong for some period of time. And you're even getting into the gas price piece of this. One of the things we've been looking at is whether or not there is a change in auction values by segment. And we're not seeing any differences in prices or price movements for large SUVs versus smaller sedans. So the trends continue and we still feel very good about the Credit business. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Marion. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Levy of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dan Levy : Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. First question is just on the guidance. So we know you're maintaining the guide of $12.5 billion, but you've also said you're guiding to now $2 billion to $2.5 billion of higher raw mat. Europe is a choppier environment. China is a choppier environment. And then there is also other inflationary pressures that aren't in that raw mat guide. So I just want to understand what is the full set of offset to that. You've talked about price but maybe you could just talk how that compares to maybe other cost offsets that will allow you to maintain your guide despite those incremental headwinds. John Lawler : Yes. Dan, thanks. So price is the main offset there for the full year pricing offsetting the inflationary pressures that we're seeing. We are being very aggressive in ramping up additional cost efforts because we know that this is not going to -- we don't believe that the pressure on cost due to inflationary pressures is going to ease anytime soon. So we need to find more efficiencies. We need to improve productivity. And Jim and the team and we are working very hard on that. It's a priority for us. So the other thing that we have is in the second half of the year we do have volumes improving based on the better availability of someway as we see that through the system. So that's another big driver for us in the year. And we'll see that in the second half over the first half as that comes online. So Hau, do you want to talk a little bit about how you're seeing that and what we've been doing to manage that? Hau Thai-Tang: Yeah. Thanks John. So as John mentioned in his remarks in March, we had the highest production run rate that, we've seen frankly in the last couple of quarters. That's the result of a lot of hard work, with all of our suppliers at every level of the value chain to break constraints, ensure that we're getting our fair allocation, as well as expediting freight to pull ahead some of the available supply. In parallel, the design actions that we've taken over the past year to design our way out of some of these constraints are coming online. And if you guys reflect on last year many of our wafer and chip suppliers started implementing capacity actions, and those are also coming on in the back end of the year. So that's what's giving us the increased confidence around the guidance that John highlighted. John Lawler : And the other thing I would add is that, the demand, as Jim said earlier is very strong for our new products and that's encouraging for us. We just can't build enough of them and we see that demand continuing. Q - Dan Levy And the mix assumption within this? John Lawler : The mix assumption is that, we'll revert back to a normal run rate mix that we would expect to see. We were disproportionately hit in the first quarter by a commodity module and Hau can talk more about that. He's better to talk about it than I \u2013 than me than I can. And his \u2013 the team has worked through that. So we believe we have that resolved. So we should see a more normal run rate of our mix as we move forward. Jim Farley : Hau, do you want to comment on that specific comment because I \u2013 commodity, because I think it is really material. Hau Thai-Tang: Yeah. So we had a wiper module that was deployed on our most profitable vehicle lines as John mentioned our large pickup trucks and utilities in North America. So we had limited ability to do any mix management and flex, with other lower-profit vehicle lines. That issue has been resolved. We've designed our way out of it. And again, we have a line of sight to not only support the back half of the year production, but also address some of vehicle on wheels with that commodity. Dan Levy : Great. And then my second question is just as we think about the costs that are coming online, I think you've discussed in the past that really in your re-org that Blue is going to be what fund Model E. So in a good market, it's very easy to see how incremental profits from the core combustion business are funding your EV growth. But now that we have more costs that are coming into the system maybe you can give us a sense how you're looking at your growth investments. EV, I assume you're going to invest in that regardless of what the underlying market environment is, but maybe you can give us a sense of are there other growth investments that are maybe more discretionary that you can \u2013 if you need to pull back on or delay. How do you think about other growth investments? Jim Farley : Our opportunity is really around our cost in our Blue business. That's how we look at it. In terms of investing, we need to invest in a fully networked advanced electric architecture. We need to advance \u2013 we need to invest in Level 2 and Level 3 autonomy. We need to invest in a new portfolio and changing our industrial system over to these electric digital products. We need to invest in our OS software that supports all of that. And we need -- we believe very strongly we need to invest in Level 4 autonomy.  So at this point in time, I don't personally see any discretionary -- our Ford+ plan is so specific about where to invest. That -- at this point in time, our real work that we need to do is to get after these inefficiencies and improve the productivity of our base business. That's really where we're focused. And of course, it's implied that as a management team we need to make these investments as efficiently as we can for all this new technology and growth. I hope that makes sense to you. Dan Levy : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes. And good afternoon and thank you very much for taking the question. The first is on the new structure Jim, about two months now since Ford announced the split into the different segments including Ford Blue and Model e. I'm hoping to better understand how employee reception has been. And for Doug Field perhaps specifically maybe you can talk about what is meant for your ability to get the right engineering talent. And are there any anecdotes or data points you can share? Jim Farley : I think reception has been terrific. We worked hard on this and we were prepared. We know -- we knew kind of what we needed to communicate to the employees and why this is necessary and why it makes sense. So, I think the reception has been good. The proof in the pudding is going to be how this executes. And we're -- that's why I wanted to give an update actually in my comments on what we've done since March 2 and a lot has changed. Doug over to you. Doug Field : Thanks. Yes. We did think a lot about this and I had a great partner in Hau to figure out how we were going to take best advantage of Ford's deep capabilities that I have not access to in my prior roles. So, the organization is set up, where Ford Model e can't and doesn't build cars by themselves. We rely on an industrial platform that does great [Technical Difficulty] and Ford Model e contribute software [Technical Difficulty] systems back to Ford Blue. So, there's an interdependency that really helps the team work, I think.  As far as attracting talent, I've been really delighted and surprised by the kind of talent that we can attract from tech. I think there's a certain amount of fatigue in the tech world and a lot of mature products out there. The opportunity to work on high technology, but do it in a brand that is so iconic in the United States and something that is so -- such a rich product like a vehicle is really attracting some great people.  Finally, I think from a talent perspective, Ford Model e is also helping us really dig into the internal team and find great people who can step up take on different kinds of roles, be put in positions of authority and really help drive us forward. There are great people here. Mark Delaney : That's really helpful. My second question was on the volume outlook for 10% to 15% wholesale growth which the company has maintained even though we've had unfortunately the war and also the new COVID restrictions pop up in China. I'm hoping to better understand how Ford is still managing to that 10% to 15% growth? And to what extent is the company taking incremental actions to find different suppliers that perhaps you hadn't been expecting to have to do? And is it more that you're doing those sorts of things to still do 10% to 15% growth, or is it perhaps more about Ford's suppliers not being overly impacted by these recent events? Thank you. Jim Farley : Thank you. It really comes down to the commodities -- semiconductor-related commodities that have been hamstringing us. We, obviously, are spending a lot of money on premium freight and other things to work around COVID escalations in China. But really the second half of the year's production increase relates to those. So Hau I don't know if you want to add anything specifically. Hau Thai-Tang: Yeah. Mark so the two hotspots that you highlighted Ukraine, Russia I think we've done a really good job of managing that and minimizing any large significant production risk mostly because of our global sourcing patterns and we were able to get parts from other areas of the world. In terms of China, we're scaling the Shanghai area. We have about 50 Tier 1 suppliers there. Our focus is on our profit pillar vehicles, and as Jim mentioned really leveraging expedited freight. We've secured fast maritime shipment as well as airlift capacity to protect our suppliers. And then they're just starting to have a white list process to allow suppliers to resume production. So we're working with our teams on the ground in China to help those suppliers get partially operational. So those actions we think will really help us. And as Jim mentioned what's going to be gating us is semiconductors. A lot of these constraints are nested within that. So it comes down to the work that we're doing on the semiconductor supply. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan Brinkman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. As we near the -- I think 180-day lockup expiry on your investment in Rivian, how are you thinking about the options available to you in terms of this investment going forward? Are you maybe more inclined to retain some or all of the stake given the recent decline in Rivian shares? And if you were to monetize it, how are you thinking about the use of any potential proceeds? Could you maybe use them to accelerate your own electrification efforts, or are you maybe already devoting all the resources necessary there? And so would perhaps look to prioritize other opportunities? I don't know maybe shareholder friendly actions. How are you thinking about these options? Jim Farley : Yeah. Unfortunately at this point, we're not going to comment on Rivian. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. Let me try one on Argo then. I recall you saying on an earlier call that your supportive of Argo AI's potential tapping of public equity. Is there any update you can provide there in terms of where Argo may be with that process, or just what is the latest you're thinking about in terms of their overall strategy and trajectory what has been maybe the early results of some of your trials of robo taxis on the Lyft network or in various cities beyond Miami? Jim Farley : Thank you. Well, first of all Argo, and Ryan continue to make great progress technically on the SDS for Level 4 autonomy. We're very happy with the technical progress. Number two, we really see maybe different than others Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 as two distinct products. Yes, Argo could help us with our semi-autonomous capability, but we feel like that would be a big distraction for them, which we do not want them distracted at all. And number three it's taking time. And this is expensive stuff. And so from our standpoint getting access to the capital markets is very critical to give us the flexibility to continue to fund this for many years to come. One thing I would say is we're very focused on partners that would be aligned strategically with Argo, use cases that would be very material in the deployment of Argo's technology. And we're getting more and more interested as a company maybe a bit of a strategic shift on goods movement. It's aligned with our commercial vehicle business and our customers feel they're getting more and more interested in middle mile specifically. I think that's a material update for Argo and hopefully that helps you. Ryan Brinkman\\: Yes, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joseph Spak : Thanks so much. A couple of questions on cash. I noticed CapEx is now $7 billion was -- I think it was $7 billion to $8 billion. Free cash flow the same. EBIT still the same. So, is the delta to maintain the free cash flow working capital? And then while we're on cash, it looks like redesign cash is now $1 billion lower this year versus prior. And I think given the total amount you expect to spend on that is lower now. So, can you just talk about what's going on there? John Lawler : Sure. On the redesign, there's efficiencies that we're seeing as we work through the redesign across each of the markets that we've restructured. And so you're starting to see that show up. There's also some timing differences in there as well where the work we're doing is let's say taking a bit longer to get to a solution or a final position with some of the counterparties we're working with. And we also announced the fact that we will be selling our [indiscernible] facility to AutoZone and that's going to allow to bring cash into that restructuring that we have there as well for global redesign. So, that's the short of it from that standpoint. The other point I think the question was around -- remind me what it was? Joseph Spak : The lower CapEx versus prior. John Lawler : Yes. Right. So, the lower CapEx-- Joseph Spak : Lower CapEx versus prior-- John Lawler : Yes. So, the lower CapEx that reflects no change in our intended investment in electrification or our fully networked architecture et cetera. It's just timing differences in this year relative to what we saw at the beginning of the year. So, you can still expect us to continually invest. We have the capital to do that. The balance sheet's strong. So, it doesn't reflect anything on where we see the business heading. It's just timing differences for the most part. Joseph Spak : Got it. And then just the follow-up the free cash flow remains the same is a little bit more of a working capital drag then? John Lawler : Yes, it's more of working capital. Yes. Absolutely. Joseph Spak : Okay. And then I think you sort of made it quite clear that the primary driver here of covering some of the higher cost is more advantageous pricing. Can you just parse some of the Ford Credit commentary a little bit? Because I think before you said it was going to be about $1.5 billion lower. And now there's some -- its strong but lower, so some of that also coming from -- some of that makeup, if you will, also coming from Ford Credit? Marion Harris : Yes. Joe, its Marion. Let me -- I'll just cover the guidance piece on Ford Credit. We said that the profits will be strong but lower. And that's reflected in the fact that we had large -- larger reserve releases in 2021 than we would expect in 2022. In addition to that, we had a lot more supplemental depreciation releases in 2021 than we would in 2022 related to the lease portfolio. Joseph Spak : Did your expectations changed versus what you communicated three months ago there, or this year? Marion Harris : No, no. No. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner of Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much. So John, last quarter you provided a very helpful walk towards the 2022 adjusted EBIT with some of the largest puts and takes. And so, I was hoping you could maybe update some of the buckets here. So, obviously, commodities was expected to be $1.5 billion to $2 billion drag. Now it's $4 billion. What is now the market factors versus the $6 billion from last time? Ford Credit was going to be $1.5 billion balance drag. I seem to understand from the last question that this hasn't changed. Any other changes besides market factors? And can you just quantify that? John Lawler : Yes. So I think what you see there is exactly that. There's no change to Ford Credit. We are seeing higher inflationary pressures. We are seeing higher top line pricing that's coming through, but we're also working on cost offsets as well. So I think it largely remains what we had talked about last time. We're just seeing higher inflationary pressures and higher pricing flow through. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. So versus the $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion in the volume mix price benefit from last time, we could basically add $2 billion to $2.5 billion to that, which was the pricing offset -- the cost offset? John Lawler : No. I don't think that it's as high as $2.5 billion, Emmanuel. It's -- there's growth in there, but it's not as high as that. I think that when you look at the walk relative to what we had provided last time, most of the inflationary pressures that we're seeing are being offset by a combination of additional cost reductions, pricing and mix that's flowing through, but it's not as large as that as what you had just indicated. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. On the cost piece of it, the -- are you dialing back or sort of like prioritizing some of the modernization investments, or is that largely left as is for this year? Jim Farley : No. I mean, our -- absolutely not. I try to make that -- I'll say it twice. We are really excited about our growth opportunity in EVs. We have electric architectures to invest in, shop for OS, we have partial autonomy to invest in, full autonomy to invest in. That's all part of our Ford+ plan. It's essential to our move to always on. We obviously have lots of investments in building out our service portfolio for Ford Pro. We're not holding back on any of that. The cost drivers that we see are things like obviously manufacturing, as we simplify our ICE lineup. And as Doug said, really completely redesign our manufacturing process for EV. We have opportunities in sales and -- marketing and sales opportunity in engineering, as we simplify our lineup and of course warranty and other areas. So I think we're \u2013 we know exactly what we need to do. Emmanuel Rosner : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Itay Michaeli of Citi. Please go ahead. Itay Michaeli : Hi, great. Thanks. Good evening, everybody. Just two quick ones for me and thanks for squeezing me in. First, you did talk about the cadence of earnings before but just hoping we can revisit it in terms of kind of how to think about the adjusted EBIT for the rest of the year and whether there is any bias at this point towards the low end or high end of your full year guidance range. And second more housekeeping question is whether you can provide what you anticipate the Ford Motor Credit dividends to be back up to the parent? Jim Farley : Yes. I mean we're not going to parse out the guidance. It's 11.5 to 12.5. It's a dynamic environment. We're working to offset all the headwinds and maintain the guidance. But as far as passing out where we sit within the guidance of 11.5 to 12.5. John Lawler : And then on the dividends the dividends are a function of overall profits and balance sheet size and leverage. And in this case you heard the guidance on profits and into the balance sheet. We don't expect much growth this year just given where we are in the vehicle constraints. So the majority of profits \u2013 we don't have a specific number. Jim Farley : And I'll just make it really clear on the overall company's automotive performance financial performance. The second half is very critical for us. It's just a very critical time for the company. We have the opportunity to build in volumes we haven't for a while. And we have a lot of great fresh products, a lot of costs coming in the business but second half is really critical for the company. Itay Michaeli : That\u2019s all very helpful.

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lynn Tyson : Thanks, Chad. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Jim Farley, our President and CEO; and John Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit.  Today's discussions include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck, along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content, at shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussions also include forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 22. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is volume weighted. Looking at our IR calendar, we have 2 upcoming engagements. Tomorrow, BNP Paribas will host a fireside chat with John Lawler and Kumar Galhotra, President of Ford Blue; and on August 10, at their Auto Conference in New York, JPMorgan will host a fireside chat with Ted Cannis, CEO of Ford Pro.  Now I'll turn the call over to Jim Farley. James Farley : Thanks, Lynn. Hello, everyone. The Ford team delivered a very solid second quarter in a challenging environment where we saw supply chain disruptions, a lot of new economic headwinds and uncertainty as a whole. Importantly, we achieved these results as we advance the Ford+ plan, which is the biggest opportunity to create value at Ford since we scaled the Model T. And at the core of Ford+ are 3 fundamental promises to our customers : distinctive and breakthrough products and experiences; and always on relationship with Ford every day, every hour, every minute; and ever-improving post-purchase user experiences powered by software.  Today, I'll give you an update on Ford+ and the early results of our decisions to reorganize the company into 3 distinct segments Model E, Ford Blue and Ford Pro.  Now let me start with the progress we're making to lead the electric vehicle and digital revolution. What's lost in the industry's arm race of claims regarding capital invested, the number of top hats we all have, the promises of future leadership is one fundamental question : who is and will be the best positioned to design truly distinctive and appealing products that people actually love? That's the question.  Now we've been overwhelmed with the demand for our first-generation EVs, the Mustang Mach-E, the Lightning and the E-Transit. These products are in the market now, and we have strong multiyear order banks. We're selling them as fast as we can make them.  And you can't say that about many of the EVs coming to market now. We believe that these great new products will enable us to grab an outsized share of the rapidly growing EV market, combined with our healthy and vibrant shares of our ICE and growing hybrid markets.  This month, we expect to produce 14,000 EVs globally. That's significantly higher than just a few months ago, and we have a clear path to reach a run rate of 60,000 EVs by the end of next year. And that will lead to a foundation to 2 million by late 2026. In fact, our anticipated growth rate in EVs through 2026 is more than twice what we expect for the global EV industry in total. Now securing the raw materials to produce batteries at scale is critical to our plan. It's estimated that at best, 50% of all raw materials required to meet the combined announced targets for all EV OEMs is actually available, 50%. And this is why speed to securing supply is so critical and strategic, so is diversifying our battery chemistries to increase our flexibility, supply and profit and to support different customer use cases.  Last week, we announced a series of MOUs and agreements to fulfill our ambition -- ambitious needs that I covered, and we are working to complete definitive agreements where necessary. Our Model E team moved quickly to capture these opportunities. To summarize, we've added battery chemistries and secure contracts, delivering 60-gigawatt hours of annual battery capacity, which will help us support fully the 600,000 units of that 2023 run rate of capacity. We now have lithium-ion phosphate, or LFP, battery packs coming for the Mach-E sold in North America next year and for Lightning in early 2024, creating more capacity for these high-demand products. We secured 70% of the battery capacity needed to support 2 million units by the end of 2026, and we struck a new deal with CATL on strategic cooperation for global battery supplies as well as deals for direct sourcing of critical battery raw materials in the U.S., Australia, Indonesia and more locations. And we have a plan to localize 40-gigawatt hours per year LFP capacity in North America by 2026. These deals are a strong start as we fortify our EV supply chain that's aligned with our sustainability and human rights principles. Now let's talk about the progress we're making in building out an always on relationship with customers and that ever-improving user experience enabled by software after the customer buys a vehicle. Now along with product execution, these are really the relevant sustainable advantages we see to create, in today's hypercompetitive market, a difference where the real competition is not legacy OEMs, but pure-play EV companies, including emerging Chinese players.  For example, more than 55,000 Ford customers have already driven nearly 10 million miles with BlueCruise, our hands-free L2 system. That's just one year after the capacity was launched, and we started OTA-ing this to our vehicles. We're using the data we get through BlueCruise to continue to improve the customer experience. And as it happens, you can imagine a significant ADAS revenue and profit stream being created by giving customers the ability to work, watch a film or even take a nap during a long trip in their Ford. While the financial benefits of ADAS are clear, as is our Ford Pro services stack, they're relatively small now, but we're rapidly increasing the number of digital vehicles on the road as well as attach rates of the enabling services. And over time, much of the SaaS revenue will be deferred on our balance sheet, providing an annuity-like revenue stream that is highly accretive, something this company and this industry has never seen.  Now before I turn to Ford Blue, let me talk briefly about our connected EV dealer model in the U.S. Changes in the market have compelled Ford and our dealers to revisit how customers shop, buy and own, and how they will do this going forward. We're moving fast as the transition to these digital EV platforms allows us to help our dealers provide better customer ownership experience post purchase, and in turn, enables them to expand the revenue and profit pools, expanding and improving their returns. We're working with our dealers to create a retail model better than what's offered by any traditional OEM and better than the startups who are now scrambling to develop sales and service networks to support customers in an attempt to sustain and grow share in UIL.  In the U.S. alone, if we can help our dealers increase service loyalty by just 20 points, that's $2.4 billion incremental revenue for them every year. Now since March, we've conducted more than 30 workshops in the U.S. and Canada, reaching hundreds of our dealers. I have personally been involved in many of these meetings. What is clear to me but not yet visible to the market is that our dealers are embracing this change. They know the competitive threat is real, and they want Ford and their dealership to lead and win. And we have more to share as this develops. Now turning to Ford Blue. The team is motivated by this sharpening focus on our ICE and hybrid products. We've added new talent and leadership to drive performance and focus in our trucks, our great family lineup and our enthusiast vehicles we're so proud of. We've revealed new vehicles like the Bronco Raptor, the Bronco Everglades, the F-150 Raptor R, which my kids think sounds great. In the third quarter, we'll unveil an all new seventh generation Mustang at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It is a stunning car, and I'm so excited to share it with the world. And also this fall, we'll be introducing an all-new Super Duty pickup, the workhorse at Ford, and it sets a standard in our industry.  There's much more to come. Our design center is filled with new products and derivatives that will further strengthen our hit vehicles in the ICE and hybrid franchises like F-150 and Bronco and Maverick, the brand-new global Ranger that\u2019s launching in Thailand and our new Everest. In short, our hottest and freshest lineup in recent history is getting even better. Now in commercial vehicle market, Ford Pro, our industry-leading global business, is leading the change into an electric software-driven world. Other OEMs are talking about large numbers of future electric orders. We're actually taking orders for manufacturing and selling commercial vehicles now.  Through the second quarter, we've sold more than 3,000 E-Transit in the U.S. That's a market share of 95% in the full-sized electric van market, 95%. In fact, our next 2 competitors combined sold just 159 vehicles.  Beyond the vehicles, we're also rolling out our Ford Pro charging commercial solutions and the very exciting and fast-growing e-telematics software solutions. And boy, are they paying off.  And in Europe, where we continue to be the leading commercial vehicle brand, we're already received 8,000 orders for our 2-tonne E-Transit, and our new one-tonne E-Transit custom goes on sale next year.  Now our Ford Pro software business is growing quickly. Telematics subscriptions globally have grown over 40% sequentially for the last two quarters.  Turning to quality. We made solid progress in initial quality, as you've seen in the recent J.D. Power's IQS study, and our launches have improved. However, we continue to be hampered by recalls and customer satisfaction actions. Yes, this affects our cost, but more importantly, it falls short on our most fundamental commitment to our customers. Quality is our #1 priority. In fact, we recently brought on Josh Halliburton from J.D. Powers to head quality. Now the team is focused on 3 critical areas : prevention, detection and remediation. We've instituted more robust engineering sign-off processes for the vehicles that are in the product development factory as we speak. We're driving much more frequent alignment with our supply base on quality. And when identified issues, we take actions quickly to resolve them, to protect our customer's experience, including by making much more frequent use of over their updates. And boy, has that work for us. We have more work to do in this space, and we will keep you updated. Overall, we're pleased with the progress this year, but we are not nearly satisfied. We remain clear-eyed and determined to move with speed and determination on a Ford+ transformation. The underlying strength of our business supports our 2022 adjusted EBIT guidance range of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion, unchanged from April.  Before I turn it over to John, I want to end with this. There's context that's critical to how we think about implementing our Ford+ plan. Traditionally, the auto industry has cut costs, often indiscriminately. As an effect, of course, from lower auto demands through economic softness and shift for customer preferences.  What we're undertaking forward is totally different than that. We're reshaping virtually every aspect of the way we've done business for a century. And we're doing that for a new industry based on new technology, new skills and new promise for customer value. And yet, cost reduction will happen in our ICE business because that's primarily what is made up of Ford today. But we're modernizing to take out unnecessary costs, redesigning work and strategically investing across all of our auto businesses, ICE and hybrid, then EVs and then Ford Pro, while at the same time, transforming every function that supports them.  Sweeping strategic change generates interest and speculation in the media, which we understand. However, we're going to comment on Ford+ actions we're taking and how they're going to strengthen our company on our own schedule. John? John Lawler : Thanks, Jim. During the quarter, on an adjusted basis, we delivered EBIT of $3.7 billion, an EBIT margin of 9.3% and free cash flow of $3.6 billion. Our cash conversion in the quarter was very strong and lifting our first half to 50%, with the target range of 50% to 60% that we set out at Capital Markets Day.  We ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity of $29 billion and $45 billion, respectively. And now these numbers include our stake in Rivian, which was valued at $2 billion at the end of the quarter. In Q2, we also successfully renewed our $17.2 billion sustainability-linked global credit facilities, which include a new $1.75 billion 364-day revolver, which provides for additional working capital flexibility. Our strong balance sheet is a solid foundation for continuing to invest in our Ford+ priorities.  Our results this quarter reflect the improved earnings and cash flow potential of our business, along with leverage created from disciplined capital allocation and a much more focused business model, including our industrial footprint. The tough choices we made during the global redesign to de-risk our business and exit unprofitable markets and products is paying off.  From 2018 to 2021, our markets outside North America consumed nearly $9 billion of free cash flow. This year, these markets are collectively expected to be free cash flow positive. We are confident in the underlying strength of our business and our ability to fund all the calls of capital -- all the calls that we have on capital, especially those fundamental to growth and value creation. We can achieve this while maintaining the financial flexibility to navigate external uncertainties. And as a result, we're increasing our regular quarterly dividend to $0.15 a share beginning this quarter. This returns us to the prepandemic dividend levels.  Now let me touch on the performance of our business units. North America delivered $3.3 billion of EBIT and a margin of 11.3%. Both of those measures were up year-over-year as an 89% increase in wholesales and strong net pricing and mix more than offset higher commodity costs and inflationary pressures.  South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering its fourth consecutive profitable quarter. In Europe, we posted a modest profit as a large increase in wholesales helped us reach just above breakeven EBIT. The underlying trajectory of the region continues to improve. However, the adverse effects of the near-term supply chain disruption are dampening its overall results. In China, we posted a loss as the local economy and auto industry were significantly disrupted by pandemic-related restrictions and lockdowns. Now Lincoln continues to be a profit pillar for the region, gaining share in the quarter, along with commercial vehicles.  Our International Markets Group continues to be sustainably profitable as a result of its restructuring efforts. In mobility, we are progressing our in-market pilots for moving goods and moving people and remain committed to autonomous driving. And finally, Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter, with EBT of $900 million reflecting strong lease residuals and credit loss performance.  Now let me share with you our current thinking for the remainder of 2022. For the full year, our guidance is unchanged. We expect to earn between $11.5 billion and $12.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, which is up 15% to 25% from 2021. This reflects 10% to 15% year-over-year growth in wholesales and assumes that semiconductor availability continues to improve. We're projecting to generate adjusted free cash flow of $5.5 billion to $6.5 billion, with a significant portion of that coming from automotive operations.  Relative to adjusted EBIT on a year-over-year basis, our range assumes significantly higher profits in North America, collective profitability in the rest of the world, strong but lower Ford Credit EBT. They'll be in the $3 billion range, and modest improvements in Mobility and Corporate Other.  Other key assumptions include strong order banks and pent-up demand for our new and iconic products, continued strength in pricing, which includes the benefits of pricing actions taken during the year, commodity headwinds of about $4 billion, which we expect to offset with improvements in net pricing and mix, a continuation of other broad-based inflationary pressures, and we now expect the full effect to be about $3 billion, which is up $1 billion from our estimate last quarter. And of course, we're aggressively working on offsets to these increases. And finally, at Ford Credit, auction values will remain strong but decline in the second half as the supply of new vehicles improve. EBT will be strong but lower, reflecting primarily lower credit loss reserve release, fewer return off-lease vehicles and more normalized credit losses.  Our results in the quarter, full year outlook and commitment to medium-term targets together demonstrate the power of Ford+ as we invest aggressively to drive growth and value creation.  But before we turn it to Q&A, let me provide a quick update on our new financial reporting. As we shared in March, starting in the first quarter of 2023, we will have 3 new business segments : Ford Model E, Ford Blue and Ford Pro, and will no longer report a combined automotive segment. With Ford Next, which is formerly Mobility and Ford Credit, this will bring our total reportable operating segments to 5. Now this change will not be a simple pro forma exercise. It's much more fundamental. These are true segments with both operating and financial accountability, giving you added transparency on our business.  So to help you prepare for this change, we plan to hold a teach-in early next year prior to releasing our 2022 results. We will use our revised 2021 results as a template to reflect the new segments. As part of the teach-in, we also plan to cover business rationale, mechanics of the new reporting structure and how our earnings disclosure and our SEC filings will change. When we report our fourth quarter and our full year results for 2022, they will be based on our existing reportable segments, and we are targeting to also share at the same time results that are revised to reflect the new segments.  And so if you have any questions about this, please don't hesitate to reach out to Lynn and the rest of the IR team.  So that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. Thank you. Operator, please open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from John Murphy from Bank of America. John Murphy : I wanted to ask a somewhat mundane question first on the outlook and then get into some pricing secondarily. But first, John, when you look at it, the seasonality of Ford's earnings traditionally is higher in the first half, lower in the second half. There's timing of cost and volume that usually drive that. Why do you think it's going to be different this year? And I guess maybe one of the big things that might be developing as we get later this year into early next year is that raw mats seem like they may be easing and fading, but the price/mix opportunities seems like it will be pretty strong. So that might help late this year and early next year. But just curious if you can comment if there's some of that change in a seasonal pattern so we can be comfortable with our estimates in the second half or your outlook in the second half. John Lawler : Yes. So John, it is different, right? Ever since we've had COVID and coming out of COVID, the patterns just haven't held. When you look at the second half versus the first half, I think that would be the best way to help kind of frame this up. We do see continued volume, mix and pricing being strong on a half-over-half basis. And of course, we do expect to see commodities improve a bit as well in the second half on a half-over-half basis. And so volume, pricing and mix, let's say, in the $3 billion range. Commodities could be as much as $0.5 billion. But the inflation that we're seeing, that's going to continue to run through. And we're seeing that across the board from material costs, freight, fuel costs, et cetera. So we see that continuing, and that's up, as I said in my remarks, versus what we had talked about at the end of the last quarter.  And then, of course, FMCC is going to be down slightly half over half, let's say, eight-tenths to $1 billion as they approach $3 billion for the year.  We're also seeing headwinds in the second half, John, from currency, the dollar strengthening. And we have more revenue exposure overseas than we do costs. So we're going to see some of that happen as well. And then we're going to continue to invest in our growth, and that'll be an area of engineering. We'll also see increasing investments in connectivity and spending.  And then, I guess, the last thing I would talk about just to make the half over half complete. We did have some onetime items come to us in the second quarter, roughly an insurance claim and a contract we renegotiated, which roughly would be maybe three-tenths, four-tenths headwinds. So that's basically how we frame up the half over half. And basically, what we're saying is that there'll be some headwinds and some tailwinds, but we're confident in our guidance of 11.5 to 12.5. John Murphy : That's very helpful. And then, Jim, just on these higher trim levels or pseudo special additions, I mean it's Ford Raptor, I mean, the F-150 Raptor are pretty great looking trucks. You guys put in the slide deck there, looking forward to driving that, hopefully, sometime soon. But it seems like there's a real opportunity for Blue, but there might be a Model E for these high-trim level special -- sort of special editions. I mean how much of an opportunity is there on mix go forward maybe in both divisions? And how do you think about going after that? Because that seems like that's something you could be a lot more sustainable than maybe just the supply/demand imbalance we have right now that's helping price. James Farley : Thank you, John. We've always been really good on the truck side for those derivatives, but now our chances to expand that capability across all of our lineup. Ranger is a good example. We're launching it in Thailand. We just launched Raptor, Tremor. There's a lot we can do. Of course, Mustang is coming out. Maverick is our most affordable vehicle. You can only imagine the kind of things that we're cooking up in our design studio with Maverick. And then, of course, on what we really do well, Broncos, you can imagine high-end versions, all sorts of things. Everglade came out, very popular.  And we do agree our E side -- we don't have to change the body to refresh Mach-E, for example. We are actually completely redoing in a good way our HMI and OTA-ing that to all of our EVs. But you can imagine with Mustang Mach-E all the cool things we could do. So -- and it is a sustainable advantage, and we're good at it.  The tension point for us, though, is complexity. Ford is way too complex. So as we do this, we have to bring our complexity down to get our bill of materials kind of in line with competition. It's great that we have all this pricing power forward. We do have a fresh lineup. We have lots of cool ideas. But we're not satisfied with that because we cannot just continue to build this complexity in our business. So as we add those derivatives, we're going to have to -- we are planning much less complexity in our Blue business. And that is a theme that will run through Blue for years to come. John Murphy : Jim, if I could just follow up real quick on the Model E side to create a performance version of like the Mustang Mach-E might theoretically cost a lot less, but you might still be able to charge as much as you might on that delta on a Blue vehicle. Is that correct? And could we see sort of these specials or trim levels potentially garner even higher variable margin as we move into the Model E world? Is that a fair statement or not? James Farley : I think the way we look at -- yes. Good question. The way we look at this, John, is the days are kind of over where you have to change the upper body to build a supercar or to build an off-road car like kind of days are over, like, we don't have to do that anymore with these digital products, with EV propulsion, with the motors, the software. We can - we can really take our vehicles and make very different kind of vehicles off of the same body engineering. And that is a complete game changer for us in terms of capital intensity, i.e., lower.  And I'm really glad you brought that up because I try to emphasize this. Like we have to be really careful in our industry, and I'm constantly -- we are constantly talking about this as a leadership team. We cannot have the complexity of top hats that we do on our ICE business.  We have an opportunity as we go digital with these EVs to simplify our body engineering and put the engineer where customers really care. And it's not a different [fender] (ph). It's software. It's a digital display technology. It's a self-driving system and the AV tech. And of course, it's going to be, some cases, more powerful motors. Operator : And the next question is from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam Jonas : Jim, the Bronco Raptor, so badass. I don't know if I put an order and now if I'll get it by the end of the decade, but maybe I'll try. Jim, this is one of the most positive Ford calls I can remember in a long, long time. Does Ford have too many people? James Farley : As I said in my comments, Adam, we absolutely have too many people in certain places, no doubt about it. And we have skills that don't work anymore. We -- and we have jobs that need to change. And we have lots of new work statements that we've never had before.  We are literally virtually -- we are reshaping our company, like every part of our company. And on our ICE business, we want to simplify it. We want to make sure the skills we have and the work statements we have are as lean as possible. We know our costs are not competitive at Ford. We are -- that's what I mean by we are not satisfied. But I just want to emphasize that in the past, at least in my career for 40 years, we kind of often and discriminately just taking the costs out. That's not what's happening at Ford now. This is a different kind of change where we're reshaping the company, reshaping skills, investing in new technologies and simplifying investments in others, i.e., spending less.  So do we have too many -- is kind of the old adage. Yes, I think every company probably has too many people. I just -- we have to go do the workflows and decide how this works now going forward. Adam Jonas : All right. Appreciate that, Jim. Just one follow-up on the dealers. They're having an amazing time. Their new gross margins have more than tripled, and they're making dealer grosses that are, in many cases, higher than what you're making on selling the product, right? Like they're making more money selling the product that you -- the margin you're making on actually making the product. And all they're doing is just watching the things come off a truck, and they're presold. So I know you guys spent a huge amount of time on pricing at Ford. Is there anything you can do to help even the score a bit on price? Because when I ask the dealers, why isn't Ford raising -- or your peers are raising some of the invoice more, even they don't have a reason like we don't know why they're not doing it. And then they often say things that I don't believe, which is that you can't or you're not moving fast enough or the systems aren't there. So what are we missing? James Farley : Sure. So bottom line is we've taken a lot of pricing. You could see it in our numbers. And actually, we all watch this very carefully at Ford. What is the dealers retained margin versus MSRP? And I have to tell you that ours is one of the best in the industry, i.e., our pricing and the retained margin at MSRP are as close at Ford versus any other brand. There are others that are in different places.  I think your question is actually bigger than that, which is we have ups and downs in our industry. And how is this going to -- how is our retailers going to shape as we change this company? And so -- and again, on the electric vehicles, dynamic pricing is very important for us because we went to an ordering system. And with an ordering system, you have the certainty of orders, but you have to also be responsive on price. I'm not going to get into the details, but we think we have a way out of that tension point or conundrum.  On overall, how I see dealer margins, as we talk to our dealers and roll up our sleeves, is we need -- because I said our competitors are pure-play EVs and the Chinese that are absolutely coming. And that means we have to get this $2,000 out of our distribution cost to be competitive with them. And we think 1/3 of it is going to a low inventory model, not -- I'm not saying like 30-day supply or 50. I don't mean that kind of -- like the customer orders a vehicle, and then we ship the vehicle to the customer. That's what I mean by a low inventory model. We have to go to that. We think that's about -- worth maybe $600, $700 in our system. Another one is all the selling, SG&A and advertising costs. We have 3 tiers of marketing. We think that's another $600 a vehicle. We're going to simplify that. And we're going to just shift where the e-commerce platform that we don't have today -- all of our e-customers have a very predictable experience, whether they're in a dealership or in their bunny slippers, and they'll have a very simple, transparent, very easy purchase process. And we're going to invest. Our marketing model is going to be post purchase. That will be our differentiator, and that's where we'll invest. And I think that's a different play than the pure EV companies. So I see dealer margins still being very competitive, but they are going to shift. The makeup of those margins going to change. Does that make sense, Adam? Adam Jonas : Makes a lot of sense. Operator : The next question will come from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Rod Lache : So pricing has been a massive tailwind, and it looks like mix is becoming pretty powerful now, too. Can you just talk to us a little bit about the interplay between affordability and volume? Just especially in the environment that we're in right now and with still a lot of inflation on the horizon, do you think demand can return at this level of price? And are you willing to forgo volume to sustain contribution margins? John Lawler : Yes. Thanks, Rod. So we have seen strength in volume -- pricing due to the volume that we can produce as an industry and us at Ford relative to the demand that we're seeing out there. So that has been a tailwind. In the quarter, we did see quite a bit of a tailwind from mix as well.  Affordability is something that we keep in front of us all the time with the credit company, and we're very thoughtful about where it's headed from the standpoint to the consumer, what's affordable, et cetera. But we have not seen demand come off at this point. But we have -- as we increase volumes through the second half of the year as some of the chip constraints ease and we see a better rate and flow, we do have provisioned in our second half incentives increasing as volumes come back. And we've always said that the relationship between volume and pricing is going to remain dynamic.  And so I think what you'll see is as volume comes back, you will see some pricing get back. You will see prices come down some. Question for all of us is how are we going to manage stocks? How are we going to move to the build-to-order process? How are we going to change the dynamics and not have as much of a push system and have more of a natural demand system and fulfilling that demand on a timely basis? So I think that's the question for all of us, and we need to maintain discipline as we head into an environment where we could potentially see demand come off and/or we start to have higher supply, and therefore, prices will come well.  But remember, following up on what Adam just said in the dealer margins, we still have -- across the industry, dealer margins need to come down first from a pricing standpoint, right? We did -- as we've talked about in the past, we took an action, which reduced floor plan for the dealers, which was a form of pricing for us. But overall, it's still inflated. And I'd estimate somewhere between $1,300 to $1,700 of dealer margin compression is to come off first from a pricing standpoint. Rod Lache : That makes sense. And then just secondly, can you just provide any color you can on what's happening from a supply chain perspective? Any thoughts on whether this Europe natural gas situation is something that is a major concern for you? And then lastly, any detail on the $3 billion of cost inflation in North America? It looked like a large number. Was there anything unusual in that number? John Lawler : No, there wasn't anything unusual, Rod. I'll start with that. It's across the board. It's in the areas you would expect, material cost going up. We're seeing increases in freight. It's just across the board, and it's driven by the inflationary pressures we're seeing across the board in the economy. Nothing unusual. James Farley : And on the supply chain, I'd to characterize it, I mean, chips are still an issue. Transparency is still an issue in the second quarter specifically. You know we had quite an issue in China with the Shanghai shutdown. And that affects -- that could have affected our North America manufacturing system. The team did a great job. We had a daily call. We worked every issue. We built a digital model of all our supply chain down to supply chain in, and it was really helpful. And we got through it. Like Rosana Rosana Dana said, if it's not one thing, it's another.  It just feels like what's next. As far as we're planning everything we know could happen. The next possibility of the energy crisis in Europe, we played this out already. We've done our homework. We have about 550 active suppliers in what I would call the high-risk countries like Czech, Germany, Hungary, Austria and Slovakia. We think that the risk is between now and mid-'23 when they can manage through the energy issues. We have about 130 suppliers for our North America vehicle production in that 550 list, and we now have a 30-day buffer stock. So we are doing everything we can with the things we know. On the supply chain outside of -- we have labor shortages and all sorts of moving. The suppliers have been working nonstop during COVID, so machine maintenance and a lot of other things. We see the output of the stress in the supply chain. And obviously, their costs have gone up, too. And we're working through all of that with our suppliers. So I think we're well prepared for the things we can predict, but it's always a new day. Operator : The next question will be from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank. Emmanuel Rosner : My first question, I was hoping to ask you about the topic of EV profitability. So Jim, during the quarter at an investor conference, I think you essentially gave some pretty good color on where Ford is standing right now. And I think you spoke about the cost of the Mach-E being a disadvantage of $25,000 to $27,000 versus a similarly [indiscernible]. So I guess my questions would be, how do you plan on offsetting this over time? I guess what is the strategy going forward? And should we worry about large losses from EVs in the near term over the next few years as the EV volumes increase materially over the next few years? James Farley : Well, thank you, Emmanuel. I will say there's not going to be a lot of guess work at Ford because we will financially report our businesses independently of each other. So it will be all out there for everyone to see. I don't know about others. But at Ford, it will be extremely transparent. I'm not going to get into specifics because I think this is such a material topic. We need to spend time on it. We can't rush to this.  I will tell you that in the quarter, our announcement for LFP bringing that to North America is a big deal from a profit standpoint. That is a very important chemistry on our road map for profitability. We're going to be installing 60 -- 40-gigawatt hours in North America. That's a lot. And we are not going to wait until that installed capacity is here. We're going to be bringing those batteries to our highest volume vehicles like next year. So that's one, but there's distribution. There's the size of your battery. You're engineering for low labor content. And I just don't think we're going to do justice such as series and important topic in the earnings call. But you can expect a lot of engagement with Ford on this, and this is an incredibly important focus. This is one of the reasons why we created Model E, to be laser-focused on profitable electric vehicles. And again, you'll see it all.  John, do you want to add any comments on the segmentation reporting? John Lawler : No. In segmentation reporting, you'll see exactly where we're at between the 5 businesses. And Emmanuel, we know how important that is. So when we have our Capital Markets Day early next year, we'll unpack that in more detail, as Jim said, where we can spend some time on it and go through it and give it to do justice. Emmanuel Rosner : Okay. That's fair. So let me ask you a separate topic then. So I think one of the hardest things for investors here is to try to performance sensitivity for a downturn scenario as consumer comes under more pressure, risk of recession increase. What could that do for not so much volume because, obviously, we've been -- auto has been operating at low volume for a while, supply-driven, but pricing. Any thoughts you could share with us either based on history or in the current context on how would you go about flexing down vehicle pricing in a downturn scenario? John Lawler : Yes. So Emmanuel, we spent a lot of time on this, as you would expect us to be doing, modeling scenarios, looking at what that means for the business, looking at what we should be doing today to get out in front of any these types of issues if a recession were to come. But the way we're thinking about it is if you step back and look at where we're at today relative to where we've been as a company, heading into any -- what could be a potential downturn, right, we're in much better shape. You mentioned it from a demand standpoint. We have 3 years of pent-up demand, and we have a very strong product lineup. And so that's a positive.  We're also at a point right now where incentives are low, right? They're in the single digits versus what normally, at this point in the cycle, we'd probably be in high teens. And so of course, as volume or demand comes off, there will be some pricing that will need to be given back. And that's a bit of a release valve, if you will. But it's really important for us to be thoughtful about that, not only Ford, but as an industry.  And then the other thing I would say, and I mentioned it in my remarks, our business is very different than what it was in the past. Our ICE product, clearly, it's more -- our lineup is more profitable as we've exited unprofitable vehicles. But we've de-risked the overall business. We restructured our markets overseas. And I think a great proof point for that is the fact that between '18 and '21, we burned through $9 billion of free cash flow overseas. We're not in that position now. And we do expect this year, we're projecting that our overseas markets will be free cash flow positive. So we're just in a completely different position. We're modeling it. We're looking at it. We're getting out in front of things, as Jim said, that we can today. But it's a new day every day. But that's how we're thinking about it. We're clear-eyed. We understand what we're facing. We understand what could potentially be in front of us, and now we need to work it. Operator : And the next question will be from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo. . Colin Langan : I just wanted to circle back to the first question going from the first half to second half. The outlook dividend point is about flat. You highlighted, I think, [indiscernible] volume. I think the commodities is over $1 billion in [indiscernible] Q1 and Q2. You highlighted about $1 billion of Ford Credit sort of -- that's about $3 billion is good news. You didn't quantify the bad news. [indiscernible], it doesn't seem like [indiscernible] be that material. Any sort of framing it, is that $3 billion inflationary cost predominantly in the second half? Is that [indiscernible]? John Lawler : Yes. So Colin, let me clarify. It's really hard to hear you. It's quite static-y. But Ford Credit will be about $3 billion in total profits for the year. So that'll be down half over half. So that's a headwind. And the inflationary costs on a half over half are a headwind. And so when you walk through it, yes, there will be some volume. We said that volumes in the second half will be up roughly in the low 20 percentage range versus the first half. And so you've got some mix improvement as well. So volume and pricing and mix are the tailwinds. A little bit of a tailwind on commodities, but the headwinds are FMCC profits. They'll be down. We've got the inflationary pressures we talked about, will be an increase in the second half. We also have exchange that's hitting us in the second half relative to the first half. So that's a headwind as well. And then we had some onetimers in the second quarter that aren't going to repeat.  And of course, we're going to continue to invest in the business. So there's going to be spending-related costs. There's going to be connectivity costs that will be increasing as well as we invest. So those are the puts and takes. Those are the tailwinds and the headwinds as you look at it from a half-over-half basis. And I hope that helps clarify things. Colin Langan : Okay. And to follow up, I know you clearly are going to give more details on the E perspective and how you're going to assess things. But you're talking a pretty dramatic increase in raw material costs. I think even in your comments, you indicated that only about 50% of the materials are going to be available to produce all the EV targets, which kind of would imply that prices of the raw materials would actually remain high. Should you be thinking about pulling back on some of the EV investments if the economics at this point are unclear? James Farley : No. No. We don't plan on pulling back. If anything, the first generation of products has aspired us to go faster. I think I would just emphasize that how we look at this change in our industry, it's not a change in propulsion. It's much bigger than that. It's a change to a vehicle whose differentiation will increasingly be software that you ship to the vehicle. We now have real experience on the first shippable software to these cars. The first is ADAS for sure. And the second one for us is Ford Pro. We're shipping telematics to the customer, driver coaching, energy management. Our attach rate for charging now on our E-Transits, we're 95% share. It's like 30-plus percent. So there are a lot of services connected to these vehicles because of the software. And that's a really big revenue opportunity for us.  When you talk about the base walk to 8%, we're not going to -- as John said, we're not going to go through that here, but I will tell you that LFP has a dramatically different exposure to raw materials than an NCM sell. Like there's no nickel in it.  So the chemistry strategy for the company and diversifying that is a very key part of our profitability walk. But I think the most important thing to think about is not that we're investing or not in electric cars. We're investing in digital products, and we can keep them longer because we don't have to upgrade the upper bodies because they're software-enabled vehicles. There's so much we can do to change the profit profile of these vehicles. The biggest thing we have to solve for in all of that is the battery cost, and we can't wait to take you through all of that. Operator : And the next question will come from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets. Joseph Spak : I just want to -- John, can we just go over -- so $3 billion of other inflationary costs, it's $2 billion higher than before. Are you -- I know you're working to offset it. Are you assuming you offset that delta in the guide? And maybe you could just let us know how much of that was already incurred in the first half. John Lawler : So we had -- it's $1 billion higher than what we had talked about previously, Joe. So we're looking at about $3 billion for the year, and that's part of what we're doing. We're working to offset those inflationary costs, and that's something that we need to continue to work through. We're not all the way there, of course, but we're working on it, and we do have the rest of the year to go, and it is a significant focus of our team, as we've talked about. But the cost efforts are a significant focus of the team as we remake the company in Ford+. So that's a really important part of what we're doing. And so it's $3 billion for the year. We had said $2 billion. We've seen about another $1 billion come through, and it's across the board. Joseph Spak : Okay. The second question is just on Ford Credit. So you're pointing to a lower second half, which, if you annualize that, would get you to something in the low 2s. Is that a good base to think about next year and go forward? Because if we look at the pretax ROE in this business, it's been well above average, and I think we understand why there's been some unusual circumstances. But is that the right way that you're thinking about it that to return to sort of more normal or historical returns? Or is there anything structural under effect Ford Credit that's changed the profitability profile? Marion Harris : Joe, this is Marion here. Thanks for the question. You're thinking about it correctly. So if you go back to pre-COVID, and balance sheet was quite a bit larger, we were at about $145 billion at that time. We were at a run rate of about $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion of EBT. And so that was the normal level. Our balance sheet is somewhat smaller now. And so I think what you're seeing is a more normalized level of profits. We're back at our pre-COVID reserve level. We're not releasing reserves and the related to lease residuals, that's pretty much worked its way through its book. So you're seeing that more normal performance. Operator : And our final question of today will come from James Picariello from Exane PNB Paribas. James Picariello : Just for commodities, at current spot rates, just as a theoretical exercise, right, if we take into account the lagging effect to your P&L, can you just think about maybe directionally just what commodities -- what the commodities impact would look like for next year at current spot rates? John Lawler : Yes. I think we do see it coming off some. Part of what complicates the commodity situation is as we go through in a year, we lock into contracts, and they roll. That protects us on the [indiscernible] when prices are increasing some, but it also has a lag effect when prices are coming down some. And so we'll have to deal with that as we run through the year as well. And so I think, really, it's going to depend on what happens with the overall macroeconomic environment. If we do see us tripping into more of a recessionary period, we should see those fall quicker like we have in the past. If not, I think that they'll come down more moderately. So we're planning and looking at both of those scenarios from a spot standpoint. It is good news as we roll through next year, but you can't just take that spot good news and roll it through everything because we do have contracts that were locked into on a rolling basis through the year. James Picariello : Okay. Understood. And then just with respect to the cadence for the second half, I mean, how should we be thinking about the quarterly volume -- the volume ramp in the back half? And can you provide color on Ford's progress in shipping the [indiscernible] inventory, I think, totaled 53,000 entering the quarter? John Lawler : Yes. So 53,000 entering the quarter. The team did a good job on the drawdown. We're down to 18,000 at the end of the quarter, and we'll work to get those out over the second half of the year as we can free up the chips that impacted us.  I think when you look at the volumes, in the second quarter, we saw an increase in volumes in North America, which helped drive the strong performance for North America. When you look at the second half, as we said, volumes would be up in the low 20% range compared with the first half. But that volume growth -- there's greater volume growth in the overseas markets in the second half than in North America. We have the Ranger launching in IMG. We have volume in the second half growing at a quicker rate in Europe. And then, of course, China was significantly depressed from a volume standpoint in the second quarter due to the shutdown. And so that's what will be happening from a standpoint.  But when you look at the volumes for Q3, they'll be lower than they will be in Q4 because in Q4, we should see the rate fall, the chips improve as we go through the third quarter into the fourth quarter. So that's how the volume is framing up in the second half relative to the first half, and then the walk from Q2 into Q3. So volume and mix in Q3 -- Q3 is going to be less than Q2, right? It's not going to be as strong as Q2. We have a couple of things hitting us in Q3. Volume and mix, most of the volume growth in Q3 relative to Q2 is going to be in Europe and China. And then we still have commodity costs hitting us, and we're investing in connectivity. And our spending will -- in the third quarter, Ford Credit, of course, as the second half is lower than the first half. You see that come through in the third quarter. And then we have the nonrepeat of the onetimers I talked about in the second quarter. So third quarter will be down compared to the second quarter. Volume increases will be overseas. And then as we get to the fourth quarter, volume in the fourth quarter on a sequential basis will be better than the third quarter.

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thanks, Gary. Welcome to Ford Motor Company\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, our President and CEO; and John Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A are Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit; and Doug Field, Chief Advanced Product Development and Technology Officer for Ford Model e. Today\u2019s discussions include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Today\u2019s discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on page 23. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis, and product mix is volume weighted. Looking at our IR calendar, we have two upcoming engagements. Tomorrow, Bank of America will host a fireside chat with John Lawler and Lisa Drake, our VP of EV Industrialization and Manufacturing Engineering for Ford Model e. On November 7th, tech analyst, Toni Sacconaghi, will host a fireside chat with Doug Field at the AllianceBernstein\u2019s Electric Revolution Conference in London. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jim Farley. Jim Farley : Thank you, Lynn. Hi, everyone. We really appreciate you being with us today. We introduced the Ford+ Plan for growth and value creation two years ago, and the investment thesis had three drivers : leveraging our iconic vehicles, our strengths, both geographically and nameplates; number two, add to that, integrated hardware, software and connectivity into those vehicles; and then expand the total addressable market and unlocking value with Conquest EVs, new commercial vehicles, connected services and physical services as well as mobility. So today, I\u2019d like to share a progress report on Ford\u2019s transformation, of course, update you on our autonomy strategy and our announcement and, of course, recap the quarter. Our ambition to be the leader in EV is already taking shape. In our home market, Ford Model e is now -- has now had incredible successful launch of three products. They\u2019re now in scaling F-150 Lightning, Mach-E and E-Transit, and each are attracting, interesting for us, almost all new customers. So, this is growth. We\u2019re now the number two electric brand in the U.S., and we\u2019re just beginning with our scaling. Our decision to create Blue for both ICE and hybrid vehicles has focused and energized our team to leverage what we do best at Ford. We have launched a string of hits that our products -- our customers not only love, but have lined up to buy, and we have so many more exciting products to come. We have made tough capital allocation and restructuring decisions like the one today, particularly in South America and our international market groups like India and our results and cash flow, you could see in our results, have improved dramatically. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with nearly $50 billion in liquidity, even as we accelerate investments in connectivity and electrification. And what is perhaps the biggest untold story at Ford, we\u2019ve successfully recruited a roster of an incredible talent from some of the world\u2019s best technology companies who are here to ship product and are supercharging our ability to design that software-defined vehicle and, of course, the software and services that go into those vehicles for the future. At the same token and at the same time, we have still so much work ahead. Clearly, we need to continue to improve our competitiveness, not just on quality, but on cost and supply chain management. And our performance in China and Europe is not nearly as healthy as we\u2019d like it to be. I can\u2019t overstate the sense of urgency we have to address these critical operating areas. I look forward to updating you on future calls. Now, I\u2019d like to share an important strategic shift in our autonomous vehicle strategy. Five years ago, we committed to invest $1 billion in Argo AI to develop autonomous Level 4 technology. In 2020, we completed the transaction that resulted in Ford and VW both owning the majority of Argo at equal levels. We still believe in Level 4 autonomy that it will have a big impact on our business of moving people. We\u2019ve learned though in our partnership with Argo and after our own internal investments, that we will have a very long road. It\u2019s estimated that more than $100 billion has been invested in the promise of Level 4 autonomy. And yet no one has defined a profitable business model at scale. Based on the change in this outlook and our increasing promise and focus on Level 2+ and Level 3 autonomy, we\u2019ve decided to wind down the Argo business and impair the investment. We\u2019re working closely with Argo and VW on all the details. But here\u2019s what I want to focus on. Advancing Level 2 hardware and software beyond what BlueCruise can do today and ultimately enabling our customers to travel in very large ODDs, or operating domains, with their eyes off the road will give them back the single most valuable commodity in our modern lives, time. This has become mission-critical for us at Ford. Ford has deployed BlueCruise on many vehicles across hundreds of thousands of Blue zone miles. We have strong technology partners working alongside us. And now, we\u2019re going to bring in several hundred people from Argo, a brilliant collection of minds, who\u2019ve done a great job, who have done wonderful work in the L4 space, but their job and mission now is to help us create a differentiated Level 4 BlueCruise system. Yes, there are huge -- this is a huge addressable market and the potential for highly accretive new revenue streams tied to Level 3, but at the end of the day, this is about giving millions of people that time and eliminating the monotony of highway miles and stop-and-go traffic. And as for the future of true L4 autonomy, we don\u2019t expect there to be a sudden aha moment like we used to. Deploying L4 broadly, perhaps the toughest technical problem of our time, will require significant breakthroughs going forward in many areas : reliable and low-cost sensing, it\u2019s not the case today; algorithms that can operate on limited compute resources without constraining the operating time and domain of an electric vehicle; breakthroughs in neural networks that can learn to operate a car more safely than a human, even in very complex urban environments. The muscles we have built with our new talent in broadly deploying a transformative Blue Cruise L3 system will ultimately be essential to the future of accessible driverless vehicles in everyday life. What\u2019s so exciting for me is that we are on the cusp of a transformational moment for Ford. We will introduce a lineup of not first, but second cycle EVs that are not only fully software updatable and constantly improving, but they will generate an 8% plus margin, an amazing array of software-enabled services, not just BlueCruise L3, but many others, video services for software -- for safety and security, and we\u2019re already shipping a broad range of Ford Pro productivity tools and 100% uptime services for our commercial customers. That is a transformation for us. Let me now switch to the quarter. With Ford Model e, we\u2019re on track to reach our annual production rate of 600,000 EVs by the end of next year and 2 million by 2026. I\u2019ll say that carefully. There is no change to our target. We\u2019re adding shifts to the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightings as we speak, and we\u2019re scaling production of E-Transit. In Europe, our all-new EV manufacturing center in Cologne will finish complete -- will be complete in turning out vehicles midway through next year. Our Ford Otosan JV in Turkey is not only scaling the 2-ton E-Transit, but they\u2019re also going to be launching a brand-new product, a 1-ton E-Transit custom electric while breaking ground on a new battery plant that will supply those for those transits. And in September, we\u2019re starting production -- we\u2019ve already started construction of Blue Oval City in Tennessee, where we will build a new generation EV truck and batteries. And at the same time, we\u2019ve already broken ground as well on the new BlueOval SK battery plants, plural, in Kentucky. We\u2019re also further strengthening Model e\u2019s EV supply chain. Our team is making great progress in securing raw materials, importantly the processing of those raw materials and the battery capacity that we need. We expect the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act to have a wide range of positive impacts for both our customers and for Ford. What\u2019s not yet clear is the degree to which the IRA will drive customer demand versus offsetting our EV investments in growth. So, let me touch on some of the potential benefits of the IRA. The first opportunity is our largest, the battery production tax credit of about $45 per kilowatt hour. From \u201823 to \u201826, we estimate a combined available tax credit for Ford and our battery partners could total more than $7 billion with large step-up in annual credits in \u201827 as our JV battery plants ramp up to full production. The second benefit is often overlooked. I haven\u2019t actually read any one of the media covering this, but it\u2019s super important for Ford. And that\u2019s the commercial EV credit. You know that Ford is the number one commercial vehicle brand in the U.S., and our commercial customers can now claim next year $7,500 per EV vehicle they buy with no restrictions on battery sourcing or manufacturing. Our preliminary estimate is that between 55% and 65% of all of our commercial vehicle customers will qualify. The third opportunity is retail. Ford EVs and our PHEVs remain eligible for the $7,500 tax credit until guidance is issued at the end of this year. Next year, we believe we\u2019ll meet the $3,750 critical materials credit requirement on certain Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning models. In \u201824, the rules will further restrict this critical materials credit. So, we believe it\u2019s playing -- a fairly level playing field right now for all the OEMs as our supply chains of critical material extraction and course processing in the U.S. and FTA develops. The fourth benefit centers on the funding growth in our investments, such as geothermal energy credit critical for Blue Oval City, the Department of Energy loans, grants to convert our domestic facilities to produce electric vehicles, battery plants and other EV components. We\u2019re exploring all these capabilities and possibilities as you can imagine. Now, as you know, we shared the new electric customer standards with all of our North America dealers last month in Vegas. That means a single, simple e-commerce platform, ultra-low vehicle-finished inventory, non-negotiated pricing and fast charges at all of our dealerships. Now early response from the dealers have been very favorable. Many are poised to invest to meet these new standards for electric vehicle customers, while other dealers will opt to specialize Ford Blue Oval or Ford Pro. And there\u2019s real rewards for going first. Turning to Ford Blue. We view this business Ford Blue as growth. Last month, we unveiled the seventh generation Mustang. We showed the all-new amazing Super Duty in Churchill Downs in Kentucky. And there -- these are all very well-executed products with incredible technology and upgraded electrical architectures with advanced powertrains, and they really set them apart from the competition. What you can\u2019t see is what we see. Our design studio is filled with new products and derivatives that will expand our hit franchises like F-150 and Bronco and Mustang and the new Maverick and the Explorer and the Ranger, all segments that we\u2019re a leader among the leaders. And I can\u2019t wait to show you these new derivatives based on ICE and hybrid powertrains. Finally, let\u2019s talk about Pro. In the U.S., customers trust us more than -- with more than 40% of the market for full-sized commercial trucks and vans. In Europe, we\u2019re also the number one commercial vehicle brand. That\u2019s for 7 years now, soon to be 8. Businesses of all sizes and types are using Ford Pro\u2019s vehicles as well as the suite of our services to lower their cost and improve their productivity. Now, that includes multi-mix fleets, and fleets that are a mix of ICE and EVs. Ford Pro has a real opportunity to grow service and parts sales by offering better experiences like mobile service. We expect to have more than 1,200 mobile service units in operation globally by the end of this year, and they\u2019re driving significant dealer parts and service revenue. Actually, more than $10,000 per global -- per unit, service unit, per month. But the real game changer for us in the Pro business, in parts and service growth, is software, software centered on productivity, telematics, security and predictive failure of all components. In the third quarter, we saw our paid telematics for Pro grow by over 40% sequentially for the third straight quarter. Our suite of Ford Pro software solutions keeps getting stronger and stronger, as we launch new offerings like Ford Pro fleet and the VIIZR field service management software. But before I hand it over to John, let me end with this. We have many challenges as a company, and we\u2019re tackling them head-on. That\u2019s clear from our third quarter results. At the same time, I\u2019m so excited about the future we\u2019re creating with Ford+. We\u2019re building completely new businesses with the best of Ford talent and incredibly -- incredible new talent across not just Model e, but Ford Blue and Ford Pro. We\u2019re strengthening our product portfolio across the board, building on what we think is the strongest portfolio we\u2019ve ever had. And we\u2019re tracking the scale to a global run rate of 2 million EVs a year by 2026, and we\u2019re investing in growth. Taken together, this work statement is nothing short of refounding one of the world\u2019s most iconic companies to compete and win in a brand-new era. There\u2019s no holding back. There\u2019s no looking back. There\u2019s no slowing down. In fact, we\u2019re accelerating our transformation. John? John Lawler : Thanks, Jim. So, when I look at the quarter and our performance year-to-date, I actually see some real promises. First, our strategic actions to segment and stand out three distinct businesses, Ford Model e, Ford Blue and Ford Pro, while complete yet, is truly transformational and is already changing how we manage the business. So, it\u2019s about more than just accelerating profitable growth, it\u2019s also about how we are going to do that by orienting everything around our different types of customers. The separation of these businesses is revealing to the entire organization how deeply rooted complexity is in our legacy business and how this disadvantages us in quality, innovation, customer satisfaction and ultimately, cost and efficiency. And we see it everywhere, from design, to engineering, to manufacturing and how we interact with each other and our suppliers. And so, to me, this is really exciting. We understand the magnitude of opportunity and leverage that this will provide across the entire business. Now, we just need to deliver. Second, our product portfolio has never been stronger. Starting with our top-selling first-generation EVs like Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning and E-Transit to our new models of category-leading vehicles like Mustang and Super Duty as well as popular derivatives like Raptor and Tremor. These are all inspiring products that our customers love. And finally, our capital allocation choices are really paying off. Our sustainable free cash flow generation from our automotive business is improving significantly, even as we accelerate investments in electrification and connectivity. And this improvement reflects the tough choices that we have made to focus on our strengths, hone our footprint and our product portfolio, especially outside of North America. So, with that as a backdrop, let me turn to our financial results for the quarter. We delivered $1.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, above the $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion guidance range we provided last month. In automotive, wholesales were up 7% year-over-year. However, EBIT was weighed down by the rich mix of 40,000 vehicles on wheels we had in inventory at the end of the quarter and about $1 billion in lump-sum supplier settlements. The settlements offset costs incurred by our suppliers, partially due to inflationary impacts on labor, freight and commodities as well as higher costs because of our inconsistent production schedule, which has been disruptive for our partners. So, providing greater certainty and schedule stability to our supply base is just one example of the many opportunities we have in front of us as we transform our global supply chain. So, we\u2019re very grateful for our suppliers\u2019 ongoing support and the collaborative approach they are taking to address production shortfalls, while also focusing on improving the quality of the parts they ship to us. In the quarter, we delivered $3.6 billion in free cash flow with strong cash generation by our automotive business, despite the adverse effects of the 40,000 vehicles on wheels. We expect the negative working capital impact of those units to reverse in the fourth quarter when the vehicles are completed and shipped to dealers. Our balance sheet continues to be very healthy. And we ended the quarter with strong cash and liquidity of $32 billion and $49 billion, respectively. And these numbers include our remaining stake in Rivian, which was valued at less than $1 billion at the end of the quarter. Now, I\u2019ll touch on the performance of our business units. North America delivered $1.3 billion of EBIT and a margin of 5%. Both of those measures were driven down year-over-year by higher commodity costs, inflationary pressures and a diverse mix, reflecting the buildup of vehicles on wheels and inventory. Our brand strength and order banks remain very strong, and we expect the North American margin to return to double digits in the fourth quarter. South America continues to benefit from our global redesign efforts, delivering strong margins in its fifth consecutive profitable quarter. In Europe, we posted a profit of $200 million. And supply chain constraints began to ease, resulting in sequential wholesale growth of 23%. Our commercial vehicle business continues to fortify its leadership position ending the quarter with a 15.2% share year-to-date. And in China, we posted a loss of $200 million, driven by the investments we are making in electric vehicles. Lincoln continues to be a bright spot for the region with share improving again sequentially. Our International Markets Group continues to be solidly profitable. EBIT margins were over 8%, driven by the launch of our exciting all-new Ranger. And then finally, Ford Credit delivered another strong quarter with EBT of $600 million that reflected a more normalized run rate for this business. The anticipated sequential profit decline was driven by the non-operating release of credit loss reserves and higher borrowing costs. Let me now walk through our impairment of Argo. As Jim highlighted, it\u2019s become clear that the technology required to achieve profitable commercialization of L4 autonomy at scale is going to take much longer than we previously expected. L2+ and L3 driver assist technologies have a larger addressable customer base, which will allow it to scale more quickly and profitably, and that\u2019s going to provide accretive annuity-like revenue streams. During the third quarter, we made the strategic decision to shift our capital spending from the L4 technology being developed by Argo to internally develop L2+/L3 technology. And as a result, in the third quarter, we recorded a $2.7 billion noncash pretax impairment as a special item. Now, let me share with you our current outlook. For the year, we expect to earn about $11.5 billion in adjusted EBIT, up about 15% from 2021 with about a 10% increase in wholesales. We\u2019re now projecting to generate adjusted free cash flow of $9.5 billion to $10 billion. Our year-over-year basis for our \u201822 adjusted EBIT target assumes significantly higher earnings in North America; aggregate profitability in the rest of the world; Ford Credit EBT at about $2.7 billion, with strong, though lower, auction values in the fourth quarter as the supply of new vehicles improves and higher borrowing costs; continued strong pent-up demand in orders for Ford\u2019s newest products; continued strength in pricing; higher commodity and broad-based inflationary costs of about $9 billion; no further deterioration in supply chain; and continuation of a strong dollar. So finally, before getting to your questions, let me provide a quick update on our new financial reporting. Last quarter, we mentioned our plan to host a teach-in event early next year to help you prepare for this change to a radically new strategic organization ahead of our first quarter 2023 reporting. So, we\u2019ve now fixed the date for March. At the teach-in, we will share both, 2021 and 2022 revised results to reflect our new segmentation, which we will start using for reporting purposes in Q1 of 2023. But because this is far more than an accounting exercise, we\u2019ll also reiterate and illustrate the business rationale for the change along with the reporting mechanics and implications for our earnings disclosures and SEC filings, and we\u2019ll furnish you with a full toolkit to help you transition your models. So, that wraps up our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll use the balance of the time to address what\u2019s on your minds. And thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good evening, guys. Thanks for all the detail. There\u2019s a lot of questions. I\u2019ll try to keep it to one here. On the pivot from AV to ADAS or semiautonomous, Jim, there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces here. But there are some out there that believe they have a solution to this that\u2019s close to working. And I think some of us thought that Argo might be not that far behind. So, I\u2019m curious what changed. And if you think those folks may be misguided in their assumption that they actually have a solution? And sort of the corollary to that is, are you going to take this capital, and it sounds like you are going to, and accelerate your EV and your connectivity efforts that will generate profits much more quickly in the near term? And how much profit opportunity are there, or is there, around these connected vehicles that you\u2019re seeing with Pro that might spill over into the consumer side? Jim Farley : Thank you, John. The decision we made to reallocate our capital is a strategic one. It\u2019s some combination of the margins we\u2019re starting to see on our software, like Ford Pro, that\u2019s really the first large shippable software. The usage patterns we\u2019re seeing in BlueCruise, how much people use it and how passionate they are, and that\u2019s before ICE off, the confidence we now have in delivering L2 -- Level 3; the access to public markets for Level 4 funding; the opaqueness, as John said, of the view to return capital, the invested capital in Level 4 and Level 5. And it\u2019s some combination of that and a few other factors. But the biggest factor is our growing confidence in our talent, both the Argo talent and the team at Ford that Doug is building. And I\u2019m sure in the investment conference that will be a big focus of his comments. It\u2019s that combination, more than are we behind or we ahead, that informed us of this decision. And I think it\u2019s one of the bigger moments for us as a leadership team. And we are so excited about the software we can ship to our vehicles. We see it in BlueCruise now. We see in a Ford Pro. And we see other software that we\u2019re in the midst of. And the other key enabler is our growing confidence in landing a fully software-updatable vehicle as we launch our second cycle EVs. John, maybe it\u2019s best for you to talk about the reallocation of capital. John Lawler : Yes. So, first off, we\u2019re not capital constrained. We\u2019re investing our $50 billion, and we\u2019re investing on top of that in connectivity and software. So, we ended the quarter with $32 billion of cash and $49 billion of liquidity. So, it\u2019s taking that investment and putting it towards a business where we think we will have a sizable return in the near term relative to one that\u2019s going to have a long arc. And that\u2019s the business decision behind it. So, I think we need to be very clear about that. We\u2019re going to invest in L2 and L3, and some of the savings that we have will go into that. John Murphy : If I could just maybe just follow up on that. I mean there\u2019s got to be a high level of confidence that you\u2019re not going to be left behind as autonomy may develop over time. So I mean, a skeptic would say you\u2019re throwing in the towel and you can\u2019t keep up. An optimist would say you actually have confidence that you\u2019ll be able to keep up and maybe surpass the competition over time. I mean, how would you couch it in that range? Jim Farley : Well, I think it\u2019s best, John, for us to hear from Doug. But before we do that, I want to emphasize that a winning L4 business is as much about the go-to-market investment of a consumer-facing service. And all the depots, all the HD mapping of all the ODs across this enormous geography, all the enormous fleet, and because it\u2019s still weather-constrained, you have to have a driven fleet to complement it. So, aside from the -- handicapping the technology, the enormous investment that will have to be made in the nontechnology pieces is a big factor in our thinking. And Doug, maybe you could talk about how we\u2019re -- because we\u2019re still very excited about Level 4, how you see it as a technologist on the technology portion? Doug Field : Sure, Jim. As you mentioned, this is going to be a really tough problem to solve. It\u2019s the toughest problem of our generation. And I don\u2019t think about it as capital constraints nearly as much as talent constraints. In the kind of projects that we are diving into at Ford and the kind of work that we\u2019re doing, the constraint really becomes how many of the world\u2019s best people can you get working on a problem. And that\u2019s really the decision, in many ways, that is driving what we\u2019re doing here at Argo is we are deeply passionate about the L3 mission. We have ideas of how it can work and how customers can interact with it that are really exciting, particularly when you add them to our next-generation EVs. So, this is the way we want to use that talent. And we think it\u2019s the most meaningful way for them to impact the world. Operator : Next question is from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Colin Langan : Just a follow-up on the Argo, just to be clear. I mean, did you look for acquirers for the business? I mean, obviously, rather than taking a big impairment. And maybe a follow-up a little bit. What is your kind of time line for Level 4 that you\u2019re looking at? I mean, do you think this is 20 years out at this point? I mean, I guess you had a comment with some sort of assessment before you made the decision. Jim Farley : Absolutely. As I mentioned, Colin, we looked at many variables, and one of them is access to public markets. We were very clear that the Argo journey would include access to public markets over the last year. And we feel like that\u2019s a lot more challenged. So yes, we looked at possible partnerships and funding. But it was 1 of maybe 10 factors that we looked at in making this decision. John, maybe -- why don\u2019t you hear your -- our discussion as a leadership team on the time frame? John Lawler : Yes. So Colin, when we looked at this, as Jim said, not only does it require the technology breakthroughs and the capital invested in the technology, but then in all the services and fleets, scaling across the country that would be required to get to a profitable business. We saw that five years plus the horizon being that far out before you could actually get to something that started to generate a meaningful business. And we see a much greater opportunity to impact more customers immediately with the L2, L3 technology and impact our business in a positive way in the more near-term time frame. So, that was part of the business discussion that we had with the team. Colin Langan : Got it. And if I just have a quick follow-up. In terms of the guidance change, you lowered guidance at the midpoint by $500 million. But you did indicate raw materials look like about a $2 billion worse headwind. You lowered forward credit, volume guidance came down. So any color on the offset to the headwinds that you outlined in the release? John Lawler : Yes. I think it\u2019s really two things. It\u2019s the mix that we can see, vehicle line mix coming out of the supply base and then sterling. The exposure we have, as you know, we\u2019re the largest commercial vehicle player in Europe from a brand standpoint, and we have a very strong presence in the UK. And so that currency change did hit us quite hard after the quarter closed. And so, when we look at that, one of the things that we\u2019ve done, Colin, that I\u2019ve done, is I spent a lot of time -- the team has -- the last couple of weeks, doing deep dive on-site reviews of the supply base. In fact, we\u2019re approaching a deep review of almost 300 of those suppliers. And what we\u2019re finding is that there\u2019s a number of non-chip suppliers that are struggling to ramp production as the chip crisis eases. And it\u2019s not easing tremendously, it\u2019s easing slightly. We\u2019re starting to see that. But then we\u2019re seeing issues in non-chip suppliers. It has to do with the tight labor market, but it also has to do refining with many of the suppliers during the COVID time frame had not invested in maintenance or in their facilities and tooling, and so they\u2019re not able to ramp as we expected. And that\u2019s hit us in the fourth quarter on mix versus what we had expected. And so, it\u2019s really the mix in the currency that\u2019s getting to us and brought us down to the low end of our range. Colin Langan : Okay. And the offset to that $2 billion in results, is that pricing and possible vehicle mix? Sorry. Jim Farley : Yes, pricing. Net pricing continues to remain strong. Exactly, pricing continues to remain strong. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : Are you able to dimension for us how much of the $1 billion of higher-than-expected supplier-related inflation costs incurred in 3Q actually relate to in-period expenses incurred by suppliers versus how much might represent a catch-up of prior period cost? To know that I think would help with understanding what portion of this headwind in 3Q that we should model as continuing into 2023 versus how much might be more onetime in nature? Jim Farley : Yes. So, one of the things that we\u2019re doing is, as we\u2019re taking settlements with the supply base, we\u2019re looking to do that more in a lump-sum fashion, so that it\u2019s not baked into the piece price. And we\u2019ll share more about what that means on a go-forward basis as we talk about \u201823 in Q4. So, what we\u2019ve provided for the year is it\u2019s $9 billion, up from $7 billion last quarter when we reported. The amount of $1 billion in the third quarter was part of the third quarter, but it was also a settlement for the first half as well. And it largely reflects a lot of ways, a confluence of factors that led to that. One of the things we are having better clarity around is schedule and stability. And combining that with labor shortages and our high complexity, that had a larger impact on the supply base\u2019s ability to deliver cost efficiencies this year and much higher than we expected, and quite frankly, higher than we were initially willing to accept. And so, we spent a lot of time with our supplier partners. And we came to the conclusion, and that included conversations all the way up with June with supplier CEOs. And our conclusion coming out of that was that it became evident that we needed to increase the settlement amount, support our supplier partners, and we made the call in the third quarter. And then, we told all of you as soon as we made that call. So that we got out in front of it and knew what we knew. Ryan Brinkman : Okay. Very helpful. And lastly, I think at the time of the 2Q call, you considered it a bit too early to say whether commodity costs are likely to be a tailwind or a headwind next year. But with the subsequent decline now in spot prices, are you more confident that commodities are likely to be a tailwind? And are you able to dimension at all that tailwind or maybe compare it directionally in magnitude to the headwinds that you\u2019re likely to face when it comes to non-commodity supply chain costs which do not seem to be deflating similar to commodities? Jim Farley : Yes. So, we are seeing the commodity spot prices come off a bit, but quite honestly, it\u2019s not meaningful enough at this point to make a significant impact. I think we\u2019re all trying to work through the macroeconomic environment how far are things going to slow down, how quickly will that drive easing of commodity prices? Will that also drive ease in the whole logistics chain? We know that logistic prices are up significantly. Ocean freight is up significantly. And so, right now, we\u2019re trying to make that call on 2023, with a quarter left to go, is a really difficult thing to do. So, we\u2019re going to hold off on doing any of that today. And we\u2019ll be able to talk about more of that with our Q4 earnings at the beginning of next year. Operator : The next question is from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : I wanted to just ask about vehicle pricing. Jim, you\u2019ve always had a pretty good read on seeing the market through the consumers\u2019 lens. And obviously, average transaction prices are up a lot, and now rates are going up, and trade-in values are starting to come off the peak. Can you maybe just give us your thoughts about affordability and this interplay between price and volume and inventory starts to normalize? It\u2019d be helpful if you had any thoughts on kind of the magnitude of price normalization that we might see over the next year or two? Jim Farley : Thank you, Rob. The early signs are coming in. It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s lumpy. The commercial vehicle and EV demand is through the roof. We\u2019ve seen literally no -- no change, if not an increase. And that includes commercial vehicles in Europe, which is interesting. Our order bank continues to grow. It\u2019s multi, multi month. We continue to have to close out order windows for our commercial vehicles because of the demand. Same for EVs, as we\u2019ve taken prices up. On the retail side in the U.S., what I see that\u2019s different from last quarter is slight uptick on 84-month customer financing, and Marion, if you want to go into that, that\u2019s fine. We\u2019re seeing, obviously, an easing of used cars, which makes trade-ins, and those transactions that include trade-ins a little more challenging for customers for higher payments. We\u2019re seeing -- the one that I watch the most is our turn rates for F-150. It\u2019s our highest volume vehicle. And we\u2019re starting to see some differences in turn rates between XLT and Lariat. It\u2019s small right now, but it\u2019s different. In the past, Lariat\u2019s turned faster than XLT, and that\u2019s reversed compared to the quarter. It\u2019s really subtle right now. So, what I\u2019d expect on pricing -- and you see some of our competitors come in with higher spending now on incentives. So, we\u2019ve already accounted for some of that, as John has said in the past. What I would be looking for and what I think is important to watch for is the mix changes. The mixes of series and specifications within a profitable nameplate, like Super Duty or F-150 or mix shifts, obviously, between models. Rod, our lineup is so fresh right now. It\u2019s very opaque for us. So, the only mix shift we\u2019re seeing is within spec. Marion, do you want to mention anything about payments? Marion Harris : Yes. We\u2019re seeing some customers extending terms for vehicle affordability trying to stay at the same payment level, but with higher transaction prices and higher interest rates, customers are going longer term. And we\u2019ve seen vehicle payment, even with that, move out quite a bit this year. And it\u2019s -- that\u2019s starting to have a bit of an effect. And it\u2019s in pockets around the country as well. So, many areas are still very, very strong. In other areas, you hear about deals not going through because of changes in payment quality. Rod Lache : Thanks for that. And maybe just switching gears, Marion, I\u2019m trying to understand your implicit guidance for Ford Credit. You brought the full year down a little bit, at least it optically looks that way from around $3 billion to $2.7 billion, but now Q4 looks like it\u2019s quite low. I was wondering if you might be able to give us some color on where you expect to end the year in terms of loss reserves. At one point, you had, I think, post-COVID, taken the reserves up to 1.2% of managed receivables. Is that sort of something that you\u2019re -- that\u2019s implicit in these numbers, or is there anything else in there that\u2019s driving that level of profitability? Marion Harris : Yes. Let me just give you the key takeaways here. First of all, our balance sheet is significantly smaller than it was a few years ago, right off the top. Second, we\u2019re no longer releasing COVID-related credit loss reserves. We\u2019re back at what we would consider normal reserve levels. Third, our lease depreciation tailwinds are mostly behind us, and we have lower used car values as we look forward. And fourth, our borrowing costs are higher, which we haven\u2019t been able to fully pass on to customers as rates have risen rapidly. That\u2019s something, though that over time, we do expect the balance sheet to grow, and we would expect some continued borrowing cost headwinds, but those will moderate and ease over time as the portfolio returns. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mark Delaney : So maybe you could share more on the timing to bring L3 products to market? And is that something you think Ford will be developing in-house perhaps with some benefit from Argo capabilities? I was just thinking something you perhaps leverage from some of the suppliers in some of their potential input or maybe some combination? Jim Farley : Thank you, Mark. I think, Doug, is best suited to answer this. All I would say is that we\u2019re timing the arrival in line with our second cycle of EVs and a fully updatable -- software-updatable vehicle. So kind of think of that \u201823 to \u201825 time frame is Ford completely refreshing its EV lineup globally, introducing fully updatable electrical architectures and in-house software development for controlling the vehicle, leveraging all of our experience of now we\u2019ve done 5 million OTAs and on enhanced Level 2+ and Level 3 system. Over to you, Doug. Doug Field : Thanks, Jim. We are not going to ignore the capabilities of suppliers that can provide value in our L3 solution. They are great manufacturers of components of systems, such as imaging sensors and radar, and we\u2019ll take advantage of that. But we will have a core team that can integrate a system, understand its performance at the system level, and we will own the software. It is really important that we also own the connection to these vehicles. L3 is a connected technology. So, the ability to have a pipeline that collects data and makes the system better and better, we must own that. Finally, the customer experience, how the customer moves in and out of autonomous operation, that\u2019s a problem that actually doesn\u2019t exist in L4 and is a huge opportunity for us to create a Ford experience that\u2019s really unique. So, those are the areas that we will absolutely develop great capability in-house and focus on in the L3 development. Jim Farley : And we\u2019re really excited about the Argo team helping us with that internal effort. Doug Field : Yes, we have just incredible talent. Mark Delaney : That\u2019s quite helpful. Thank you. And one more on EVs, if I could, please. You mentioned the myriad of ways that the IRA could potentially benefit Ford. And you reiterated the capacity ramp targets through 2026, I believe. But do you think over the longer term and perhaps out over the next 10 years or so, does the IRA change the gross amount of investment you want to make into EVs and how quickly Ford may shift toward EVs, especially in the latter part of this decade? Thanks. Jim Farley : It only accelerates what we\u2019re going to do, for sure. And what\u2019s exciting for us is being a 40% player in the U.S. and the top brand in Europe of commercial vehicles in the U.S. I mean, we never had this before. And to give you a sense of the EV tax credit for commercial, how evocative that is for Ford, the people who buy a police vehicle, so people who buy ambulances for communities, the emergency responders, they never had tax credits. They are going to have -- this is not just a $7,500 tax credit for consumers. This is for businesses, including local municipalities. So, I think this will have a dramatic impact on the adoption of EV, which we\u2019re already 90% market share in the e-van business. We think we\u2019ll really accelerate the demand for these commercial EVs, and that\u2019s only going to accelerate our speed to market and our scaling of those vehicles. We can\u2019t wait to show you the vehicles themselves because they\u2019re second-generation commercial EVs. So, this is going to accelerate. What\u2019s not clear yet, I said, is will the consumer demand side of this legislation be the largest benefit to our customers in the company, or it would be more like the industrialization of vehicles? That\u2019s something to play out in the marketplace. And it\u2019s hard to handicap that, honestly. Operator : The next question is from Joseph Spak with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Joseph Spak : Maybe, Jim, just picking up there on the IRA side, you mentioned the $7 billion between Ford and the partners. I believe that is sort of that full $45. Can we just drill down a little bit because it would seem to me like you should at least be able to get the 10 for the pack starting next year? And then, where are you in sort of negotiating maybe how much of that 35 you can get from some of your partners? And then, just on the commercial side, like, should we really think -- how should we think about, I guess, the mix of EVs next year between commercial and retail? Because it seems like it\u2019s, to your point, pretty skewed in one direction. Jim Farley : Yes. Well, I wish we could go into the commercial negotiation with our battery partners, but I\u2019m not going to go into it now. But you can imagine there\u2019s lots of interesting discussions going on right now between, because we\u2019re obviously in the middle -- I mean, some -- we\u2019ve already inked a deal on our DAs, others are still in the mix. So, I wish I could cover that with you right now, but I don\u2019t think that would be fair to our battery partners to go public with -- with how that\u2019s going to benefit both of us. But you can imagine. I mean, I just think of it, generally speaking, as proportional to our investments. On the commercial EV, I have to say, the demand for the move to electric on our commercial customers is, in many ways, more robust than the retail side, even though we\u2019re completely sold out in both, for the three products, the turn rates are just enormous, the order rates. But the profitability is different between a commercial EV and a retail EV. And we\u2019re going to be breaking out our EV business and profitability soon. So this is going to be quite interesting for all of you and for us as we do that. So -- but I will tell you, this is a big help. This will really help the profitability of our commercial vehicle that are EV. And I think it will really stimulate the demand. The tricky part for us is, operationally, what do we do between now and the end of the year. That\u2019s the tricky part for us operationally, is we have a lot of customers who are going to wait until next year to order a Lightning Pro or an E-Transit. But, I think for sure, this is just going to upset that equilibrium. We have to -- by the way, we have to -- we have this discussion inside the Company every day. How many Lighting Pros do we want to make and how many Lightning retail F-150 EVs do we want to make? So, it\u2019s already quite spirited discussion. But I think this will help our profitability quite a bit even next year, which you will see. And we\u2019re really excited about this change. I mean, having almost 65% of our customers qualify, including local municipalities, it\u2019s a game-changer for our demand. John, anything you want to divulge about the negotiations? John Lawler : Not about the negotiations. Thanks, Jim. Jim Farley : Okay. Joseph Spak : Maybe just -- Jim, you\u2019ve clearly shown since you\u2019ve -- since you\u2019ve been CEO that you\u2019ve been willing to adapt and change to new information and circumstances, like the Argo announcements today, I think, and the other example would be, I guess, the LFP strategy you talked about earlier this summer. But I guess that has even maybe potentially changed a little bit again since, I guess, geopolitically, the U.S. relationship with China might have turned south. So, any update on that? And is there a backup plan? Is there any risk to any of those time lines? Jim Farley : That is a very good question. So, obviously, we have this unique profile as a commercial company in EV, and we now have, I mean, literally all the commercial pickup truck business that\u2019s EV, and we\u2019re 90% plus on the van side. So, it\u2019s a very important question for us. And we also think for affordability, back to Rod\u2019s point, LFP is a very important technology, and all the IP is in China. So, this is a really dynamic situation. I think what you\u2019ll see is that the tariff rules of the importing LFP batteries into the U.S. is still very favorable, so. And we have a really great contract with a particular LFP supplier to incorporate those batteries next year. So, I think, we\u2019re in really good shape. The real billion-dollar question is when do you localize production of LFP in North America? And is that in the U.S. and Mexico? And where do you build the cells versus pack? And whose name is on the front of the building and all that. And we\u2019re not going to go into that. But I will tell you that just given the reality of the tariff structure, we can import LFP from China economically now.

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, Jason, and welcome to Ford Motor Company's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, our President and CEO; and John Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit. Today's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at, shareholder.ford.com. Today's discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 24. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is volume weighted. I want to call out a few near-term key IR engagements. On February 15, Jim Farley and John Lawler will participate in a fireside chat in New York with Rod Lash at the Wolf Global Auto, Autotech and Mobility Conference. On March 23, at the New York Stock Exchange, we will hold a teach-in about our new Ford+ segment reporting. This event featuring John Lawler and Kathy O'Callaghan, our Controller, will be webcast. And I'm also pleased to share that our next Capital Markets Day will be Monday, May 22, at our headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. Please save the date. We'll have more information about this over the coming weeks. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Farley : Thanks, Lynn, and hello, everyone. We appreciate you all joining us. I'll start by addressing the obvious. Our fourth quarter and full year financial performance last year fell short of our potential. And while we generated record cash flow, we left about $2 billion of profit on the table due to cost and especially continued supply chain issues. These are the simple facts and to say I'm frustrated as an understatement because the year could have been so much more for us at Ford. Now I know the question you must be asking, why Ford with that incredible product lineup, and all the restructuring overseas, why aren't you delivering higher profits and more competitive margins? And it's the right question. So [Technical Difficulty] while we're making progress, it's hard work. As with any transformation of this magnitude, certain parts are moving faster than I expected and other parts are taking longer. Now the first part of our transformation is to completely overhaul our industrial system. Product development, manufacturing and supply chain management to deliver better cost and quality, this is critical because it provides the foundation for everything else we do. It funds our future, that's second transformation, which we're aggressively building today. Building new and incredible new growth businesses like Model e and of course, Ford Pro are huge bet on commercial vehicles, which will be high growth, high margin, not just products but software and services business. Now the second transformation, the growth part is going better than I imagined. At this point in our journey, I did not expect to be number two in EV sales in the U.S. I didn't know that Lightning would be completely sold out. And I didn't predict that BlueCruise would be the best hands-free autonomy system in the market or the Ford Pro software sales would be growing off the charts. And that doesn't even touch all the incredible next-generation EVs and software platforms that will soon be entering the market. Bottom line, in a double transformation, we have to significantly improve our cost and our quality, but at the same time, grow to fulfill that huge promise in Ford+. And frankly, the first part of the transformation has not moved fast enough. Now this is what we should be known for. It's our legacy and will show we can do it again. We have deeply entrenched issues in our industrial system that have proven tough to root out. Candidly, the strength of our products and revenue has masked this functionality for a long time. It's not an excuse. But it's our reality, and we're dealing with it urgently. Over the past year, we have made sweeping leadership changes and brought in world-class talent to reenergize and rebuild a leading industrial organization. We've committed company-wide to implement a lean operating system that will scrub billions of dollars of waste out of our company. And we are shining the light on every inch of our legacy business with knowledge that we must do better every day. This has been humbling for both me and our team. That said, I've never been more convinced about our plan. I cannot wait to get into work every day because I'm so optimistic about our plan and what we are creating here at Ford. Now I respect our competition, but I would not trade our places with anyone. Why? Because we have a real strategy to grow. We have incredible products, both on the road and the ones you haven't seen in the pipeline. And I believe we now have a world-class leadership team, made up of new and existing talent ready to compete and win. These strengths will shine through. Ultimately, the proof will be in our results. That's exactly how it should be. We appreciate those who place their faith in Ford, and we are committed to creating value for all of our stakeholders. So with that, let me quickly cover some areas of focus. First, we remain committed to disciplined capital allocation saw this in the actions we took in Brazil and India and most recently in Argo. And now South America and IMG are healthy and generating sustainable profits. This work is never done and will continue to be the focus for us going forward. Our balance sheet, liquidity remains strong and our ability to generate free cash flow has really improved significantly. And this is allowing us to accelerate our investment in growth, of course, electrification, but also Pro and software, while importantly, also returning capital to our shareholders. And we now have created three distinct customer-facing business segments : Blue, e and Pro, which have given us greater clarity and insights into each of these businesses and how we can improve each of them uniquely. So let me cover a couple of highlights. I'm going to start with Pro, my favorite, the not-so-secret weapon at Ford. Ford Pro embodies all of our growth levers, and it capitalizes on our commercial vehicle sales leadership and scale to build a world-class ecosystem that delivers great value to our customers and profitable growth for us at Ford. In North America, our vehicle share is almost twice that of our closest competitor. And in Europe, Ford has been the number one vehicle brand -- commercial vehicle brand for eight years in a row. Let me bring this point home. Here in North America, whole market, Super Duty, our most important Pro vehicle, owns half the mining business. It owns half the emergency response business and have the utility business. And the requirements for all these customers are complex. They're not going to commoditize and they require a partner who deeply understands these unique businesses and is dedicated to providing a mix of vehicles, but also services that can improve uptime and total cost of ownership. And we know these customers will pay for software that will enhance their productivity. Now we're going to future-proof this business by leading the commercial electrification solutions as well, both at E-Transit and F-150 Lightning today. E-Transit is already America's top-selling electric van with 73% market share, 60% of all of our U.S. fleet managers plan to add an electric vehicle within the next two years to their fleet. And that's even before the $7,500 IRA tax credit that was announced and applies irregardless of the location of raw materials of batteries. This year, Pro really gets going. We introduced our most important vehicle gets refreshed, the new Super Duty Pickup. And in Europe, the Super Duty equivalent, we have an all-new 1-ton Transit. And Ford Pro's high-margin software business will continue to grow, especially software for fleet management, telematics and charging. Last year, these subscriptions for software grew over 70%, reflecting new software offerings, better platform for our software and contracts and growth in fleet charging attach rates, which are close to 50% now. We're also increasing our sales of parts and services via network of 1,000 mobile service vehicles on the road in North America and Europe and over 1,400 specialized commercial vehicle dealerships, many of which opened 24/7. In fact, last year, mobile service repair orders increased 85% for us in Pro. And this improves the customer experience while importantly increasing the attach rates of our high-margin parts business. Now moving to Blue. The team is focused and has delivered the freshest and most appealing product lineup in our industry. We know that typically the fresher the ICE portfolio, the greater the pricing power. So, our decision to move away from and commoditized utilities to vehicles like Bronco Sport and the Big Bronco, the Maverick, the Puma in Europe and hybrid powertrains has really paid off. Ford gained nearly one point of market share here in the U.S. last year. And we expect 2023 to be another big, strong year of share growth. Ford Blue is a growth business for the foreseeable future with strong profits and robust free cash flow. An F-Series was America's best-selling truck for 46 consecutive year now, outselling its second-place competitor by more than 140,000 trucks. We're launching even new pickups like the new Ranger here in North America and in South America after we've already launched the new Ranger in Asia and Europe last year. In addition, Blue is going after billions of cost improvements from engineering to manufacturing to our bill of material. And in quality, we have work to do. Ford has been the number one in recalls in the U.S. for the last two years. Clearly, that's not acceptable. We've overhauled our entire enterprise quality operating system. And we are already seeing improvements in initial quality for vehicles coming out of our plants here in North America. And Model e. It's operating with a start-up intensity to build profitable EVs with differentiated industry-leading portfolios that customers are going to love. In the U.S., our EV sales growth is twice the rate of the EV segment and more than 60% of our Model e customers are new to Ford. The F-150 Lightning has been America's best- selling electric pickup since it launched. And the Mustang Mach-E remains a huge hit for our customers. We remain on track to reach our annualized EV production capacity of 50,000 units per month or 600,000 units globally by the end of this year. For reference, in the fourth quarter, our run rate of production was more like 12,000. So 50,000 is a big growth. And by the end of -- and we are on plan for that 2 million units of incremental capacity by the end of 2026. Now to deliver this incredible growth, as we speak, through our facilities in North America, we're adding shifts, expanding our facilities, building out battery capacity and assembly capacity. Construction is in full swing in Tennessee and Kentucky on our BlueOval City and our three BlueOval SK battery plants. And in Europe, we're moving ahead with a new commercial vehicle battery facility in Turkey. Now critical to our plan is securing the necessary raw materials for these batteries to get to that 2 million unit rate, especially lithium and lithium hydroxide and nickel. We expect to have 100% of raw materials we need for the 2 million unit run rate secured by the end of this year. Now we are deep in the development of our second- generation EVs, including our next-generation electric full-size pickup, which, by the way, is awesome. These EVs will be fully software-updatable. That means a brand-new electric architecture, and they're going to be radically simplified. Imagine three body styles, each with volume potential of up to 1 million units and just a handful of orderable combinations. That's what we're doing at Ford for the second generation of products. And that means higher customer sat, better quality, lower bill material and lower manufacturing costs. When are when we start reporting according to these new segments in the fourth quarter, you're going to have complete visibility in the Model e's margin trajectory and understand the key levers to achieve our Model EBIT target of 8%. We're already making the customer buying experience better with less friction. Now this is only going to accelerate when the new Model e dealer program takes effect in January next year. This program has been adopted by nearly 2/3 of our 3,000 U.S. dealers, and it's based on a radical redesign on our customer experience. Next January, we'll be selling EVs at high volume with virtually no inventory, a simple e-commerce platform for our customers, non-negotiated price set by the local dealer and remote pickup and delivery for all customer experiences. We're also expanding BlueOval charging network at all of our dealers and we'll have dealer staff trained not only on software but all the EVs. Now I've said before, software and experiences will be the key differentiator for our industry. I mentioned earlier that BlueCruise, our driver assist hands-free technology, was just tested by consumer ports and judge the best hands-free autonomous system on the market. Let that sink in for a while, the best on the market. Now have you not experienced BlueCruise, I challenge you to go out and do your side-by-side comparison with our two major competitors. And at the end of last year, our customers using BlueCruise have now traveled 42 million hands-free miles. So we're scaling incredibly rapidly. That's a fourfold increase in the millions of miles since the second quarter of last year. And we have incredible software talent, making this system better every day, including those 600 former Argo engineers who are now working full time at Ford on our autonomous systems. Now before I hand it over to John, just a few things. Ford is a different company today. We're all about building a stronger customer-focused business that generates sustainable profitable growth and returns above the cost of capital. While our 2022 results fell short of my expectations, I've never been more excited about our future because we have the right plan, the right structure to succeed, the best team on the field and real strategic clarity. This year is about execution. It's time for us to deliver, and we will with relentless attention to our founding principles, drift and growth, and we are hitting the ground running. John? John Lawler : Thanks, Jim. As Jim pointed out, our performance in 2022 was below our expectations, and our industrial platform is frankly not where we need it to be. The simple way I measure this is by looking at our cost of goods sold as a percent of revenue and then compare it to our competition. You've all done it. We're much higher. And this speaks to the significant operating deficits we have in product development, manufacturing and procurement. And this is no different from the tough capital allocation choices we made on our geographic footprint and product portfolio. Choice is designed to yield higher quality growth and improved returns. And we are now applying that same level of discipline to our industrial platform with urgency. Now on the positive side, our product portfolio has never been stronger. Our new vehicles are a hit with our customers. Our iconic vehicles remain market leaders, and we continue to make strategic and capital allocation decisions to drive growth, strengthen our competitive position and produce returns above our cost of capital. So turning to the year. We generated a record $9.1 billion in free cash flow, well above our cash conversion target of 50% to 60%. And importantly, most of the free cash flow came from the Automotive business, and this reflects more disciplined capital allocation, including the restructuring of our operations outside of North America, which until recently was a significant source of cash burn. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the year with $32 billion of cash and $48 million of liquidity. This, coupled with the improvement in free cash flow, provides us with ample flexibility to both fund our growth and return capital to our shareholders. In fact, today, we declared our first quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share as well as a supplemental dividend of $0.65 per share, reflecting our strong free cash flow and the monetization of our Rivian stake, which is now nearly complete. Going forward, we intend to target distribution of 40% to 50% of free cash flow, consistent with our focus on total shareholder return. Now for the year, we delivered $10.4 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 6.6%. And as Jim said, by better executing the things we control, we should have generated as much as $2 more in adjusted EBIT. For example, the instability of our supply chain and production plans caused us to not only deliver lower- than-planned volumes in the fourth quarter but also incur higher costs through premium freight and other supplier charges. Now let me give you a quick overview of how our '22 segments performed recognizing that beginning with our first quarter 2023 results will no longer have the automotive segments with regional breakouts. Now North America delivered $9.2 billion of EBIT, an improvement of $1.8 billion, driven by higher net pricing and increased volume, which was partially offset by higher commodities and other inflation-related cost increases. EBIT margin was 8.4%. We continue to maintain a healthy order bank, and the team is busy preparing the launch of the all-new Super Duty and our seventh generation Mustang later this year, and both of those are incredible products. In South America, we delivered a profit of over $400 million, and the region is now derisked and sustainably profitable. In Europe, we were slightly above breakeven for the year, but as our fourth quarter results showed clearly below our target. Given the changing macroeconomic environment and demand environment in Europe, we will make the changes necessary to deliver a sustainable business that consistently generates returns above our cost of capital. Our core strength in the region continues to be our leading commercial vehicle business. In China, we posted a loss of about $600 million, driven by increased investment in EVs. Lincoln continues to be our profit pillar in the region, but clearly, we have more work to do to ensure our business is growing sustainable and delivering appropriate returns. Our International Markets Group earned more than $600 million, driven by the launch of the Ranger and our decision to exit India. And similar to South America, the region is now primed for sustainable profitability. And finally, Ford Credit had another solid year, delivering EBT of $2.7 billion, which was down $2.1 billion from the prior year, reflecting lower credit loss and lease residual reserve releases, lower financing margin and lower lease return rates. Now given the continued uncertainties in the macro environment, I want to provide some context to how we're thinking about 2023. For the full year, we expect to earn $9 billion to $11 billion in adjusted EBIT, and that assumes a SAR of 15 million units in the U.S. and 13 million units in Europe. We expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of about $6 billion and for capital expenditures to be between $8 billion to $9 billion. Our adjusted EBIT guidance includes various headwinds and tailwinds and that we believe could impact our business in the coming year. And for example, when you think about the headwinds, they include an expected mild recession in the U.S. in moderate recession in Europe, higher industry incentives as supply and demand come back into balance. Ford Credit EBT of about $1.3 billion, and that's about $1.4 billion lower than in 2022, reflecting unfavorable lease residual and credit losses and the nonreoccurrence of derivative games. We expect a continued strong dollar. We also expect about $2 billion lower past service pension income. And we're also going to continue investments in growth, including in customer experience, connected services and CapEx as we build out our growth plan. Now tailwinds include improvements in supply chain and industry volume, launch of our all-new Super Duty and then, of course, lower cost of goods sold, including efficiencies in materials, commodities, logistics and other parts of our industrial platform. Now before taking questions, let me briefly touch on our new financial reporting as well as plans for our next Capital Markets Day. On March 23, we'll hold a teach-in at the New York Stock Exchange. And I'm really excited about this opportunity because it will be our chance to take you through how the new Ford+ segments will alter our financial reporting. The changes will include how revenue, cost products and assets are assigned to each segment. At the teaching, we'll also share our recast financials for both 2021 and 2022, and we hope many of you join us at the New York Stock Exchange in person. But we will also broadcast a webcast live, and will be -- and will post a toolkit and other materials to orient you around all the materials and help you migrate your models. Now the teaching will not be a strategic update. That will come at our Capital Markets Day in Dearborn in May, when we'll update you on our Ford+ strategy. We'll do a deep dive into financial targets and KPIs for each of our new segments as well as for software and services. Now with this new level of transparency, which will be tracked and validated in our earnings materials and SEC filings, we think investors will be better equipped to value how each of our customer-focused segments is contributing to Ford's overall growth and return profile. And as Jim mentioned earlier, 2023 is a pivotal year for Ford. We have the plan, the talent and the product portfolio in place to take the Company to an exciting new level, one that is both differentiated from our past performance and our competitors. And going forward, our new segmentation will provide unprecedented levels of transparency and insight into all aspects of our business, making it easier to hold Ford leadership accountable for delivering superior growth and value for all of our stakeholders. Now that wraps up the prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your mind. So thank you. And operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Jonas : I appreciate the humility and the self-criticism and the spirit of that on the cost and the execution shortfall. It's kind of refreshing to see that. But when you begin the description about it and how frustrated you are, Jim, and how it's not good enough, I was getting all excited to hear some details and there's just not a lot here, okay? I'm just going to say, it's not a lot of details at all about what exactly the problem is and what you're doing about it and how much and get better this year? You can disagree if you want, that is my impression. I want to know what it is and because $2 billion on the table, frankly, that's 130 bps of margin. I mean that's going to go to the consumer anyway. So tell us that's just the beginning, and there's way more to go. Do we have to wait until May for that? Or is there anything else you can tell us to help model the Company in the year ahead and what you're doing about it? Appreciate it. Jim Farley : No, there is a lot more to go. And the industrial system at Ford is a huge opportunity for us. And we have spent the last several months really getting deep on where we need to go. So John, maybe you could share or feeling comfortable on sharing, but you're going to hear a drumbeat from Ford on this all during the year. John Lawler : Yes. So Adam, I think if you just step back and look at the three elements of the industrial platform, there's opportunities across each. If you look at our product development system and in our engineering, the level of productivity that we have, so think about $1 of input and what you get out for that $1 of input is probably about 25% to 30% inefficient. So, we should be either getting more products through the pipeline or our cost should be significantly lower. Now we have to be very smart about how we go about doing that because we've got incredible products in the pipeline, and there's a huge opportunity on that front, but we also have to balance the quality as well. And so, when it comes to our engineering, I think you should think about it that way, and that's what we're going after. Our supply chain, there are issues across the supply chain. It cost us, as we talked about last year, at least $1 billion in premiums that we had to pay, increased freight premiums on chips, premiums on disruption that we called our suppliers because our schedule stability was probably worst in class and fixing that and the root cause it gets to that will drive incredible opportunities for us. And let's say that for 2023, it should be at least an incremental $1 billion at least. And then when you look at our manufacturing system and you go through our plants, you look at the level of working capital we have in, you look at our production schedules, you look at the complexity and what it does for time that takes us to build a vehicle. And you understand just how inefficient that is. And then you bring that back through that -- complexity back through the supply chain, and you talked about the number of changeovers that our suppliers have to make to produce the complexity that we have and the time that, that adds to production and the time that it adds the cost and the issues that it drives through. So those are just some of the tip of the iceberg or the things we're going after. And then if you go back and you look at it, as I said in my remarks, just you look at the math and you look at our cost of goods sold relative to our revenue and then compare that to traditional OEMs, let alone the new OEMs, and you see the size of the prize that we're going after. And what's changed, Adam, I think the answer is, is we just have to show you guys. I mean that's where we're at. We have to deliver it. But as Jim said, as we're taking this lean approach and getting into it, there's a very systematic way we're going at it now, and we are very focused. And we know that this is the number one thing that needs to get fixed in the first part of our transformation. Jim Farley : And Adam, I'd just like to add as the CEO, there's a lot of choices, they're all very consequential when it comes to the approach to do this. The most important thing for me is sustainable. When you look at Ford, we have cut in the past and it grows back or we have cut everywhere and not really focused on the industrial system. So for me, the approach that we're taking that's very different and very difficult is that it has to be daily work, gaps to competition, countermeasures, action plans for those countermeasures, constant evaluation of the effectiveness of those countermeasures, celebration of those KPIs and our status and daily management. It has to be a more fundamental approach than holding our breath or dealing with the output like people and getting into the real industrial systems efficiency. And that is a cultural change as a leader. It's a behavioral change. It is not just a program. Operator : Our next question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Just kind of wanted to follow up sort of on a similar vein, short term and long term. Just for short term, when we think about the '23 outlook and you look at the $1 billion for decline in Ford Credit and take that as a reasonably given number, something in that direction and then $2 billion of lower past service pension income. That's a $3.4 billion headwind. But sort of at the midpoint of the range, you're talking about EBIT being roughly flat. So that sort of indicates a very significant $3 billion plus improvement in the core business, which is a lot to kind of believe when you're looking at sort of the headwinds and the issues that you just faced. I'm just curious if you can comment on that, maybe kind of walk us to how we get comfortable like we'll see a $3 billion plus improvement in the core business this year? I mean -- and how do you get these supply chain issues fixed when some of that are a bit outside of your control and what we hear from suppliers is volatility and schedules and it's not just specific to Ford, still pretty volatile? John Lawler : Yes. Thanks, John. It's a great question. That's exactly it. The headwinds are $4.5 billion to $5 billion, as we pointed out. And we said we expect on the tailwinds pricing to be about neutral. The market forces, I think, are going to drive average transaction prices down. We think probably around 5%. And that will come some from the dealer margins, but also from higher incentives. And then you step back from it, and we do have the new Super Duty, and we expect that to be a positive and we also have a very strong order bank on our commercial vehicles. So we're looking at pricing being about flattish we said volumes, there's a slight opportunity as industry comes along. So the rest of it falls into cost reductions, and that's exactly right. When you look at those cost reductions, you have to see what's happening relative to the material. And in, there's two phases there. There's one, it's -- we do expect commodity prices to come off a bit to improve a bit, but we also have significant opportunities in our material cost, and we have several initiatives going on to identify those efficiencies. We also have quite a bit of cost when you talk about schedule stability. I don't have the exact data from the competition. But when I look at our scheduled stability, there are significant opportunities through changes that we can take to improve that schedule stability, which will flow straight through to lower surcharges from the supply base because they have to deal with that instability and there's cost that drives as well as the significant premiums we paid in freight for expedite, air freight, et cetera, to just try to keep plants going and keep our suppliers' plans going. So, those are two immediate actions that we can take based on the inefficiencies we saw in '22 that cost us the $2 billion. And then on top of that, we have to build through the core industrial platform just productivity and efficiencies to drive even more improvement. So that's how we're thinking about it, and that's how we're going about it. John Murphy : Okay. That's actually incredibly helpful. And just on the long term, I mean you mentioned, Jim, about scrubbing things foundationally and really getting to some costs there excess, and I appreciate the three areas you've highlighted. But as we look around the world, I mean, Europe is -- had fits and starts of making us all kind of excited that it's going to work and then it doesn't from time to time. And China, you kind of been chasing competition there, and it hasn't really paid out for you. But there are two very important parts of Europe and China that are very strong for you. Commercial vehicle in Europe is incredibly strong. So could we just strip Europe back to pure commercial vehicle and could China just strip back to pure Lincoln? Two places we know you're making money and cut out the other stuff so that you can actually fund the transition that you're talking about? I mean, just -- we kind of all dance around this stuff and you've headed in this direction with the global redesign, but there's real opportunities here to be really profitable. Jim Farley : No, you hit on it. And I'm glad we're getting into some of the strategies. I mean I would think of China business similar to what we've done in South America and IMG. Small but profitable, focused. We've been in the past in China kind of small but focused on everything. And Lincoln and our commercial with JMC is very profitable and an important business, but they have to make the EV transition. And I don't think you can be globally successful in the EV business if you don't compete with the Chinese. I mean they're going to come to Europe -- they're already there. They're going to come to the U.S. a powerhouse. Geely, there's so many others. And so we believe China is very strategically important for us. But to win there, we have to make those businesses transition profitably to EV, but I would think of it as kind of small and focused, maybe even more than past. And Europe is definitely -- we have a great CV business, commercial vehicle business that now is getting electrified. So we're like making that transition now. We have a new Ranger, the electric version of one-ton. Transit, and all of them, we have a new manufacturing site in Romania that's really scaling up now in commercial. So we have a really strong business. And the decision really is how much do we need how much -- how many engineers, how many people do we need in Europe and how big of a profile do we need in passenger cars? That's the decision. We've already electrified Cologne and that's really the decision. It's not the right time to talk about where we're going to go, but we know exactly our strength in Europe, and we know what we need to do. So -- and you won't have to wait long to hear from us on these things. Operator : The next question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : I think, John, you said in response to Adam's question that variable costs would come down by at least $1 billion. But at the same time, you're acknowledging that pricing could easily be more than $1 billion negative for $100 billion North American business with 5 points of average transaction price decline. Can you maybe give us a little bit more insight into that? And can you provide a few specific KPIs that would demonstrate progress on structural costs they were up another $2 billion in 2022? John Lawler : Yes. So on the pricing, we do see the broad market coming in at about transaction prices falling about 5%. Some of that's going to come out of the dealer margins, of course. It's not all going to come from us. But we also have upside, Rod, with some of the launch of the new vehicles. We won't see as much of a price compression there. So, we see pricing net-net for us next year being about flattish. And so don't think about it as we're working through '23 as being a negative $1 billion. And then I would say that when it comes to the cost reductions, I think what we've got to start showing is, one, that we're getting leverage out of the business if we're growing the business that our cost of goods sold is growing at a much slower pace. And that as we're coming out with new vehicles, our cost per units are coming down, so our margins are improving. When you look at the design of our vehicles and you compare it to competition, I think if you go through those benchmarks and you go through those teardowns, you can see that there's a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to design out complexity. And you should see that coming through complexity reduction KPIs on our vehicles. I think that will be key. And it not only will be in the order combinations but also in the parts complexity in the number of parts. And what we'll be doing is as we move forward through this year, especially at Capital Markets Day, we'll be providing more details on those KPIs. But it's the key areas you should be seeing how much productivity we're getting out of $1 of engineering, and we should do something around that from a KPI standpoint because these are the areas that we need to improve. Jim Farley : Rod, some of the things I think about -- some of the things I think about is a number of complex sequencing centers we have. Our line sight complexity, number of parts sitting on side of the line, our inventory turns inside the plant. And on the supplier side, it's going to be transparency. We had full transparency down to Tier 3 in our supply chain. It's very important to operationalize better quality and cost. On the engineering side, it's also indirect. What's the ratio of indirect to direct engineering that we're spending, i.e., the productive engineering that's resulting in customer-facing products. And increasingly, I know it's going to sound a little bit weird, but it's the software output. We are spending as a management team more and more time on our software platform, and the cost of creating software and the complexity of software. And that's something that -- we have a lot of KPIs. They're increasing quickly and are increasingly important for us. It may not be significant for structural cost, but we have to be careful to add a lot of complexity in software. Rod Lache : So just to put a landmark out there, do you think a year from now will be looking at structural costs that are up or down, obviously, ex-pension because you have this $3 billion cost reduction plan? And then I have a second question just on Model e. John Lawler : Rod, I think it's beyond just structural cost. Our biggest cost element is our material cost. We will continue to invest in our growth-related investments, some connected services. The software, as Jim talked about, we're also continuing to invest, as you know, in our build-out of our batteries. So our spending related costs are going to go up. Volume will drive manufacturing cost, which is in our structural cost. So there will be puts and takes on the structural costs. Our biggest opportunity is in our level of material cost that we have. It's the largest cost element on our income statement, and it's where we are most uncompetitive. Rod Lache : Yes. Okay... John Lawler : So, we're going after everything, but I... Rod Lache : Yes. I think I got the answer on that. Maybe just to switch gears on Model e, if I can ask Jim a question, you've got this target of 8%. And that 8% margin target presumably has some assumptions for where costs will go, but also where pricing is going to go. And just considering everyone's aspirations for growth in EVs, do you think you can stand by those pricing assumptions and maybe a different way of asking this is, do you think you can sell a $40,000 electric crossover with a 20% gross margin? Jim Farley : That is a very important question. The reality is we will -- we are structuring our portfolio to compete in very specific segments. The crossover is turning out to be the core civic of the EV business. And the last thing we want to do is commoditize our products by dropping the price. Just look what happened to Henry Ford in the 20s in the early teens. And that's exactly what we're seeing play out here. We didn't have to touch the pricing in offer Lightning and E-Transit because we pick the right segments. But the real driver of our future profitability on Model e is the second cycle products. We didn't know when we designed these first three products. We didn't know that our wiring harness for Mach-E was 1.6 kilometers longer than it needed to be. We didn't know it's 70 pounds heavier and that that's worth $300 a battery. We didn't know that we underinvested in braking technology to save on the battery size. We didn't know that we needed the world's best aerodynamics to get the size of the battery smaller. And so now we have learned a lot and that second cycle of the product is in the factory right now being developed with a lot of new talent. So I'm very optimistic about our 8% because we are not going to be playing in the two-row commodity SUV market because that's -- because tried that in the ICE business, didn't really work out for us. We want to play our hand, our strength, commercial, truck, larger vehicles on the category side. We do not want to have too many top ads because that costs a lot to engineer. We want to have minimum choice for customers, but we want to design the smallest possible battery for competitive size, and we want to invest differently in our ICE business for radical simplification, 30%, 40%, 50% less fasteners, no brackets in the vehicle. I can go on and on. We'll get into it at Capital Markets Day. I think we should expect all brands to protect growth when it comes to EV. And that for we have to expect negative pricing. And that means software and other items like that becoming even more critical. I can't wait to show you our new electric architecture. To me, that's the most critical strategic investment the Company is making, not our batteries, not the EV platforms, but our new fully updatable electric architecture because what we've learned on Pro is we can make real money on software. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : Maybe to follow up on that. I heard you say in the prepared remarks that revenue for software services and charging rows 70% year-over-year in 2022. I remember you discussing like a potential $20 billion market opportunity by 2030 with a lot of exciting on Pro at the last Investor Day target for 33 million connected vehicles in 2028. But have you dimensioned how large or profitable this business may be currently? Or are you able to share any more interim goals such as what your expectations are for services revenue or services revenue growth in 2023? Or what the next catalyst might be here for this business, such as I don't know, the number of vehicles launching with Blue intelligence or anything else we should be monitoring? Jim Farley : Right. Yes, great question. We're going to see that on Pro first, and this year is a breakout year for Pro because we have brand-new products, both core in Europe and U.S. are most -- the highest volume, highest profit vehicles are all new. So, a very important year for us, I would say we absolutely have a fantastic business plan that's very specific about software and physical services. The biggest opportunity for us in the short term is the after sales business. Only 10% of our Pro customers do business with us, and we hardly do any financing with them. And so between financing and parts and service, we have enormous upside in the short term. And those are very profitable parts of our business. So I would think of it this way, Ryan. It's like software is starting to drive a closed loop where the customer wants to do more physical service with us. We have all those mobile units, more and more dedicated dealers and more of our commercial customers because of the use of the software is coming back and buying parts for us. And then the next level of performance is really going to be prognostics. When we could put predictive failure in all the vehicles, like you see on John Deere and Caterpillar, and then drive that into our physical repair facilities, we're going to see a much larger retention in parts and service. So I think the basics of the business are, these are profitable vehicles. We've got new ones coming out. We're going to grow that. We're -- I mean, we blew through our parts and service profits and revenue for Pro last year. It's almost like we can't even predict as this -- that software starts to really drive a different behavior for our customers, the growth in parts and service. But that's the monetization in the short term for these services in the integrated ecosystem. And then long term, the real game changer kind of like autonomy in the retail space is going to be that prognostics. Operator : Our next question comes from James Picariello from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. James Picariello : So the third quarter negative pre-announcement had a narrative around it, right? It was very high mix on wheels inventory that you couldn't ship and the additional $1 billion of supplier costs. I know Adam hit on this in his question, but this quarter is missing that storyline. I know it was mentioned that you have line of sight to $2 billion in profit that you left on the table. But what could really turn around almost immediately in this first quarter in '23 here in terms of like what operational mishaps you know will reverse in the coming months and quarter, whatever the time frame might be? John Lawler : Yes. I think it comes down to the key driver for the in the fourth quarter was the volumes. And the volumes was on availability of key commodities, primarily chips and the fact that many of our suppliers had equipment issues as they were ramping. We think we've worked through a lot of those issues on the ramp in our supply chain. And as far as the rate inflow on the commodities, the chips, it continues to be hand-to-hand comment. But we're putting corrective actions in place. We've got better pipelines from brokers and spot buys, and we're working very closely with our supply chain down to the Tier 2 chip suppliers. So that's execution, it changes that we're putting in place on the rate and flow, and it's being more efficient in our scheduling and the stability of our production to reduce expedited freight, expedited costs at our supply chain, et cetera. So, part of it's operational. Part of it's what we're doing working with our supply chain partners. And part of it is getting through the hump on ramping up run rates, et cetera, throughout the system. James Picariello : Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then in terms of the earnings bridge for this year, with respect to materials and freight, that $9 billion headwind in '22. I know you mentioned you're baking in commodity prices to come down. But all in relative to that $9 billion this past year, what's assumed in the '23 guide here on this line item? John Lawler : Right. So if you look at that, it's at least $2.5 billion depending on where we fall within the range of the guidance. So I think that would be a start point, and then we would go from there. And of course, we're going to be working to do better than that. But that's what we see so far. James Picariello : At least $2.5 billion positive. John Lawler : Yes. Operator : Our last question comes from Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please go ahead. Itay Michaeli : Just two questions for me. First, I was hoping you could maybe talk about the regional outlook in your 2023 guidance. I don't know that the segments are about to change but hoping we touch on the regions. And then second, maybe for Jim. When we're thinking about the software opportunity on your new electrical architecture on the consumer side of the business, where do you see the biggest opportunity there from a revenue perspective? Is it automated driving? Is it connected services? Just curious what is most interesting there? John Lawler : Yes. So I think what we would have to say is that given that we're moving to our segments for 2023, we're not going to be reporting the regions. And so we will give more color on 2023 by each of the business unit segments. And so I'm not going to comment on regions anymore going forward, unless there's a specific reason to do that within one of the segments. Jim Farley : I think on the demand side, we see the U.S. around the $15 million range, Europe around $13 million. We're going to see more incentives in the U.S. So we can go through the demand side if that's what you're interested in. Itay Michaeli : Yes, sure. That would be helpful. Yes. Maybe pricing in Europe would be helpful as well. John Lawler : Yes. I think in Europe, we're going to see continued pressure on the top line. We've got a 13 million unit in the industry. We think we still have such a strong order bank. We not think we know we have a strong order bank on our commercial vehicles that we don't see as much pressure there. More of the pressure will come on the passenger side. But pricing in Europe, incentives continue to be strong throughout this year. So I don't think you'll see as much price compression in Europe, as you've seen in -- you'll see in North America and the U.S. But I think definitely for Europe, it's the call on the industry and where do we think that will be offset by the strength of the order bank we have on our commercial vehicles. Coming back to the U.S., as we said, a 15 million unit industry, we think prices are going to come and the industry are going to fall, transaction prices will fall about 5%. You think about that as about a combination of incentives and lower dealer margins. We're starting to see dealer margins come down now as our demand from the industry is easing a bit. And we're starting to see the inflationary costs come through with the pricing. And so we're starting to see those margins come off. And I think through as we go through the year, particularly in the second half, you'll start to see prices come down through higher incentives by the OEMs. When you look at our International Markets Group, I think it's a little bit different there. Our key product is Ranger, and that's all new, and that's launching, and so there's incredible demand for it. And so we think we have some pricing power there as well. So I think the puts and takes around the region, if you look at it on a macro basis. And I think it will be more insightful as we talk about what's happening in each of the segments and then specifically what's happening in Pro Blue and e in those segments around the world. John Lawler : On the software side, we were guessing before, but now we kind of know what the first three shippable large TAM software revenue sources are for our industry. The first is partial autonomy, the second is safety and security and the third is productivity. And the star people in there, the early leaders definitely ADAS on pricing revenue growth. I mean, the growth we're seeing, the demand we're seeing for BlueCruise and all ADAS features is really driving a lot of software shipment. We're about to ship our second cycle of BlueCruise already, and we are really starting to see -- that is clearly what customers want revenue-wise. And I do believe in this first three, four years of software to the car that ADAS, that Level 2, Level 3 system, is really the most remarkable TAM. However, in the background, for Ford, the productivity software in Pro is really important. It's maybe unique to us, but it is a very important part of our software revenue, which we will lay out in May. You'll see more specifics on it, but it's very profitable. The customers love the data, and they have a higher demand for the data and the software than the retail customer. I think the slow burn, the one in the background that I'm super excited about is the third leg of the stool of safety and security, not like someone stole your car, but it's video content, a lot of it tied to insurance. So this is going to be a really interesting area. Kind of think of your cars and extension of your ring and all the safety and security you have in your house now, all that technology, the cars give me another note on that. It will go for everything from teenage drivers to all sorts of things and that video capture is going to be the essence. Another reason why we think our next electrical architecture is so strategically important for the Company because we want to embed that hardware and software and adaptability in the electric architecture so we can ship the software, better software than our competition on safety and security, even if it's a little fuzzy on what the features are today.

You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on page 25. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is volume weighted. Want to make sure you've got a few near-term IR engagements on your calendars on May 21st and 22nd, we'll host our Capital Markets event in Dearborn, Michigan. For the first time in over seven years, we're looking forward to welcoming representatives of the capital markets to our headquarters. The event will feature unprecedented experiences, including one of the largest displays of our global vehicle portfolio in recent memory and immersive presentations on the strategic plans of our three new customer-centered business segments. We will also feature details of our software and services strategy, both retail and commercial, as well as ample time to network with our senior leaders. On May 25th, Jim Farley will keynote at Morgan Stanley Sustainability Conference in New York City. And on May 31st, Jim will participate in a fireside chat with Tony Saganaki at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference, also in New York City. Now I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Farley : Thank you, Lynn. And hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'd bottom line the first quarter like this. Our team delivered a solid quarter while making real progress on our Ford+ growth plan. And I hope that becomes a trend at Ford, boringly predictable when it comes to execution and delivering financials, but extremely ambitious and dynamic in creating the Ford of the future. For the quarter, we saw growth across all of our key metrics. In addition, Ford Pro and Blue were profitable in every region where we operate. Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with close to $29 billion in cash, even as we invest in growth and return capital to our shareholders. With each quarter that passes, I'm more confident and convinced and thankful we made the decision to create three separate customer-focused businesses. This has unleased clarity, speed and accountability across the company, not to mention a whole new level of discipline on capital allocation. So let me cover a few highlights. I'd like to start with Ford Pro. I know many of you were surprised at the true size of the Pro business in March when we recast our financials. Pro starts with marketing leadership in our vehicles across the world, tremendous scale and customer knowledge. And we're layering on top of that the future of our industry, an ecosystem of software and services and EV charging that we believe will be invaluable to our commercial customers. And this will unlock tremendous loyalty and profitable growth. Our strong order books in North America and Europe as well as all the demand signals we can see for Pro support our target to nearly double Pro's EBIT this year. In March, we launched the all-new Super Duty in Kentucky and Ohio. It has received tremendous reception, and it's going to strengthen a franchise that is already the market leader. Importantly, Super Duty is a platform for software and services that help our customers maximize their uptime, accelerate their productivity and lower total cost of ownership. I would also say the Super Duty launch is a good case study for the disciplined approach we're implementing across our industrial system. Simply put, we slowed the launch down, significantly increased on road and in plant quality testing, we dispatched a large and skilled launch team to our plant. We added test vehicles. We drove millions of miles to prove our durability, and we deployed new technology and artificial intelligence to catch issues. Basically, we put all the pressure in the system to find and then prevent future quality issues rather than speeding up the line to match our launch curve. Short-term patience, we believe that will result in long-term gain for our customers and yes, the company. In the quarter, Ford Pro extended its leadership in true commercial vehicle categories. Our share of the Class 1 through 7 truck and vans in the US increased by one full share point to 41% share. In Europe, we've already been the top commercial brand for eight years now running, and our share grew to more than 15%. We also maintained our EV strength in North America and Europe. In the US, E-Transit has already a 50% market share. In the quarter, we won a contract to deliver more than 9,000 E-Transit vans to the US Postal Service. Ford Pro's paid software subscriptions rose 64% in the quarter including higher revenue per unit software sales, like our telematics and charging software. With these and all the other initiatives, Ford Pro is developing into a resilient business, certainly less cyclical than the broader automotive sector. In Ford Blue, the team is focused on capitalizing on our red-hot product lineup. Our opportunity to smartly grow extends to valuable franchises with great pricing power, like the F-150, the new Maverick, the new Bronco and, of course, the Mustang. We'll grow our leadership position in pickups, in off-road, in performance and in SUVs with all new derivatives. For example, we just introduced the Bronco less than three years ago. And already, it's neck and neck in sales with the Jeep Wrangler, and it has higher transaction prices. We've also recently expanded the Bronco lineup with exciting derivatives, like the Bronco Everglades, the Bronco Raptor and the Bronco Heritage. Derivatives not only continued to contribute to our growth, but importantly, they can also drive higher transaction prices and higher returns. See, these derivatives often have 80% part commonality with the base models, but their contribution margin percents can be 30% higher with a two-fold increase in capital efficiency. We also have one of the strongest product years coming for Ford Blue. So it's just beginning. We have the new Escape, including New Hybrid. It's just arriving in dealerships now. Next week, we will reveal the all-new Ranger in the highly anticipated Ranger Raptor. That will be followed by an all-new Mustang and high-performance Dark Horse Mustang this summer. While I can't get into the details yet, we have more exciting news to share about two of America's best-selling vehicles, the F-150 and the Explorer later this year. And on top of all that, we have the Lincoln Corsair arriving at dealerships now. And of course, we just revealed the Lincoln Nautilus. Now, Ford Model e operates with a start-up intensity to build a profitable EV business with a differentiated portfolio and a differentiated customer experience. US investors now have true visibility into how Ford Model e's profitability strengthens over time, supported by volume-driven operating leverage, improvements in design and efficiency and, of course, lower battery costs. We're on track this year towards a contribution margin approaching breakeven in Model e and for our first-generation products to be EBIT margin positive by the end of next year. Wholesales were down in the quarter, which deleveraged our cost structure. Part of the decline was planned, as we have brought Mustang Mach-E production down for several weeks, so we could almost double the capacity, and we are now hitting that 35 jump per hour run rate in the plant. Volumes were also impacted by the lower output of F-150 Lightning. We did the right thing, and I congratulate my team many times by immediately stopping production and working with our battery supplier finding and then fixing the root cause of the fire that happened on the Ford property. We're now shipping Lightnings, again, taking new orders and increasing production to an annual run rate of 150,000 units, about double what we do now. We are also revealing -- we revealed an all-electric Explorer in Europe, which is now very well received. We made progress on Model e in the quarter, advancing our industrial system to scale EVs. The site preparation is already underway for our LFP battery plant in Michigan. And construction continues at the BlueOval SK Battery Park in Kentucky and, of course, BlueOval City in Tennessee. We now plan to transform our Oakville Assembly Complex into a Canadian hub of electric vehicle and battery pack manufacturing. We also continue to make progress towards locking in all the raw materials that we need to support our capacity targets in \u201826 and beyond. Model e is our center of excellence for technology, including software. A good example of that is BlueCruise, which continues to be hit with our customers. Consumer Reports rated it the top advanced, hands-free driver assist system on the market in the US, and that was just version 1.0. Our latest release, which we're OTA-ing into customers, is version 1.2. It automatically changes lanes with the tap of a turn signal, and it delivers a much more natural driving experience hands-free. We also launched BlueCruise in the UK, our Mustang Mach-E, and became the first OEM to gain approval for hands-free highway driving speed anywhere in Europe with more than -- and now BlueCruise has more than 70 million miles driven to date, and we continue to upgrade BlueCruise for customers with each over-the-air update. Before I turn it over to John, I want to share our thoughts on how the EV market is evolving in our eyes. It's easy to look at the landscape of the EV market as a mono lift. But we plan to be surgical about where we play and how we win with the right products, the right cost structure, and the right price points. We do not subscribe to a win vehicle share at any cost approach. We look at share of vehicles, of course, and share revenue. We also look at share profits and share of the customer lifetime value, and we believe this is the only way to ensure we drive appropriate return on capital over time. By 2025, we now expect there to be 45 EV models to be offered in the US in the small, medium utility segment. It will be a very saturated two-row EV market. Against this backdrop to ensure profitable growth, we know we have to have a fresh, compelling offering with the right cost structure, something we continue to improve with the Mustang Mach-E. We also found that customers are very loyal to full EV powertrains once they enter, but they are not brand-loyal for their first purchase. We capitalize on that by getting to the market early with the Mustang Mach-E and our whole lineup, and it continues to reward us with over 60% of the customers new to Ford. We're seeing that the second EV purchase is much more loyal to the brand in these developed EV markets. So. we're glad that we have all these customers in our digital and physical ecosystem. We are aggressively lowering our product costs for our current and next-generation products. You'll find out a lot more in Capital Markets Day. But in fact, for Mustang Mach-E from launch through the end of this year, we'll have reduced the building materials from Mustang Mach-E by $5,000 per vehicle. Now, in contrast to two-world crossovers that we believe will be a very saturated market, we believe Model e can be highly differentiated in markets where we know the customer well, like the three-row utility space. And as I said, we'll share more about at our Capital Markets event later this month on our product strategy. I had a chance along with John and most of our leadership team, to go to China in the last few weeks and look at the EV market in a gemba, go-and-see activity up close. It's interesting to see how customers are no longer just attracted to traditional luxury brands with EVs or even hardware design anymore. Outstanding hardware styling, performance, quality are just a given in the EV digital marketplace today. The best new brands are offering integrated digital, retail, lifestyle and experience that are software defined. This is firmly in our sights for our second-generation EVs. This software as a differentiator, plus a radically different cost structure, and the ability to attract -- attach value-added software and services, gives us confidence we can compete and win in unit, revenue, profit and vehicle share while delivering appropriate returns. And Ford Pro is already there. I'll wrap up by saying we are pleased, but we are not satisfied. As I said, solid execution and some really thrilling progress advancing our Ford+ plan. I look forward to seeing many of you in-person in three weeks for our capital markets event, where we will go much deeper into our strategy and our progress. John? John Lawler : Thanks, Jim. First quarter, wholesales were up 9% year-over-year as we delivered $3.4 billion in adjusted EBIT. Margin was 8.1%, up 140 basis points. Ford Blue and Ford Pro profit improved, reflecting favorable mix and higher net pricing. And as expected, those benefits were partially offset with a loss in Model e as we invest in our clean sheet next-generation EVs and scale our leading portfolio of first-generation electric vehicles. For the quarter, we delivered $700 million of adjusted free cash flow, improving consistent free cash flow from our industrial footprint, combined with disciplined capital allocation, provides us with significant flexibility to fund our growth while also consistently returning capital to our shareholders. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with close to $29 billion of cash and over $46 billion of liquidity. In addition, despite the recent market volatility, we successfully completed the renewal of our $17 billion sustainability-linked corporate credit facilities. So turning to our customer focused business segments. With wholesales up 6%, Ford Blue delivered $2.6 billion in EBIT and a 10.4% margin. That was 400 basis points higher than a year ago supported by favorable mix and higher volume. Our fresh and exciting product lineup continues to drive strong demand. Wholesales for Model e declined in the quarter, reflecting planned downtime that allowed us to almost double our production capacity for Mustang Mach-E. Now the profitability of any EV start-up, including Ford Model e is highly levered to volume. Importantly, holding volume constant, our first quarter EBIT margin would have been roughly flat compared to the fourth quarter at around negative 40%. We expect Ford Model e EBIT margin to improve to around negative 20% in the second half of this year, reflecting stronger per unit contribution margin and significantly higher volumes. In fact, we expect Model e contribution margin to approach breakeven this year, and we continue to target positive EBIT margin for our first-generation vehicles by the end of 2024. Ford Pro delivered an 18% increase in wholesales. And EBIT improved $900 million to $1.4 billion for the quarter, delivering a margin of 10. 3%. The improvement in profitability was supported by higher net pricing, increased volume and favorable mix. Importantly, this was achieved during a quarter when wholesales for Super Duty were down, both year-over-year and sequentially as we ramped up production of our all-new version of this highly popular truck. Ford Credit delivered EBT of $300 million, down $600 million from a year ago, reflecting lower financing margin, higher credit losses and lower lease income, all of which has been reflected in our full year outlook. Credit loss performance remains strong and is still below the historical average but beginning to normalize. Auction values remain robust, but down from their peak in the first half of 2022. Ford Credit liquidity remained strong at $26 billion, up $5 billion from year-end. In addition, despite the volatile market conditions, the company has already completed $12 billion of public issuance or roughly 50% of its 2023 funding plan. Turning to our outlook. We continue to expect full year 2023 total company adjusted EBIT of $9 billion to $11 billion, adjusted free cash flow of about $6 billion and capital expenditures between $8 billion to $9 billion. This guidance includes headwinds that reflect global economic uncertainty, higher industry-wide customer incentives as vehicle supply and demand rebalance, lower past service pension income, exchange and investments in growth such as customer service and connected services. And tailwinds driven by improvement in the supply chain, our higher industry volume with SAARs of about $15 million and $13 million in the US and Europe, respectively, launch of our all-new Super Duty and lower cost of goods sold, including materials and commodities. Turning to the segments. Ford Blue to deliver full year EBIT of about $7 billion cost improvements and higher industry volumes will likely be offset partially by pricing headwinds, as inventory stocks continue to normalize and industry incentives rise through the year, along with adverse exchange. Ford Model e to report an EBIT loss of around $3 billion, largely reflecting disciplined investment in new products and capacity. We also anticipate Ford Pro's EBIT to nearly double to around $6 billion compared to our 2022 results. The gain is driven by improved pricing and volume, including the benefits from the launch of our all-new Super Duty. And EBT for Ford Credit is anticipated to be around $1.3 billion. Additionally, I hope that all of you are blocking time for our next capital markets event on May 21 and 22, here on Dearborn. This will be an important couple of days as we update you on Fords strategy, take a deep dive into financial targets and KPIs for each of our customer-centered business segments and talk about our capabilities and expectations for software and services. By the time we're done, I believe you will even be better equipped to value the expected contributions of each of the segments to Ford's overall growth and return. So that wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your minds. Thank you. Operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Jonas : Thanks, everybody. So Jim, you've compared the current environment for EVs to the year 1913, saying that no one should really be surprised that Tesla is cutting price so much. And then I think you asked the question maybe rhetorically, who's going to blink on growth? So if I put your own question to you, Jim, will Ford blink on growth? Jim Farley : Thanks, Adam. It depends -- well, first of all, our first three EVs are all very different in terms of pricing. I think the Lightning's price is up $11,000 since we launched, and E-Transit is up a lot. So -- and of course, we're increasing production to get that scale benefit. So the most important thing we've learned three or four years ago is be careful where you compete, and we have selected where we compete extremely carefully. We want to go after segments where we have a great reputation, but there's a lot of conquest customers. And we want to innovate beyond just the powertrain, like Pro Power Onboard and as well software. We now know the three shippable software stacks : safety and security, productivity for Pro and, of course, partial autonomy. All those are really great hedges against the inevitable overcapacity in certain segments. We could see the overcapacity in the two-row electric utility segment like years ago, Adam. Literally, like before we had finished the Mach-E development. We knew this was coming. That's why we got our team together. We brought down the cost of the bill of material by $5,000. We aren't waiting for a minor change. We're not doing things like we normally do, and we continue to get the data off the vehicle to make the software better and better so the customers' vehicles get better every day. So I would say the message from me as the CEO is that, we are not going to price just to gain market share. We will always balance a healthy profit roadmap in the first generation of products, it's pretty challenging because we didn't know what we didn't know four years ago when we designed them. But now we're two years into designing the second cycle. And in Capital Markets Day, we will take you through why we believe that 8% margin is totally realistic, despite all the pricing pressure that we will absolutely get, because everyone wants to grow. So, I would say, we're quite different than maybe some of the pure EV players that are pricing just for growth. We will always balance that, because we want a profitable EV business, and we're pulling every lever we can in the first-gen products. The second gen is where we can really make hay. Adam Jonas : I appreciate that, Jim. And just as a quick follow-up, because what you're saying is really landing well with me. It's resonating. But I just get a little nervous with the 2 million unit capacity target that you have hanging out there for the second half of 2026, which, just in my opinion is a crazy high number. Can I get you to admit that volume targets? And I think you're saying this, and I don't want to preempt the Capital Markets Day, but can I get you to admit that volume targets as the success criteria alone, it really is the wrong thing to continue to perpetuate? Thanks, Jim. Jim Farley : Yes, absolutely. Look, we all have to plan our business professionally, and scaling is important. Look what happened in the first quarter for Model e. We want that scaling benefit, but that is not success. In fact, I would say, the more we study this -- our trip to China was a real epiphany for our leadership team. I would say, the more -- the thing that I look for as a CEO is not necessarily just the volume growth, it's actually how fast we use the data off the vehicle to make the customers' software experience better. That, to me -- the quickness of that loop is the fitness for differentiating brand and profit in the future for this new digital product category we happen to call electric vehicles. To me, yes, volume is important, but that quickness of that loop, which we're already on a 10 million OTA. We've now gained 65% more miles traveled on BlueCruise in three months. We were only 42 million miles three months ago, we're now at 70 million, and the reason why that's growing so fast is because we continue to do OTAs to BlueCruise to make it better and better. On Ford Pro, those software subscriptions are growing fast. So, to me, of all the metrics I look for as a proof point for our success in this new digital product category we call EVs, I think that's the one, Adam, I look for the close -- the best. And we will always balance profit with scaling. Adam Jonas : Thanks Jim. Operator : The next question is from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : Hi everybody. I'd actually like to follow-up on Adam's question. I'm just looking at the $900 million increase in structural costs in the quarter and I know that the investments you're making are aimed at driving growth. But in the past, when the industry has experienced higher structural costs, it put a lot of pressure on everybody to hit volume targets, which ultimately wasn't good for pricing. And I know you said, Jim, that you're planning to target segments where you've got strong pricing power and you're confident in conquesting customers. But can you just talk a little bit about whether you agree with that assertion that there's going to be pressure even on Ford just given the magnitude of the structural cost increase that you're taking on? And what kind of flexibility do you have to make the targets if volume or pricing assumptions come in a bit short? John Lawler : Yes, Adam. Let me -- sorry, you're following up on Adam's question. So, let me, Rod, start off on the cost there. Yes, you're right. We did see our structural costs go up in the quarter on a year-over-year basis as we continue to invest, as Jim said, in our EVs, in our digital architecture and our software. I think for us, a key part of that is bringing those structural costs down in Blue over time and then driving efficiencies in our overall cost structure and contribution costs, some material costs, in warranty, in freight, et cetera. So, that's where we need to see the turn on our cost structure in those areas as well. And then cost structure coming out of Blue as we continue to invest in e and Pro. Now, of course, we have to do that at an efficient level so that it doesn't put that much pressure on the business, but Jim can talk about this more. But as we're investing in the growth of EVs, we're not doing it where we're proliferating. We're looking to be very focused on the segments we're going into, be very disciplined on the complexity in the number of top hats and models that we have, have the right footprint, the industrial plants needed to have the right efficiency levels. And we'll talk more about that at Capital Markets Day, but we're very, very thoughtful of the fact that as that investment goes in, it needs to be very efficient. Rod Lache : Okay. And just maybe secondly, just switching gears to -- your variable costs like material freight and commodities were up $1.3 billion in the quarter. Are you still expecting $1 billion of savings in variable costs and $1 billion to $1.5 billion in commodities? And that's the case, you also have the super volume ramping later this year. I just would be curious about whether you can give us a little bit more color on the first half to second half assumption since your full year guidance implies some pretty meaningful decline in the year versus the level we're seeing right now? John Lawler : Yeah. So when you look at it from a cost standpoint, let's just unpack what happened last year. When you look at the cost increases in 2022, only about 15% of that happened in the first quarter. So on a year-over-year basis, coming out of last year, this was a tough read. If you look at it sequentially, when you look at our costs on a sequential basis, our costs were down in the quarter. And they were down significantly in Blue. They were up a little bit in e, and they were about flat in Pro. So, yeah, we have got to gain traction on the cost reductions for sure as we go through the second half of the year, and you'll start to see that come through in the second half. Overall, when you look at it from a cost standpoint, we expect our total cost to come down and cost of goods sold to come down about $2 billion versus the $2.5 billion, and that's primarily reflecting the fact that commodities aren't coming down as quickly as we thought. So that's where we see costs unfolding through the second half of the year. Rod Lache : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good afternoon guys. Just a first question on fleet, because that seems to be leading the volume recovery here early in 2023. Just curious how much of a tailwind that was for you and where that shows up in the numbers, whether it's all in Pro or do we actually see something actually showing up on the Blue and in e side? And how much do you expect that to continue to be a tailwind as you go through the course of this year and maybe even for the next year or two? John Lawler : Yeah. The league business is largely sitting in Pro, John. We see that continuing through the year. We see Pro -- strength in Pro as we go through the year. There's considerable pent-up demand. We now have the new Super Duty. We'll be launching the Transit in the second half of the year, and we expect that to continue. So that's where we see quite a bit of opportunity as we go through the year, as we expect the profits in Pro to double this year versus last year. On Blue, what we saw in the first quarter for Blue was about flat pricing. It was up 1/10, a strong mix, really strong mix and some volume increases in Blue in the first quarter. And that strong mix was on F-Series. And that's because last year, we had the TICO issue, which kept our series mix down, plus we were launching Escape this year in the first quarter. So when you look at it, that's where we see things unfolding. When we go through the rest of the year on Blue, we expect that mix to come off. That's not going to repeat itself as we run through the rest of the year. Jim Farley : On Pro, I just want to highlight a few things, John. There was a huge backorder of vehicle, pent-up demand for small business in the US and Europe that is still not even close to being satisfied. So yes, a lot of the bigger fleets, U-Hauls, you can imagine that they are the truck and van customers, we've done a good job getting them the product they want. They still want more, a lot more. And this is before we launch a new Super Duty and, of course, a new Transit in Europe. And so there's a lot of pent-up demand for large fleets. But most of the real profitable Pro business is small and medium-sized business, and they have been waiting literally three to four years for their Transit and Super Duty\u2019s. So the pent-up demand we're seeing now is really those customers, and there's still a lot of pricing power and lots of pent-up orders for. And especially, now that we have brand-new Super Duty and Transit in Europe, it's going to be even more intense to get those products. So good -- the larger fleets, we've done a good job getting them more product, but there's a ton of pent-up demand for Pro vehicles with those small and medium-sized business, which is the heart and soul of the TAM. John Murphy : And Jim, if I could follow up just on the pricing discussion. There seems to be a change in the philosophy of the way that people are thinking about this, particularly that new, large competitor that is cutting price. And that you can cut price on the front end and not make a lot of money on the hardware, but you can make a whole lot of money on the software and services on the back end so you're not so worried about profit on the front end. You think you can make it up on the back end. As you think about your business evolving over time, do you think in five years' time plus that you're going to be sort of selling the vehicles hardware and making all the money on the back end? I mean how should we think about sort of the balance of how the money is earned on vehicles going forward? Jim Farley : Will that business model, I mean outside of maybe Tesla, that business model is live and well at Ford right now in Pro. So when I answer your question, please understand that we are operating that kind of business, where our after sales and software is now large 30-plus percent attach rates. And I would say the answer is I am not giving any relief to my vehicle teams for software sales or any kind of margin advantage. They -- those products have to get to 8% on their own. And we see the software and especially for Pro, the physical after sales. Those attach rates charging equipment that we're seeing 30-plus percent tax rates, that's plus business for us. That's an annuity we want to create, and we do not want to commoditize our products. That is not our strategy. Maybe someone else's, but not ours. And that's coming from a company that is already doing like we could do that now with Pro, but we are not going to do that. I hope that's clear. John Murphy : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I read, Jim that you recently said at a charity event in Detroit, we're going to have to rethink what the Ford brand means in a place like China. So where do you think you stand with regard to your China operations currently? I mean Lincoln seems like a bright spot. But what aspirations do you have for your operations in that market, either in terms of the portfolio or margins or returns? And what time frame would you like to achieve those aspirations? Jim Farley : Well, thank you. And I guess that's the end of my charity work. But we -- Pro and Blue are profitable everywhere in the world, including China. But I'm glad you asked this question, because we went to China to finalize our strategy as a leadership team. And I guess I would explain -- so our ICE business there is profitable. Lincoln is a success. But you have to look at China through the strategy lens, it's not a huge business for us. And we believe that not only is the biggest EV market in the world, but customers digitally are ahead of the rest of the world, and so it's a really important market for us. And what we really see in our presence there is battery tech, digital experience for the customer and advanced product, both software and hardware integrated. Our strategy going forward in China will change. We're going to go to a much lower investment, leaner, more focused business in China with higher returns. And I'll give you an example. I don't want to lay out the whole strategy here. But since you asked the question, I think our partnership with JMC is a good example. We are going to double down on our commercial business, including EVs in China. We also believe that JMC can be an export hub for affordable EVs and ICE commercial vehicles using the Ford distribution network for our Pro business around the world. We have great Pro dealers in South America, in south Africa, in Australia, Mexico, places that we can export. And now we have a source of a fantastic affordable EVs and commercial ICE products with JMC. That's an example of how we're going to approach China from now on. We're not going to try to serve everyone. It will be a lower investment, leaner, much more focused business in China. And we're going to have a team on the ground that will be global resources for the company, because of how important the market is in the EV. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, great. Thanks. And then just lastly, what is the latest you're seeing in terms of auto loan APR, credit availability, maybe in light of some of the turmoil that we've seen in the banking sector in the US? The SAAR has been very strong this year, in line or stronger than your expectation for $15 million total SAAR, particularly in light of the higher rates, maybe helped by the strong equity in used vehicles. But just curious, if you're hearing anything maybe different at the margin from your dealers or customers or just how you're thinking about the auto finance market generally. Marion Harris : Yeah. Hey, Ryan, it's Marion. We have seen a number of banks pulling back from auto lending, which is kind of a hallmark of banks through difficult markets, and that's created a bit of a pricing opportunity for us, as well as improvement in share -- financing share for us. So I don't see it getting a lot better over the coming months for banks. But the credit availability is still there for customers and captives across the industry, are going to continue to support the OEMs. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Please, go ahead. James Picariello : Hi, everyone. First question on price. So, is pricing overall is still expected to be neutral for the year? It sounds as though Blue is guided to be negative for the full year as incentive spend picks up. But, yes, could you just help unpack how we should be thinking about this year's price for Model e and Pro with the Super Duty strength still to come? John Lawler : Yes. So, overall, for us, our bridge from 2022 to 2023, we expect pricing for us to be neutral. We still expect that to be the case. We do expect the second half to see pricing pressures, especially on Blue as we see supply and demand normalize. Pro, we believe there will be pricing strength throughout the year. And on e, we see pricing being slightly down on a year-over-year basis as well. So, overall, no change to what we had talked about at the teaching. We see pricing is neutral for Ford. James Picariello : Okay, got it. And then just to confirm, you talked about 20% -- or minus 20% Model e margins for the second half. Is that right? John Lawler : Contribution margin, yes. James Picariello : Contribution margin. Okay. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it. John Lawler : Sorry. About -- no, no, no. Total margin, contribution margin positive, total margin would be -- EBIT margin would be minus 20%. James Picariello : Got it. Yes. So, my follow-on to that because that's what I thought you'd sit. Can you bridge what the benefits are from a materials perspective, scaling in terms of the buckets maybe that you provided at the teach-in, what helps get to that minus 20% run rate for the second half? Thanks. John Lawler : It's not different than what's in the teach-in. I mean when you look at it, we're going to scale through the year. We start to grow volumes. We have the LFP battery coming in, and then we have the design reductions that Jim talked about, getting to about a $5,000 reduction on Mach-E. We have a significant reduction in play on Lightning as well. So, it's the same buckets that we talked about at the teach-in. James Picariello : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Dan Levy with Barclays. Please go ahead. Dan Levy : Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to follow-up on that last question on the contribution margin. And I know you didn't disclose contribution margin at the teach-in. But just at the midpoint of if I look at what you disclosed in your deck, it's roughly negative $4,000 contribution margin right now, and you said a lot of this is on sort of material reduction. So, I just wanted to understand how easily you can reduce content mid-cycle of a product. I know you said that there are some design changes that you can do. But typically, you see more material content modifications at the end of a product cycle. So, just want to get a sense of your visibility on content modification to get that contribution margin to breakeven? John Lawler : So, there's a couple of things you can do from a content standpoint to drive your cost down. One of them is we're using the digital connectivity of the vehicle to understand what features that customers find valuable. And if they're not using something that we have on the vehicle, we can design that out. The other thing we're doing is, as Jim said, we didn't wait on Mach-E. So, we started to put together what we thought of as bundled actions into minor programs as we work through Model e, and we're launching those as we go through the year this year and into next year to get us to that $5,000 reduction. As a first mover, we felt it was important to get to market quickly. We've readily admitted that the design and efficiency of our first-generation products isn't where it needs to be, and we're working on that -- those reductions now. And we're taking all the learnings from that and incorporating it into our second-generation products and we'll talk more about that in a couple of weeks at Capital Markets Day. So, yes, there's things you can do. You just need to be thoughtful about it as you go through the product. And where there's opportunities, you bundle them together, and you do a minor launch, you do a change and you go. And that's what we're doing on e, and we're using the connected data to take out features that the customers don't value. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, I just want to touch on some of the earlier questions that were asked and this notion of how you're looking at volume. And I think the message clearly you're making is that you're not necessarily -- you're balancing that volume with profit. But historically, this has been a business that is dictated by volume. This is dictated by utilization. And if I read your comments correctly that you're focused on unique segments and you want to get out of the fray a little bit, that would probably tell me that if you're punching at four million units a year now, which is low versus actually where you've been historically, that if you're focused on these more premium segments or more unique segments that there could be a much lower volume going forward. So how should we think about your volume more broadly? I realize that's probably a better question for the CMD. But how are you thinking about structurally what type of volume we should look at in the future? Jim Farley : Yeah, good question. So I want to make it really clear that our growth strategy for the company is very aggressive, and it focuses on conquest customers. So we plan to grow, and that capacity increase for e and Pro is mostly additive to the company's overall growth. And what gives us confidence in that is that we are targeting conquest vehicles and software to customer categories that we know really well. It's not lost on us that when we launched Lightning, almost all the full-size pickup truck EV customers were new to Ford and new to the segment. So what we learned in Lightning's case, a segment traditionally has been 13% of the industry for pretty much my whole career can be much, much bigger when you add new product features like a funk, lockable storage for a full-size truck, zero emissions and the ability to power your house for three days. A lot of new customers bought a Lightning that never owned a pickup truck before. And we intend to do that with three-row crossover and with a bunch of EV Pro vehicles, which we think will be a huge growth for us. So you should expect that a lot of that capacity we're putting in is for growth for the company, but we are not going to grow at any cost. We're going to manage that incremental new growth for profitability and growth together, and we've put a lot of thinking into our product strategy. One of the most important aspects of our product strategy is not to have too much top hat engineering. We want to have a lot of scale per top hat. And again, we'll go into the capital markets day, as you said, because I think it's best answer there with real examples where you can really see our strategy coming to life. But we've learned a lot for Lightning and for Mach-E. Frankly, the number of new customers we're seeing is very encouraging for us because of our capacity increase. And we know that the second cycle product can be radically simpler and lower cost, aside from the scaling effect. And again, we'll lay this out in capital markets day for you and for everyone else. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Tom Narayan with RBC. Please go ahead. Tom Narayan : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just had two quick follow-ups. So for Blue, it sounds like the downshift kind of implied in the rest of the year is really coming more from mix than not price as you're saying net neutral on price for the full year. Is that right? John Lawler : Yes. So mix -- we had very strong mix in Q1. We don't expect that to repeat as we go through the year, and we do expect on a full year basis that we will see some pressures on pricing in Blue on a full year basis as we go through the second half of the year. Remember, what's really important is to understand that run rate of price as you come out of the back end of the year because you have the accrual impact for all of the units that are in stock and then you have to take the incentive levels from Q1 of 2024 and apply it to those units that are in stock. So you've got to think about that on a run rate business coming out of the end of the year. But overall, yes, it's -- for Blue, we definitely see that there'll be some pressure on pricing. Tom Narayan : Okay. And then another follow-up. So on this question of attach rates, you have a 30% attach rate on Pro, which is amazing. And just curious, as you think about that, is there an incentive perhaps to increase that attach rate perhaps by sacrificing on price? Presumably, those subscription revenues come in at higher margins, or is the view we're not going to -- at the end of the day, we make these products and these subscription services are add-on to enhance the product. I mean how do you think about that trade-off? Thanks. Jim Farley : It's a great question. Right now, given the order bank we see for Pro's business, the more we can invest in profitable high-growth products, the better. But you should think it's a very important question you're asking for Pro, because I don't think everyone would realize that the margins on software and the margins on parts are actually pretty similar. So in the end of the day, the customer wants us to have fantastic products for Pro, but they're largely regulated, kind of box or pickup truck pet or whatever. So really for the customer, the value is going to be the software, the attached rates and the experience they get with an integrated approach. Think about this future state, which we are executing too. 100% prediction of failure of components before they sale, okay. You sense vehicle to do that? It\u2019s integrated and software, the software gets better everyday, so you can predict failure more precisely and for more components. The customer gets a vehicle that never really goes out of service. If you're a small, medium size commercial Pro customer, which is most of the TAM in Europe and the US, those customers, they take one van down, that\u2019s 20% of the revenue. So they will pay because they can drive more business with the vehicle that\u2019s never off the road. So think about this not as a trade-off between the vehicle profit, the parts business and the software. Think about it from the customer standpoint as an integrated approach, where everything is designed for each other, where you can't think of doing prognostics without a vehicle design to do that or the fulfillment of the parts business pre-picking the part before the customer even gets there, so that they could do the service really quickly, so the vehicle is not off the road for very long, if it does need service. So it's -- I don't really think we think of it from the customer standpoint as a like trade from margin. We think of designing the whole system, so that every piece of it adds value, and you can't kind of think of the physical product or the software independently of each other. Now, it may turn out over time, let's say, on the low part of Pro. That's a software in the parts business is more profitable. But from the customer standpoint, we're designing the pro business where they're inseparable, like the prognostic example. I hope that makes sense to you. Tom Narayan : Yes, it does. Thank you. Operator : And the last question today is from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead. Emmanuel Rosner : Hi. Thank you very much. So I think you announced a price cut on the Mach-E today. And to your point, Jim, I think this is a more competitive segment within all the various EV segments. Jim Farley : Yes, yes. Emmanuel Rosner : Can you maybe comment on the demand environment for Lightning? There's -- I've seen some anecdotal evidence of some decent amount sitting on some dealers' lots. I read that you're planning to ship some to Norway, which it feels like the US pickup market should have more demand than your ability to supply. So can you just maybe talk a little bit about where Lightning demand is in general and whether sort of like cost actions are needed in order to bring down the price? Jim Farley : But there's only one or two in the market, so I can understand why maybe some people would look at it that way if they don't have a product in the market. But from our standpoint, the Lightning demand is outstanding. We've taken $11,000 worth of pricing on Lightning, $11,000. And, yes, thank goodness that we are seeing now some dealer stock for the first time in like two years for Lightning. And we are really excited about our cost reductions and, of course, the software we're shipping at the vehicle like BlueCruise 1.2. But the demand for Lightning is really, really strong. I look at Bring a Trailer every week, because two years ago, it was like, I don't know, the most popular new vehicle on Bring a Trailer was a Lightning with four miles on it, that someone was flipping. And the prices have come down and they're basically at MSRP now. So we're selling it at full MSRP. The demand is higher. In fact, I would say that the pricing is higher than MSRP still. And we're totally sold out in Norway, like we are everywhere. So this is a global segment, we believe. Ford is clearly the number one pickup truck maker in the world, and we're not going to just keep our pickup trucks in the US. It's a global market. So we feel great about the demand or else we wouldn't be doubling production this year. Emmanuel Rosner : Yes. Thanks for that Jim. And then, just maybe one follow-up for John. So curious if you could just put a final point on the puts and takes for your unchanged 2023 guidance. I think you mentioned in terms of costs for materials and freight maybe now a $2 billion benefit instead of $2.5 billion. Are there any other big pieces which are either more or less of a benefit or a headwind than you saw previously? John Lawler : Yes, sure. So, we had shared what we thought the bridge was earlier this year. And so as I said, we think pricing overall for us will be about neutral for the year. We said that our COGS are primarily material and logistics. We had said that it would be about $2.5 billion. We think it's about $2 billion now. That's primarily due to commodities not coming down as quickly as we had thought. Volumes, we were up 9% in Q1. We expect to be about -- up about 6%-ish for the full year overall. So, I think you can look at that, and those are the three areas that have basically changed versus what we had bridged before. We see past service pension at about a $2 billion negative. Credit, we don't change there, we're about that $1.4 million, and we're going to continue to invest in growth and then we stock exchange and other of about $1 billion. So, that bridge largely remains the same, except we got a little bit of movement between some volume and some commodity costs. Emmanuel Rosner : Perfect. Thank you.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, everyone. My name is MJ, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lynn Tyson : Thank you, MJ, and welcome to Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO; and John Lawler, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit and Ted Cannis, CEO of Ford Pro. Today's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. taxes in the appendix of the earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 26. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EPS and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis and product mix is volume weighted. A quick update some upcoming IR before I turn the call over to Jim. On Thursday, August 10, Ford prone will do a fireside sat at the Safer Automotive Conference in New York with Auto Brinkman. And on Wednesday, September 27, our Treasury, Dave Web, will participate in a green financing panel at the Goldman Sachs Global Sustainability Forum. Before I turn it over to Jim, I just want to recognize one really important individual investor call, and that's my mom, who has listened to every single one of our Ford Investor Relations call since I joined. She is a tough cookie and always gives us a good working over after we do the call. So I just want to say Mom, welcome to being on the call. Jim, I'll turn it over to you. Jim Farley : Well, first, mom, thank you for Lynn. Thanks to all of you for joining us on the May Capital Markets event, where we shared our vision to refound our 120-year-old American icon and create a Ford that thrives at this exciting intersection between great vehicles and digital experiences. Now the world is changing fast, but I have never been more confident in our Ford+ plan. As you've heard me say, our intention is to match this exciting long-term vision for Ford with boringly predictable execution quarter after quarter, year after year. And that's the biggest takeaway from our second quarter : strong growth, strong earnings, cash flow and progress on the fundamentals of our business, including software. We are very bullish on the potential for Ford Pro, which had an outstanding quarter. It's unique to Ford. It's a true powerhouse. At the same time, Ford Blue is taking advantage of fresh, appealing products to generate healthy revenues, healthy share and profits, while Model E continues to scale with popular, first-generation electric vehicles. We're going to dive more into the electric vehicle market during Q&A. But clearly, this transition to EVs is dynamic and so much more than just a change in propulsion. The number of global entrants is increasing even at the high end and the pricing pressure has dramatically increased in the past 60 days. Despite these puts and takes, we have confidence in the underlying trajectory of Ford's business. Our portfolio of businesses is strong, thanks to businesses like Pro and Blue, and we are raising our estimated EBIT guidance this year to $11 billion to $12 billion. Operationally, we continue to be focused on capital discipline, solid returns even as we face uncertainties in the external environment. Supply chain disruptions are persistent, but they're now easy. And we have more work to do to streamline our industrial system, reducing costs and improving quality. While EV adoption is still growing, the paradigm has shifted. EV price premiums over internal combustion vehicles fell more than $3,000 in the second quarter and nearly $5,000 in first half. We expect the EV market to remain volatile until the winners and losers shake out, and we are confident from a brand, from our incredible product strategy, our software, our scale and our cost position, we will be one of the winners long term. Why do I say that? We moved quickly to establish our EV nameplates in the unique segments, not like others, the Lightning, the Maki, the ETrans. We're building EV brand lowers. It's critical. Many of our EV customers are all new to Ford. This is a significant asset to Ford given our new Gen 2 products and profitability that we'll be launching soon. For Gen 2, we focused on fewer, higher volume models in the right segments to take advantage of our strengths and knowledge of customers, even Conquest customers. For example, work vehicles, pickups for retail customers and spacious seven-passenger SUVs. I am so glad we didn't bet the farm on two row crossovers ICE like EV platforms, like so many have. We moved early on LFP, especially production in the U.S., giving us a diversity of chemistry cost advantage. We are now offering Mach-E with LFP technology for sale in the U.S. With the addition of Tesla Superchargers and the Fast Chargers that our dealers are installed, the Blue Oval charging network will be the single largest integrated fast charge network across the U.S. and Canada, and this blanket coverage from tens of thousands of fast chargers is core to our strategy. It helps us with smaller, lower cost and faster charging batteries. We have the flexibility to offer customers choice of ICE, hybrids and full electrics in the years to come. Our hybrid offerings are extremely popular. F-150 is the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. for 46 years, 10% of all F-150s and 56% of all Mavericks sold in the U.S. are sold as hybrids. We are adding hybrid options across our ICE line-up, and we expect to quadruple our hybrid sales in the next five years, and we're already number two in the market last year. Starting January 01, we moved to a new retail model for Model e, way ahead of our competition, again, a differentiated model that will deliver non-negotiated price, a simple shopping and ownership experience and remote services for all of our customers. This is critical to a conquest digital brand. And finally, with these new models, we are nimble and we can adapt to the market fluctuations real time, and you've seen this with both the Mach-E and the Lightning as we are adding enormous capacity to meet pent-up demand. We are optimizing for the long-term value creation. More than 60% of Mach-E and half of Lightning customers are new to Ford. These new customers have significant lifetime value potential beyond because of the shippable software. But we are disciplined as we grow, and we won't bear an unlimited cost to acquire those customers and build our install base. In line with that, we are now targeting to reach 600,000 annual production units of EVs by next year, and we maintain flexibility on where we reach when we reach two million total EV global capacity because we are balancing growth, profitability and returns. At the same, we believe demand for our internal combustion and our hybrid portfolio will be durable with the window of growth in Ford Blue potentially longer and richer than most expected. We've proven we can design and develop popular vehicles that stand out from the competition irregardless of their propulsion, and we made sure Ford is profitable as we move through this ICE EV transition. So let me cover a few highlights for each of our business segments. The appeal in pricing power of Ford Blues, iconic vehicles, those Mustang lineups, the Maverick, the F-150, the Explorers, all those cool, new derivatives from Ford, boy, these products remain strong. Ford was America's number one brand in the first half of this year. Also in the first half of this year, our best seller, F-150, by the way, 100% built in the U.S. that our competitors can't say, grew almost three times the rate of the overall pickup truck market. We expect our pricing and revenue to continue in the second half as we have new launches at Mustang. And I would add pace of new product introductions for Ford will only accelerate from here. We plan to introduce, for example, an all-new F-150 and F-150 PowerBoost hybrid at the Detroit Show in September. Now outside North America, the Ranger and its sister product, the Everest SUV, are the backbone of a much stronger, more profitable international business. The all-new version of the Ranger and Everest are most popular and profitable than the previous model, and Ranger alone is now the truck leader and eighth large pickup truck market around the globe. Our aftersales business continues to grow, and we are on track to launch over 2,000 mobile service units by the end of this year. That is unique to Ford. Ford Blues, other top priorities are to follow reduce our cost structure. To do that, we've launched a lean, disciplined operating system that reaches into every one of our plants, every part we buy, every engineering decision we make. We're making progress, but this is just the start of our culture change. Turning to Pro, which is proving to be a unique strength to Ford. I mean what one of our competitors would get to have Ford Pro? It's a $50 billion commercial business with the potential to become a high-margin, high-multiple hardware, software and service company akin to John Deere. In the quarter, volume, pricing and software subscriptions continue to accelerate as we capture significant pent-up demand across multiple commercial sectors and locations in both North America and in Europe. We are now realizing the full benefits of our new Super Duty. Super Duty sales in Q2 were up 28%, and the strong demand for our flagship work product is going to fuel our earnings growth for years to come. And our brand business also continued to grow in the quarter. And that's before the launch of the all-new version of Ford Pro's other key profit pillar, the one Transit in Europe. Our share of the U.S. 127 commercial truck and van market is over 40% this year so far. That is twice our nearest competitor and brand, twice. And it's a similar story in Europe, where the Transit franchises help make Ford the top-selling commercial brand for 8 years in a row. Ford Pro has all the attributes of the business that is difficult to disrupt. Our combination of services, software, dominant product, dominant market share, upfitting and large dealer physical repair work will not be easy to match. Accordingly, we will continue to shift more investment to fuel Ford Pro's growth and press our advantage with full flexibility between EV and ICE. So now let's get to the big change in our industry. And it happens to start including with Ford Pro because Ford Pro is at the forefront of this biggest change, the digital transformation, going to software and services as a differentiator. We already have over or about 550,000 subscribers, paid subscribers and service subscribers, and Ford Pro is 80% of those. We are already seeing 50% gross margins on today's software services. For example, telematics, where customers are now paying $20 a month, and that's before we even introduced our fully-networked architecture in the new vehicles that launched just in the year or 2. Moving to the next profitable software segment. Since launch, BlueCruise customers have traveled nearly 1.4 billion hands-free hours across North America, and that is a 44% increase since the end of Q1, 44% increase in three months. In July, we hit our 100 millionth-mile driven, hands-free with BlueCruise. Our Version 1.0 was chosen by consumer reports earlier this year as the number one rated system in the U.S. And since then, we've continued to enhance and accelerate launching two more versions of BlueCruise Cross through over their updates, each significantly improving the driver's experience. And we have now shortened the cycle time between these new versions. As a company, we're investing significantly in software. But the bigger story is the elite talent we have brought into Ford. They are attracted by the opportunity to revolution, the experience of owning and driving a vehicle for millions of customers, driving an iconic brand like Ford. I really believe we have the industry's best minds working on this incredible digital revolution. And with that talent, we are moving from our supplier control firmware to our own fully-networked electric architecture. And this will reach across all vehicles : ICE, hybrids and EVs. This is a key point because it allows us to have far higher installed base than just EVs alone. Think of the F-150. There are three key applications sit on top of this new software platform. The first one is safety and security. We haven't launched it yet. But boy, are we working hard to launch it. It will give customers ability to monitor the surroundings in their vehicle on top sites are at home. It will transform the experience of owning a Ford. The second one, of course, is driver assist technology. BlueCruise is just the beginning of our ambition. And the third one is productivity. Like the telematics that we sell a pro, but we're not going to stop there. Right around the corner, we'll have predictive failure components. Now imagine our productivity gain for our Pro customers who never were off the road because we know something is going to go bad before it does. This is just the beginning of the applications. These services will bring high-margin, reoccurring revenue streams that are less capital-intensive and cyclical than our traditional vehicle sales. To wrap up, there is understandably a lot of in the UAW contract discussions that began two weeks ago. We won't negotiate public, but I would like to share our general approach and our BlueCruise. When it comes to building in America and partnering with UAW, Ford from all the other automakers, most other major industrial companies. We believe, as Sean and Chuck do, the Ford should do our part to support the middle class, create vibrant communities and build a strong American and industrial [ pat ]. Everyone knows or didn't go bankrupt, and we didn't take a bailout, but they may not know that we added a significant amount of UAW manufacturing jobs. In fact, thousands of jobs in the U.S. since The Great Recession. We have actually done more than is required by our contract to add jobs, move employees from temporary to permanent, improve benefits, and we're on our way to spending $1 billion to improve our factory working conditions. It comes with some additional costs. But for us, this is not simply a number-crunching exercise. We believe over time, customers will appreciate and reward our approach and our workforce to be more committed to delivering BlueCruise through our transformation. So although these negotiations promise to be challenging, our goal is to build a bridge to the future with our employees based on mutual trust and a spirit of problem solving with the UAW leadership, and of course, our incredible workforce. Over to you, John. John Lawler : Thanks, Jim. On the power of our three customer-focused segments really starting this time through. In the quarter, we delivered an 8% increase in wholesale, adjusted EBIT of $3.8 billion and an 8.4% adjusted EBIT margin. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBIT was primarily driven by higher net pricing and volume, partially offset by higher as we ramp EVs and expected lower core credit profits. In the quarter, we delivered $2.9 billion of adjusted free cash flow, underscoring the improved performance generated from our industrial footprint. This consistency, combined with disciplined capital allocation, provides significant flexibility to fund our growth while also consistently returning capital to our shareholders. We continue to target returning 40% to 50% of free cash flow to investors. And earlier this morning, we declared our third quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $30 billion of cash and over $47 billion of liquidity. We're recently upgraded by both Moody's and DBRS and demonstrating the trajectory of the business. Now turning to our customer-focused business segments. With revenue growth of 5%, Ford Blue delivered $2.3 billion in EBIT with a margin of over 9%. Despite these strong results, EBIT declined modestly year-over-year, including the nonrecurrence of a onetime insurance settlement. That said, costs were flat, and we expect this to continue to improve in the second half of this year. Now importantly, Ford Blue continues to be profitable in every region, reflecting the disciplined capital allocation that has fundamentally derisked our global business. We're now really starting to see the results, a fresh, exciting product line-up that is driving both strong demand and price in key markets across the globe. And perhaps the strongest example of this is F-150, an incredible product, which many don't understand, effectively, our F-150 equivalent outside North America and that drives meaningful bottom line results for both blue and Mach-E. Now turning to Mach-E. Revenue increased 39% year-over-year and more than doubled significantly as we added capacity for both Manati and the F-150 lighting. Contribution margin and EBIT margin were both negative with pricing and volume pressures intensified, and that's impacting all OEMs. Given the rapid and dynamic gain on the pricing environment, we no longer expect to see contribution margin breakeven for our Gen 1 products this year. One of the primary benefits of Ford's industry-leading reporting transparency, product leadership and customer insight is that we can quickly react to market reality. We know that once a customer chooses an AV brand, they stick with that brand over time. So as we make pricing decisions and assess customer acquisition costs, we're not only weighing the immediate impact on profitability but also how this translates to the lifetime value of that customer. Despite the dynamic environment, we remain committed to delivering 8% EBIT margin target in 2026, and we have a real strategic benefit. Our second-generation products are being developed to complete with all new digital architecture. So while the path to sustainable profitability may not look quite the same as we previously thought, we're confident in our ability to deliver through a more efficient product design, cost efficiencies and growth in software and services, which will continue to accelerate. Now as we've demonstrated over the last several years, we will continue to be laser-focused on disciplined capital allocation and ultimately delivering a leading and profitable EV footprint that provides us with the flexibility to scale by based on customer demand. Now Ford Pro. Ford Pro's results, they continue to accelerate, demonstrating the power of our portfolio. For this quarter, Ford Pro delivered a 28% increase in revenue driven by transit in our all-new Super Duty. EBIT more than doubled to $2.4 million, resulting in a margin of 3%. The significant year-over-year improvement EBIT reflects higher pricing and increased volume, both outstanding of the strength in commercial business. And we continue to be encouraged by our leading market position in the U.S. and Europe, our strong order banks, the upcoming launch of our new one Transit and a huge opportunity to grow software and services, and I'll talk more about this in a moment. But with over 450,000 customer subscriptions and with significant growth each quarter, this is a key pillar of our Ford Pro business. Ford Credit generated EBT of $309 million. Results were in line with our expectations, but down $550 million from a year ago, reflecting lower financing margin, nonrecurring credit loss reserve releases, residual value performance, all of which was already reflected in our full year outlook. Credit loss performance remains strong and below our historical average but is expected to increase and auction values remain robust, but are down from their peak in the first half of 2022. Before turning to our outlook, let me provide a little more text regarding some. In my mind, this is the real opportunity for value. We are already seeing sustained double-digit quarter-over-quarter growth in subscriptions across all of our business segments and most importantly, at gross margins of around 50%. And our next-generation digital platform will enable a step function change in capability, allowing us to scale and deliver value to both our retail and commercial customers even faster. Regarding our outlook, we now expect full year total company adjusted EBIT of $11 billion to $12 billion, primarily reflecting stronger net pricing in Ford Pro and Ford Blue with adjusted free cash flow of $6.5 billion to $7 billion and capital expenditures between $8 billion and $9 billion. Our guidance reflects headwinds, which include continued global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, higher industry-wide customer incentives and continued EV pricing pressure, increased warranty costs, lower past service exchange and costs associated with union agreements. And tailwinds include improvement in the supply chain and higher invite volume, all-new Super Duty and lower comps. Now turning to the segments. We now expect Ford Blue to deliver full year EBIT of about $8 billion. We expect higher volumes and stronger mix and more than offset any potential pricing headwind. The Model E to report an EBIT loss of around $4.5 billion, largely reflecting the present pricing environment, disciplined investment in new products and capacity and other costs. We also expect Ford Pro's EBIT to approach $8 billion with a significant year-over-year improvement driven by pricing and volume, including the benefit from the alley. And Ford Credit EBT is anticipated to be about $1.3 billion. So that wraps our prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of time to address what your minds. Thank you. And operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Jonas : Hey everybody. So first to Lynn's mother, Tony. I've actually never met you before, but I feel like I know you and I've heard so many stories from your daughter, not just about your humour and your amazing Puerto Rican cooking, but also for your values and how you've always stood up for what is right. So I just want to say God bless you, Tony. And just one question, Jim, thank you for showing the losses in Model E when nobody else in this industry has the courage to do so amongst the legacy peers. Losing $40,000 a unit on a model obviously can't continue. So is this something that you feel you can just grow your way out of? Or does something more radical need to change? And I'm thinking Audi and Volkswagen are turning to SAIC and Xing in China. There seems to be something a pivot going on in the industry where there's a willingness to work with competitors, your stuff with Tesla was your -- some of your peers seem to reluctantly follow you and you really showed leadership there. So I'm wondering if you could embrace or more of that collaborative approach to be -- remain relevant in EVs while also being more capital disciplined. Jim Farley : You're absolutely right. I would say, Adam, when Doug came on board and at the same time, we did a wider, especially Texas. And we really understood the BYD teardowns and even Changan, our partner in China. Our eyes were opened more than a year ago, and so we were fortunate that our new platform that non-semi are coming at a time when our traditional competitors have already designed and made their bets in the EV platforms. And I could tell you that, that moment was one of the biggest eye-opening moment in my personal career, where I realized we had completely changed our approach to platforms. The inverter technology, the efficiency in the system as -- of the vehicle, the massive complexity reduction and cost competitive reduction that we have to make in the second cycle products was just dramatic. The battery pack design that we see from our competitors is completely uncompetitive from what we saw and what we're now executing against. The gearboxes, the motors, how we thought about investment in braking systems and wiring systems, the diversity of battery chemistry like LFP, it was all just a moment when we all looked at each other and said, \"We have to go left to beat the -- and compete with these competitors that make a really on EV.\" And so we're executing that. And as John said, Adam, the other epiphany was for us, and thank God we have Pro because it's come to fruition is the enormous cost but importance of upgrading the electric architecture so we could be a winner in spending software to the vehicle. This decision by Ford and the type of products to bundle new, simpler, more energy-efficient platform that compete in segments where we have a great reputation that we can still conquest with very simple top hat engineering and add to it an advanced electrical architecture where we can win the war of shipping software to the vehicle was our bet, is our bet. And we like our bet, and we think it's competitive. In the meantime, we learned about battery scaling, which is not easy in Georgia. We learned about how to build 10,000, 20,000 unit a month batteries in one facility in high quality. We learned about the thermal propagation that will protect our brands over time, and I'm very optimistic. However, in a place like China, you only have to the local our local JV partners' platforms because they are the best in the world in certain segments. Maybe not for a full-size truck or a large trial cross-sell. But for some segments, it may be perfect for us. So we're not changing strategy at Ford. We've always been on that strategy, including China. Operator : The next question comes from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : I wanted to also ask a question about Model E. Just pushing out the EV targets, the volume targets make sense when we see contribution margins from volume being offset to additional price. But I was hoping that you might want to talk to us about kind of the longer term. What does it mean with regard to your 2026 targets? I'm glad to hear that you aren't fixated on two million units. What is your ability to adjust investment in structural costs when you have to make commitments to suppliers or to your infrastructure to be capable of hitting that? And are you still committed to the 8% margin target? A - John Lawler Yes. Rod, it's John. So we're not walking away from the 8% run rate in 2026. We've got several years to work that. It may look a little bit different than we shared at Capital Markets Day, but there's levers that we will. We don't necessarily have to spend at the same rate. Some of the battery factories to be flexible. The transition from components to electrical components is optional from a timing standpoint, so we can make those changes. And as Jim said, we've got the team working on that second generation of products, which is critical, and we have to work this in understanding whether pricing is settling and coming up with the right value equation. So we're not walking away from the 8% in '26, and we're going to continue to work on that. Jim Farley : As far as the volume trade-off, Rod, is interesting. The elasticity model that we're now building because of our high volume, we're at the middle part of the year this year. We filed about 120,000 EV. We're learning a lot about that elasticity between price and volume. It's actually not as different than ICE than we thought. So we have a lot of information that didn't have a year ago on the volume trade-off profit optimization, plus all the levers that John talked about on the 8%. Operator : The next question comes from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Dan Levy : Dan Levy with Barclays. Wanted to ask, Jim, on a comment you made earlier about plan to quadruple your number of hybrids. I don't remember what the base plan is, but just tying into maybe Rod's question, wondering what part of your push to decarbonize where there may be a little more flexibility and we lever. And how do hybrid factor in? Is the push on hybrids incremental? Was that always part of the plan? How are you looking at simply between hybrid and EVs? Jim Farley : Great question. I think how -- in general how we think about it is a year ago, two months ago, the industry thought of kind of this extreme hybrid and EV. What we now realize and being in markets like China, that there's an infinite number of decrease of electrification in between both of those. And the customers are very rational about buying an EREV versus a long-range PHAB versus a SERA hybrid for towing, customers are really acting pre rationally based on their duty cycle. So I would say a couple of years ago we decided to continue our hybrid investment in our heavier vehicles. And those hybrid systems are quite different, let's say, to Toyota Japanese OEM. And we have been surprised the popularity of hybrid systems for F-150. It's now north of 10% mix cost, and it's increasing. And what we've learned is that we have to tie. What the customer really likes is when we take a hybrid system that's more efficient in duty cycles, and then we add new capabilities battery like Pro Power Ford. We're seeing a lot in that combination of using the battery or something beyond just moving the vehicle. And that popularity, I mean we never thought we would be at 50% hybrid mix for Maverick. It was far beyond our expectation. And so we're just listening to the market. We believe that ICE customers, Blue customers don't want to be left behind. They want modern powertrains, and decarbonizing with them is just as attractive. That's one of the reasons why we separated the business because we want a Ford Blue and Pro. On Pro side, we're very lucky. We have a lot of great multi-energy platforms. So we have a lot of choices between electrification, partial electrification and ICE and the infinite number in between. The platforms are designed for that flexibility. So all I'm saying is you're going to see a lot more hybrid systems from us, but don't think of them in the traditional sense of an escape hybrid or Prius. They're probably going to come to light differently than the people think, and customers like that. Dan Levy : Great. And are there other levers in terms of flexibility on the plan where some elements can be deferred, again, just a function of, like you said, listening to the market? Jim Farley : You mean capital deployment to EVs? Or can you be more specific? Dan Levy : Capital deployment to EV and program development reuse. I mean one of your competitors earlier this week announced that one of their programs, which expected to cease, was being refreshed and with a function of sort of reuse of capital. So are there things you can do? Yes. Jim Farley : I see. So we don't -- I want to be really clear about this. You -- all of you haven't yet seen our second cycle EV strategy or even the third cycle that we're working on, and I'm not going to tell our competitors about that right now. But I will tell you that it's very important to know that Ford strategy is not to build compliant vehicles that are very affordable for acquisition cost but lose lots of money. That's not our strategy when it comes to electrification. Our strategy is to make 8% margin irregardless of the price point, and we're going to allocate capital along those lines. So the pressure we're in ourselves is that we -- in future segments, we execute the product with rural efficiency and simplicity, and we upgrade the electric architecture for lots of software revenue and profits with great margins for all of our electric and our hybrid vehicles. And they all have to stand on their own in the segment report, and you will see all those results transparently. We don't create greenhouse grass credits between our businesses. We used to allocate capital. It was like $5,000 a vehicle. We're done. We're done with that. We don't play games like that. That's why we created these segments. And if we have a low-cost vehicle like some of our competitors have, it's not going to be a compliance set. It's on a vehicle that we convince ourselves we can make 8%. Maybe a lot of that is in software because we do need to build this installed base. I hope that's clear what our top-of-the-house strategy is and maybe how it's different than others. Operator : The next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Just one really quick follow-up there, Jim. When you're talking about hybrids, are you talking about plug-in hybrids or hybrids that will qualify for the $7,500 IRA credit just that they have batteries that are large enough? I just wanted to make sure we understand that. Jim Farley : Yes. I want to make it really clear. The term hybrid is going to -- in our industry going to get our company. Hybrid could be a serial hybrid. It just means a motor powers batteries. It could be a hybrid in the traditional sense that like the F-150 hybrid or the -- and the hybrids I'm referring to are not plug-in hybrids. They are vehicles without a plug. Operator : The next question comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : My question, which is around the outlook for the bigger loss of Model E segment this year. And I guess the changed guidance reflects greater price competition. But as some portion of the outlook for a bigger loss may be driven in part also by a conscious decision to reinvest some of the higher-than-expected profit that Pro and Blue back into the business, the accelerating electric vehicle development or other EV-related capabilities. And with regard to that breakeven on a contribution margin target for first-generation EDs, can investors now expect that at some point in 2024? And then finally here, just given the reiteration of the 8% EV target in '26, could you maybe help us some more with the factors that continue to give you confidence in that target? Is it related at all to Jim's comments at the start of the call for maybe taking some time for the winners in the EV market to be sorted from the losers, reflecting your expectation that by 2026, the number of market participants could be less. And so therefore, pricing competition more rational? Or is the confidence more -- factors under your control that give you that confidence, leaning more on vertical integration and other levers that you might have identified, et cetera? John Lawler : Yes, Ryan. I think that in the absence of that question highlights the complexity and all the levers that we have to work with here, and so what I would say is we haven't changed our plan. What changed is that the adoption we're seeing with -- now that we've moved into early majority and the price premium of EVs has come off or normalized more quickly than we expected, and so that's impacting the profitability right now. But we're continuing to work through all of those levers as we build out the second generation of vehicles. And that path, that bridge that we had talked about, we had thought that prices would come down. It's sooner than we had thought. And it might be a little bit deeper than we had thought. But also as we get more and more confidence and gain more and more confidence in the products that Doug is creating and the combination of that product, both the physical hardware and the software and the experience and the ability to execute a completely optimized system of higher vehicle, that's giving us confidence in our ability to move towards a sustainably profitable segment in EV, starting with our second generation. So we're not walking away from that 8% target. Jim Farley : And I really want to mention something that I'm compelled to mention, which is in the U.S. right now, I don't know, 7% to 8% depending on the month. The intention by still 30% to 50%. There are plenty of consumers. The issue is price to pay has come down, but it's very, very lumpy. It's not consistent across all segments. So one of the most important levers that John is referring to is what segment we compete in with our second-generation products. That's why I said clearly that we are so thankful we did not bet on 2-row crossovers. We have bet on segments that we know deeply, deeply, deeply. And we now know what we know, and we can't unlearn what we learned from the per EV companies on cost and complexity. And now we have touted a company like Doug, where we're shipping almost 0.5 million software, that many software subscribers. So there is real demand for these customers based on duty cycle. It's up to us to get those second site products and doing the cost reductions in the meantime. And I think our strategy, the segments we compete, which is not visible to see yet, I think it's going to really differentiate Ford. John Lawler : All right. One thing, Jim. One of the other things that we are looking at, this is the future and this is about an installed base, and so we're also looking at these customers today in the acquisition. We know that once you bring them in, they're more loyal. We think about what the retention rates will be over second vehicle or a third vehicle. They come down over time. We also think about it from a modest software attach rate to these vehicles. And we very carefully look at the present value of that. And is it still positive given the acquisition cost of these customers to invest in the row? And so we watch that very closely. And we talked about that with the team. I'm not going to give you the specific numbers, but that's what we're thinking about. And I can tell you, if we get to the point where that lifetime customer value is there an acquisition cost, that's what we said. We won't acquire customers with any cost, and we know where those lines are for. And so that's one of the other things that we're using -- we're looking at this as we invest in our future. Operator : The next question comes from Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Philippe Houchois : I hear what you're saying, Jim, and it's very interesting. It makes perfect sense. But it seems now like compared to a few weeks ago, we saw you in Detroit, this is -- it's not a turnaround. It's not about, but it's quite -- it's like you had relation in BEV. And it seems like the last few weeks, I've shaken that contingents quite a lot. And I'm just trying to understand how much of this is a reaction to a more difficult environment to understand and how much is strategic. And you should have been strategic a while back because I look at competitors, whether it's Toyota or BMW, you have taken a more careful approach about this transition, the complexity and have a bit more flexibility. So just to sense the change of mood. Part of the question, if I do a simple math, the loss per car in Pro was about $32,000. There were 12,000 EVs -- sorry, in E. There were 12,000 EVs in Pro. Does it mean that there's a loss of about $250 million booked in Pro, which means that we've added, the margin will be even higher, something like 18%. John Lawler : Yes. Just one thing. I understand I appreciate the math and doing the math that way. And you look at it, wow, it's a big number. You have to remember that there's a lot of investment going to ramp and put the footprint in as well that these vehicles are carrying. And we're -- we added quite a bit of capacity to make it work, and so we have to think about it that way as well. We have to break it into what's the contribution margin, what's the gross profit, how much are you investing for the future so that we can scale and grow this business because we know EVs are coming. It's not like it's a question we're not going to have EV. So we can do the math that way, but I'm not sure it's the right way to think about how we're approaching this business because there is a lot of upfront cost to invest in that footprint so that we can grow. And remember, we're working on our second generation and our third-generation vehicles. That has cost as well. So to attach all of it just to these vehicles, I don't think it's quite the right way to be thinking about that as we move forward, respectfully. Jim Farley : On the -- I'm not sure, but I think you're going referring to the Lighting price decrease, and I want to be really clear. We built about 24,000 electric vehicles at Ford in the first quarter. Our target for the quarter four is $100,000. That's four times. The ramp on F-150 in September is really significant. We always knew that we had to build an order bank that looked nothing like the original F-150 Lightning order bank because our production is tripling. And that's really critical for us strategically because we have a second cycle product coming, and it's going to be really profitable, and so that's really important to understand. We didn't cut the price the F-150 $100,000 to create an order bank for our current production rate. It's for a tripling. And oh, by the way, the F-150 price after the $10,000 decline is still above its launch price. Operator : The last question today comes from Jim Picariello with BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead. Jim Picariello : Just looking at the guidance for Blue, now at $8 billion for the year. There's almost a $2 billion step-down, right, first half to second half. Can you just unpack what the key bridge items -- are there to the sequential step-down? I mean I know there's obvious sensitivity around what could be baked in for the UAW contract impact. But beyond this, how should we be thinking about for Blue volumes, pricing? Any other factors that stand out for the second half? John Lawler : Yes. Thanks. So when you look at that for Blue on a half-over-half basis, we -- pricing held up much better than we thought through the second quarter, but we do have planned in the second half as we continue to increase volumes in Blue that we will see some pricing pressure there. So we see that happening as we walk through. We do have in the second half the ratification, which we see when we get to a new contract. And remember, for us, all of that is in our quarter, in our fourth quarter. We don't amortize that. We take it as a full charge in the quarter. And then we're also seeing some inflationary pressures. And we saw that in the quarter as well, we see that going through the second half, primarily around warranty, and that's with the costs that we're seeing come through the dealers. So they're increasing their costs and warranty for the repairs. Their labor rates, et cetera, have gone up with inflation. And then the other thing we're seeing across the board, we saw it in the second quarter, but we see it through this quarter as well, is the cost we're seeing right freight costs. Although some of the rates are coming down. We're seeing constraints overseas. We're seeing rail constraints. So we're generally seeing constraints around freight, and that's driving up costs as well there. So that's the combination of the puts and takes for Blue as we go our half over half.

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, Gary. Welcome to Ford Motor Company\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO; John Lawler, Chief Financial Officer; and Peter Stern, President, Ford Integrated Services. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit. Today\u2019s discussions include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.forward.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause results to differ are included on Page 20. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year over year, company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim. Jim Farley : Thank you, Lynn. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I wanted to start by thanking the Ford team who worked tirelessly and creatively over the past several months to reach a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers. I\u2019m so pleased for our employees. This week, I was able to visit each of the struck plants. I was impressed by their preparation for start-up, and the feeling I got is people just want to get back to work. Once the deal is ratified, we will provide all of you a deeper look at the contract and its impact on our business. Right now, we\u2019re focused on restarting three important assembly plants, calling back more than 20,000 Ford employees to work, supporting our suppliers as they restart, and shipping lots of Super Duties, Explorers, and Broncos to our customers. It\u2019s been a challenging situation, for sure. Matter of fact, our business is never short of challenges, especially right now with the evolution of the EV market and new global competitors from China, as well as the technology disruptions. But I am more excited and motivated than ever. Our team is making tremendous progress every day toward building a Ford that thrives at the intersection of fantastic and iconic vehicles, terrific brands, and especially software and services. We are deep into the development of our future software platforms, which provide the foundation for rapid innovation and a profitable new software and services business and constantly improving experiences for our customers. We believe Ford+ is the right strategy to win in this constantly evolving industry transformation. We\u2019re building a more dynamic and less cyclical company, and we are nowhere near peak profitability. We have the right team and talent, and we are in the process of building a culture of excellence and execution. In a moment, John will detail the quarter, which I would call mixed. The strength of our products and revenues and businesses defined definitely came through in our results. But at the same time, we were never negatively impacted by the strike, and our cost and quality remain a drag on our business. Now, last week, we made some important leadership changes. Kumar Galhotra as COO will now control the key levers for transformative change in our industrial system, powertrain, ICE, and hybrid products, vehicle hardware engineering, cycle plan, quality, supply chain, and manufacturing, and work in tandem, of course, with Doug Field, chief EV, digital, and design officer, to move us forward. I believe this will accelerate our progress on cost and quality, and I hope we get into that in the Q&A. These are my top two priorities. Overall, we see \u2013 we are seeing the clear benefits of creating three distinct growth businesses now with Ford Blue, Model e, and Pro. The story of Ford Blue comes down to product strength. Incredibly strong brands like Mustang and Bronco and Raptor, they have durable pricing power and real choice between gas and hybrid. Ford is America\u2019s best-selling brand now through three quarters, even with the effects of the strike, and we have a wave of new products coming in the next few months, the new F-150, the Ranger, a brand-new Explorer, and Expedition and Navigator. In fact, close to 60% of our volume and revenues in the U.S. will be new and refreshed next year. I am so thankful we have kept our foot on the gas to freshen our ICE and HEV products as we enter a changing market. In Europe, we bring out new versions of Puma and Kuga or high-volume gas and hybrid SUVs, and the Ranger pickup and our Everest SUV that\u2019s based on it continued to gain share in international markets. So, bottom line, Ford Blue will be strong and a growing business for years to come. We also remain bullish on Model e and our EV future, but clearly, the market is moving \u2013 is a moving target. I\u2019m optimistic because customers are smart and are rational, and for many of them, EVs are a great choice. I\u2019ve been spending a ton of time in our product development center with both Doug Field and Alan Clarke, and you should see the Gen 2 and Gen 3 EVs we\u2019re working on. Our Gen 2 all-new full-size pickup truck, for example, is one of the most thrilling vehicles I have ever seen in my career. Let me be specific. Stunning performance like no truck has ever performed, building unexpected innovation for truck customers far beyond the normal truck attributes, a super flexible cabin that feels like a lounge or a tiny office. Take the wheels off this truck, and it\u2019s still a mind-blowing product and a digital experience that totally is immersive and personalized. I\u2019d take this truck seven days of the week over a Cybertruck. A great product is not enough in the EV business anymore. We have to be totally competitive on cost. Tesla actually gave us a huge gift with a laser-focus on cost and scaling the Model Y. They set the standard, and we are now making real progress on our second- and third-cycle EVs that are in the midst of being developed today as we get closer to the introduction. While our Gen 2 EVs were targeting to deliver an EBIT margin comparable to ICE by 2026, the dynamic changes in the market, pricing, adoption rates, regulations are forcing us to further reduce the cost of our EVs. The key levers to deliver this competitive cost structure are scaling, vertical integration, and batteries. So, let\u2019s double-click on each of these three. On scaling, this is much more than building new facilities or scaling high-quality batteries or thermal propagation. We\u2019re leveraging digital prognostic capabilities in our manufacturing lines to improve quality. We are also reducing complexity, and we are optimizing our vehicle design and engineering for manufacturability. Yep, we\u2019re designing these vehicles for our manufacturing team. On vertical integration, this is the most fundamental change. We are insourcing batteries, inverters, scaling production of our drive units and gearboxes, and designing and producing unit castings in-house at Ford. In addition, on our next-generation utility vehicles, vertical integration will increase by nearly 50%. This level of integration, along with the new zonal electric architecture and designing in-house modules and battery cell to structure, will allow us to significantly reduce material cost. Now, none of this will be easy, and it has some risk, and you\u2019ve seen our competitors struggle as they build out and ramp up these capabilities. So, we are so glad we started years ago on this journey. And finally, batteries. They\u2019re the single biggest cost component of any EV. Our more energy-efficient Gen 2 products, we use extreme aero to get the very smallest batteries possible for competitive range. And with our LFP batteries, we\u2019ll have the lowest or one of the lowest-cost batteries assembled in the U.S. Our overall EV priorities are very clear, disciplined capital allocation and investment that drives profitable, high-returning and enduring EV business, and we will constantly balance growth, scale, and profitability. These great EVs will be paired with modern shopping and buying experiences that are transparent or have non-negotiated pricing and a streamlined checkout and delivery that will come to life early in 2024. And this is also a significant cost reduction. I saved Ford Pro for the last because it\u2019s a massive driver of Ford\u2019s growth and profitability. Our competitors seem to be trying to cut and paste our strategy, but the reality is the moats we\u2019ve built over many decades for our Pro business won\u2019t be easy to cross. The network of literally thousands of local outfitters across Europe, North America, and China and customer-driven engineering we have for vehicles like F-Series and Transit is formidable across all those regions. Our commercial order banks are healthy. This may be a surprise to everyone. We see a large backlog of infrastructure projects. Thank you, 5G and roadworks. And we have very loyal customers. Fleet orders, for example, for the 2024 Super Duty are coming in faster than last year\u2019s orders, and we expect strong demand to continue as more customers recognize what Ford has to offer in total. In addition to the new Super Duty, we are preparing to launch the new Transit Custom in Europe. Think of this product as a Super Duty for Europe. It\u2019s a best-selling vehicle in the UK, not the best-selling commercial vehicle, the best-selling vehicle and the leading one-ton van in Europe. And it\u2019s a key profit pillar for Europe and one of the reasons why we stayed there. When it comes to software and services, Ford Pro is the tip of our digital spear. Customers know and trust our vehicles, of course. And we\u2019re building on this with software-driven services that provide businesses with data insights, vehicle access, even vehicle control, and functionality. This helps them drive productivity and efficiency in their fleet operations. And I\u2019ve asked Ted Cannis to also lead our large and profitable aftersales business. His focus will increase our post-warranty service business and profitability. He\u2019s already adding mobile service capability and delivering an effortless experience to both commercial and retail customers. There is so much upside in this aftersales, parts, repair, and collision business, especially with Ted leading it and for Ford Pro. I want to briefly touch on China where our strategy to turn our business around is gaining traction. The restructuring of our EV business there is nearly complete, and the internal combustion engine business is now profitable. We are now expanding China\u2019s role to a profitable export hub, including Ford Pro. We\u2019ve already exported a record number of vehicles so far from China to markets like Mexico, South America, and Asia. There is so much more opportunity ahead for us. Yes, the China market is extremely competitive in the middle, but Ford can succeed by staying asset-light, partnering where it makes sense, and competing in very narrow segments where we can clearly win like commercial vehicles, off-road vehicles, large SUVs, and Lincoln. Finally, I\u2019m so pleased to have Peter Stern on today to share more about our newly formed Ford Integrated Services, which will create and market valuable software-enabled customer experiences across Blue, e, and Pro. Now, this is transformational because the cornerstone of Ford+, the plus in our plan, is creating incredible customer services and experiences enabled by not just hardware but software. There\u2019s simply no one in the world better able than Peter, who is the driving force behind services at Apple, to build this strategically vital business for us. Peter, over to you. Peter Stern : Thanks, Jim. I\u2019ve spent my career creating new customer experiences and launching businesses at the intersection of hardware, software, and services. And I came to Ford because this company puts that kind of innovation at the center of its long-term strategy. As you said, it\u2019s literally the plus in Ford+. Now, over two months in, I\u2019m even more excited to be here and to be part of this exceptional team that\u2019s working together to bring the Ford+ plan to life for our customers, employees, and shareholders. Our vision for integrated services is to transform every aspect of the Ford customer experience across our three segments. We\u2019re making our vehicles even more connected, convenient, productive, secure, and exhilarating. Over the past couple of months, we\u2019ve identified a portfolio of services that will improve our customers\u2019 lives and businesses by building on our industry-leading early successes with Ford Pro Intelligence and BlueCruise. This portfolio will elevate the Ford brand and introduce us to millions of new customers who may have never considered a Ford before. It will drive new high margin, cyclical recurring revenue streams for Ford and result in stronger relationships with our customers. And we\u2019ll do this while adhering to the values that distinguish Ford from our competitors, like our respect for customer privacy, safety, and very importantly, choice. Whether you choose to add our services or not, you\u2019ll have an amazing vehicle. Our momentum around software and services is building fast. Here are three examples. First, Ford Pro Intelligence builds on Ford\u2019s industry-leading share in the commercial vehicle space by making the people who drive our vehicles even more productive and by reducing total cost of ownership. Adoption of vehicle telematics, fleet management, and charging optimization were up 20% sequentially in the third quarter, and our average revenue per subscription was up nearly 10% over the past six months, both contributing to strong revenue growth. And we\u2019re still in the early stages of our rollout. We ended the quarter with 476,000 paid subscriptions for our commercial solutions, a jump of nearly 50% year over year. And we have an ambitious product road map for Pro. For example, over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll launch the Ford Pro dashcam. This product uses machine vision and in-vehicle intelligence to detect in-cab and on-road events, simplify fleet operations, and encourage safer driving. While we\u2019re still early in our journey, Pro Intelligence is an area that we\u2019ll continue to expand and drive value for both our customers and Ford. Second, in September, we announced that the 2024 F-150 will be the first vehicle available in North America with Ford Stolen Vehicle Services. This is a fully integrated theft prevention and recovery service that provides unique features like inclination and movement alerts. So, you get notified if your truck is jacked up or moved while the engine is off. And third, BlueCruise is one of the most consequential consumer applications of artificial intelligence in the world today. Some of you experienced our last version at Capital Markets Day. If you haven\u2019t felt what it\u2019s like to take your hands off the wheel and your foot off the gas and let BlueCruise take over steering, acceleration, and braking, please visit a Ford dealer, so we can demonstrate it. Launch to date, our vehicles have been driven hands-free for 125 million miles. That\u2019s the equivalent of 500 trips to the moon, which I imagine would be largely hands-free as well. Real-world driving data from Mustang Mach-E vehicles using BlueCruise shows a more than 10 times reduction in lane departures compared with unassisted driving. And for the second time in a row, BlueCruise was just rated the best hands-free system on the market, and this was based on BlueCruise 1.0. BlueCruise 1.3 is rolling out now and adds lane change support and other refinements that keep drivers in hands-free mode, on average, five times longer than version 1.0. Our technology team, led by my partner, Doug Field, is the best in the business, and BlueCruise is the proof. Despite these encouraging successes, what we\u2019re about to do in Integrated Services won\u2019t be easy. Our multi-year playbook depends on our next-generation vehicles that are even more connected. We must also round out our customer-centric portfolio of services and evolve our customer relationship management technologies. Our dealers are a key competitive advantage for Ford, and with them, we need to make it easier to become and stay a services customer. We need to build a relationship centered around the customer, not the vehicle, because in the services space, the sale of the vehicle should be the beginning of a beautiful long-term relationship with our customers. And that necessitates not only new people, processes, and technologies but also new measures of success. So, as we progress in our services evolution, you\u2019re going to hear us talk about key metrics like addressable units in operation, attach rates, and average revenue per subscription. And as we move each of these levers in the context of a low-variable cost, high-margin service business, it will have a multiplicative effect on profits. There\u2019s incredible value to be unlocked here for our customers and for Ford, and I\u2019m proud to be a part of the team making that happen during this pivotal moment in our history. John, over to you. John Lawler : Thanks, Peter. Through the first three quarters, we delivered 9.4 billion in adjusted EBIT, a strong result that is indicative of our underlying run rate of the business. Now, given our year-to-date performance, we were on track to comfortably deliver our full-year adjusted EBIT guidance of 11 billion to 12 billion. With that said, the UAW strike created significant uncertainty regarding our full-year results, and even though we have reached a tentative agreement and our employees are starting to return to work, we have withdrawn our guidance for the year. This is in part because of the continued disruption in the industry with the ongoing strikes, the follow-on impact to our shared supply base, the ramp up of production in our plants and at our supplier partners, as well as other ancillary effects. And to provide some context, in the third quarter, the strike had an EBIT impact of roughly $100 million, and so far, the strike has trimmed about 80,000 units from our plant. This would reduce 2023 EBIT by roughly 1.3 billion. Once we have a ratified agreement and begin to ramp operations, we will be in a better position to update you on our full-year guidance. So, let me now turn to our third-quarter results, which was once again \u2013 it once again showed our Ford+ plan in action and the benefits of our diversified portfolio. Our leading Pro business and resilient ICE and hybrid products continue to deliver solid results that more than offset the investments we are making in our EV future. Our revenue remains strong, up 11%, reflecting a product lineup that resonates with customers, driving higher net pricing that remains resilient. Whole sales were flat, dampened by supply constraints affecting both F-Series and Transit production, additional unit holds for quality assurance, and the first UAW work stoppage for Ford in almost 50 years. Adjusted EBIT in the quarter was 2.2 billion with a margin of 5%. Both improved year over year. However, costs increased, underscoring the fact that we still have more work to do, especially on warranty expense and material cost. Adjusted free cash flow was 1.2 billion in the quarter, down year over year, driven by unfavorable working capital. Through the first nine months, we generated 4.8 million of adjusted free cash flow resulting in a conversion rate of 51%, in line with our target range. Our disciplined capital allocation continues to drive strong free cash flow, which will be critical as we adjust our spending to match the pace of EV adoption. We ended the quarter with over 29 billion in cash and 50 billion in liquidity, one of our strongest quarters ever, and this includes the new 4 billion contingent liquidity facility we put in place in August to help withstand uncertainties in the present environment. Now, turning to our customer-focused segments. Ford Pro generated EBIT of 1.7 billion and delivered a strong double-digit margin of 12%. Both metrics improved, driven by our Super Duty and Transit franchises that helped deliver a 16% improvement in revenue that\u2019s reflecting strong demand and continued pricing power. In addition, we are launching a new version of our flagship product in Europe, the Transit Custom, which, along with the new Super Duty and F-150, will give Pro its freshest vehicle lineup in years. We also continue to see strong growth in both our new software subscriptions and mobile repair orders, up roughly 50% and 200%, respectively, for the quarter. Regarding Model e, our EV start-up incurred 1.3 billion of losses in the quarter, reflecting continued investment in our next-generation products and a more challenging market for our Gen 1 products. Given the dynamic EV environment, we are being judicious about our production and adjusting future capacity to better match market demand. For example, we have taken out some Mustang Mach-E production, and we are also slowing down several investments, including making a decision with SK On to delay the second BlueOval SK JV battery plant in Kentucky. And we have also said we are evaluating our BlueOval Battery Park Michigan plant to determine the best path forward. In fact, all told, we have pushed about 12 billion of EV spend, which includes CapEx, direct investment, and expense. The ultimate success of our EV transition will be driven by our Gen 2 and Gen 3 products, which will be cost-optimized and guided by the learnings of our first-generation vehicles that are currently in the market. Turning to Ford Blue. In the third quarter, we delivered EBIT of 1.7 billion, up 300 million, driven by lower commodity costs and higher net pricing that more than offset higher warranty costs. The higher warranty was driven by recalls and higher per unit repair costs due to inflation. Importantly, Blue continues to be profitable in all regions with a strong, fresh portfolio poised for continued global success. Hybrids also continue to be a success, a strategy we\u2019ve had in place now for almost two decades. We are the clear leader of the hybrid pickup truck segment in the U.S, thanks to Maverick and F-150. We expect to extend its lead next year when we introduce our refreshed 2024 F-150 with more advanced technologies. The F-150 Powerboost hybrid not only offers a 25% improvement in CO2 emissions, but on average, they have more \u2013 they are more profitable than our highest-volume gas powertrains. And hybrids aren\u2019t just limited to North America as we are launching a Ranger for Europe and IMG next year. Ford Credit generated EBIT of 358 million. As expected, our results were down year over year, reflecting lower lease residuals and financing margin and the non-reoccurrence of derivatives market valuation gains. Credit loss performance remains strong and below our historical average but continues to normalize. Auction values remain strong but are down sequentially, in line with our expectations. Finally, turning to software and services. We continue to see sustained quarter-over-quarter growth in subscriptions across all our business segments and, most importantly, at gross margins of around 50%. And our next-generation digital platform will enable a step function change in capability, allowing us to scale and deliver value to both our retail and commercial customers even faster. And as Peter highlighted, as we continue to build out our capabilities here, we expect it to be a significant source of future value creation. In closing, there\u2019s obviously a tremendous amount going on in our business, but I\u2019m confident in our Ford+ plan and the underlying run rate of our business. So, that wraps up our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll use the balance of the time to address what\u2019s on your minds. Thank you, and operator, please open the line for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question today is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Jonas : Thanks, everybody. So, John, I know you pushed out the 12 billion of the direct and capital investment and other expenditure on EVs, but I guess I\u2019m saying \u2013 I\u2019m interpreting that as just temporary, that you still plan on spending it. So, my question is, how long can you keep allocating 10 billion a year, round number, to EVs? John Lawler : Yes. So, Adam, we\u2019re going to match demand and capital needed to meet that demand. You know, the first step here is given the flatter growth curve that we\u2019re seeing relative to what the industry expected and we expected, we\u2019ve made this decision to push out 12 billion of capital expenditures, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019ll actually go ahead and pull the trigger on it if we don\u2019t need to. And we\u2019re going to look at the overall EV business and be balanced about that. There\u2019s a lot that\u2019s going to change between now, in \u201826, and \u201830, and we\u2019re going to adjust appropriately. So, it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to adjust as we move and how that business develops, and we\u2019ll adjust that capital allocation appropriately. And we\u2019ll change our strategy and make different decisions as well. And one of the other things I\u2019d say is that \u2013 well, I\u2019ll pass it over to Jim because Jim has something he wants to say. Jim Farley : Hey, Adam, thank you for your question. I just want to emphasize the importance of our Gen 2 and Gen 3 products because they\u2019re very transformation in our profitability in EV. You know, we\u2019ve learned a lot in Gen 1. We\u2019ve reduced the material costs. We\u2019ve got the learning loop on the software. We learned how to scale batteries. We have the LFP battery now. We\u2019re starting to ship to customers, but there\u2019s only so much we can do on Gen 1. On Gen 2, I said \u2013 as I said, we have a totally different approach from aero vertical integration designed for manufacturability. And there\u2019s a lot of other things we can do beyond allocating less capital to battery plants, for example. We\u2019ve learned a lot about derivatives like rally. We\u2019re going to push services a lot more like Level 2+, Level 3 autonomy. And we really plan on even redesign or improving the scale of a components by working with other companies. And the other big breakthrough is going to be which we\u2019re designing in parallel the Gen 3 products where we use the battery as a structural member of the vehicle. We go to low-cost sourcing, go to smaller vehicles. We maximize unit casting even more than we are and radical cost reduction in our distribution. I think the other thing that\u2019s important to understand about Ford\u2019s strategy on EVs is Pro. We actually followed a very different strategy for Pro using a multi-energy platform. So, we didn\u2019t bet on pure electric vehicles for Transit, for example, and we\u2019re now launching the Transit Custom in Europe, and that has diesel gas, and it will have eventually hybrid and pure electric. That\u2019s a very different bet in our Pro. We\u2019re even starting to export Pro vehicles from China to develop markets around the world that are pure electric. And that part won\u2019t change our product strategy. Adam Jonas : Appreciate that, Jim. Maybe just a follow-up. On hybrids, you pointed out in the prepared remarks the growth there, and I think you\u2019ve made comments that technology is something you want to lean in on more as a transition. Not that you won\u2019t continue to sell your Gen 1 EVs, but that there is just real demand for hybrids. Can you refresh us as you kind of turn that dial back up on hybrids categorically, how that \u2013 how the margins on those products might compare to your ICE \u2013 your normal ICE margins? Is it accretive? Is it kind of in the ballpark? I didn\u2019t know if there was any kind of sacrifice or gap there between hybrid and the normal pure ICE. Thanks. John Lawler : Yes. You want me to jump in, Jim? Jim Farley : Yes. John Lawler : There\u2019s added costs as you\u2019d expect for the battery and the motors, etc. But if you look at \u2013 let\u2019s just take F-Series, for example. If you take the hybrid on average, they have a higher margin than our highest-volume gas versions because of the mix and what we have in the vehicle and the pricing we can get for the hybrid technology and the fuel efficiency that comes along with that. And one of the things we learned about hybrid, because we\u2019re executing very differently than our first-gen hybrids, is we have Pro power on board. We have a lot of other attributes that people are willing to pay for, like F-150 powering a jobsite or your house as back up energy. That\u2019s another advantage of having those batteries that maybe some of our competitors haven\u2019t had the same pricing power. The F-150 now, a hybrid, is up 40% year over year, and we think the new F-150 new hybrid will be 20% mix, and it may be the best-selling hybrid in the United States. So, our hybrid strategy is a little different than our competitors because the work cycle for our products are different, but hybrid has a really big place. We\u2019re trying to challenge ourselves, Adam, to execute hybrids, so they do more than just propel the vehicle for pricing power. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Jim. Thanks, John. Operator : The next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good afternoon, guys. Just a first question, Jim, on warranty and an accelerated \u2013 sort of headwind, on a year-over-year basis, accelerated a bit in the quarter. But if I look at the full-year numbers, even if we added back this \u2013 I think it\u2019s Slide 32. If we added back the 1.7 billion on warranty to the 9.4 billion in EBIT you\u2019ve done year to date, you\u2019d already even be in your range in the first three quarters of the 11 billion to 12 billion in EBIT you\u2019d been talking about before. So, I mean, it\u2019s a major issue here for the numbers and results in cash flow. What\u2019s going on, and how are you going to get a handle on this and reverse this hopefully in the next year or two? John Lawler : Yes. So, Adam, that\u2019s exactly right. One of the things we\u2019re \u2013 sorry, John. One of the things we\u2019re seeing is that it\u2019s not just the quality issues which are an important piece of this, and I think Jim wants to comment on that. But we\u2019re also seeing tremendous inflation from the dealers on the repair costs. And that\u2019s driving quite a bit of it. If you look at the increase that we had in the quarter for the warranty on a year over year, the 1.2 billion, and say that about 300 million of that was inflationary costs and roughly 900 million was the issue with warranties. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing there. And the issue around the quality that\u2019s something that Jim\u2019s going to be going to cover here. Jim Farley : Hey, John, again, thanks for your question. I want to slow it down a little bit and explain kind of our operational headwinds, not just quality but cost as well, and give a little bit of context and maybe highlight some of the stuff we\u2019ve done but the work we have to do. A couple of years ago, when we started as a management team, the team that\u2019s doing cost and quality is same team, and we have a lot of revenue power in the company. But we also have a lot of technology, and that technology that we rolled out like cameras before our competitors, it puts a huge burden on that electric architecture with a lot of extra modules and software. We definitely had the largest complexity customer-facing of any brand, and we also ran the business on products instead of platforms and systems. Our engineers and supply chain team did not have competitive tools like IT systems and parts release IT. We weren\u2019t cooperating with the suppliers the right way on cost reduction. We kind of negotiated them every year, but we weren\u2019t really getting into redesigning the parts and getting the complexity out of the suppliers\u2019 manufacturing system. We didn\u2019t really use a lot of strategic sourcing. So, we had a lot of concentration, our suppliers, and lack of leverage. We had inconsistent application within our manufacturing system for our QOS. So, some plants were fantastic like in China and Mexico. All the plants were completely uncompetitive and run differently. And we traveled hopefully on a lot of the launches. The gateways, we would have some issues, and the team had, kind of a hero mentality to try to close them out at the end of the launch, and we would get in trouble. I\u2019m really proud of the progress we made like in the last 18 months, but it\u2019s maybe just the tip above the water and the low-lying fruit. We now have to get after that systematic issue and those issues that I mentioned. On complexity, we have reduced the new F-Series from 1.4 billion combinations to less than 1,000. And on our new SUVs, we reduced the customer-facing complexity by over 90%. Our QOS execution is getting better. We\u2019re about 10% improvement in our problems at three months in service, which is a lot of progress for North America. So, the initial quality is getting better. We now have the talent, both the expertise but also the execution talent. We\u2019re now starting to strategically source our EV components, which we now can apply to our ICE business. I\u2019m really proud of the launch progress we made. We\u2019re now seeing launch spikes we\u2019ve never seen in a decade at Ford. We are slowing down those launches, and in the case of Super Duty, its cost is $1 billion, but it was the right trade because it prevents a lot of recalls and issues down the road for the company. And we have made progress on material. We have billions of dollars of opportunity next year, but we have to deliver and release the parts, and I\u2019m very confident that Kumar\u2019s new organization will be able to really get after the part of the iceberg that\u2019s below the water. That\u2019s been a problem at Ford for decades. Thank you for asking your question, and I just wanted to take a little extra time to give the full context. John Murphy : That\u2019s great. Maybe I\u2019ll just sneak in one follow-up. You know, EV demand is not materializing quite as robustly as we were expecting this year. Pricing is a little bit down. Costs are going to be up with labor. So, I mean, as you mentioned, EVs are going to become more challenging going forward. But when you think about like a program or a product like the Explorer that we have, at least in car, where it\u2019s launching in calendar year \u201825 as a model year \u201826, and you might disagree or agree with that, but that product is coming at some point soon. That was an EV variant and an ICE variant we had and we were expecting, and it would have been sort of an expectation that maybe you would have crossed out that ICE variant and just had an EV six months ago. But now, actually, things have switched in the other direction. You might actually cross out the EV and just keep the ICE. I mean, how are you making these decisions right now with sort of these tectonic shifts going on? I mean, there\u2019s data. There\u2019s consumer groups and all sorts of stuff, but they\u2019re incredibly difficult and impactful decisions that you have to make. What is the process, Jim, that you\u2019re going through on these powertrain decisions as you\u2019re going through the product launches over the coming years in planning? Jim Farley : Yes, got it. So, things are changing. You know, EVs are still in high demand. It\u2019s just, as you said, the pricing is much lower, and there\u2019s a lot of overcapacity in the middle of the market. For us, I think we\u2019re \u2013 our EV strategy and our ICE strategy is to go after customers we know really well. And so, on our ICE and hybrids, very much of a loyalty target. And in the case of EVs, many of the same segments, but a conquest strategy. And I would say we feel very confident on that strategy because Ford is \u2013 has a great reputation in those segments like full-size truck or pickups or vans, commercial vehicles or three-row crossovers, but our products are not substitutional because the customers who we\u2019re going after are different, but they are the same segment. So, we know the use cycle really well, but the innovation will be pointing in different things. The F-150, I think, is probably the best example at Ford because we have world-class ICE. We have a hybrid that\u2019ll probably be 20% mix. And then we have lightning and the next-generation lightning that we\u2019re working on right now. And when you compare the ICE, the hybrid F-150 to the EV F-150, you will be surprised at how much more conquest the vehicle is executed. And we believe that innovation will give us pricing power for those EV conquest customers. The first generation has helped us there, but I think that\u2019s our strategy. As far as the changeability of that strategy or flexibility, we certainly have choice, but as John mentioned, we\u2019re really flexing the capital and the timing of the capital, especially around battery plants and overall manufacturing capacity. So, we\u2019re not changing the product strategy, but we are flexing, and that\u2019s our bet, is that we will flex the capacity. From a product planning standpoint, we\u2019ve made, I think, really good bets on the ICE and HEV side in case the EV market is not as fast as we thought. We have affordable Mavericks. We have a strong international business now with Ranger and Everest. Those markets won\u2019t go EV anytime soon. And the markets where we\u2019re in, like F-150, Super Duty Pro, they\u2019re not duty cycles that are going to go EV, and we have really fresh product. So, our bet is maybe different than others who just said, look, we\u2019re going to get rid of an ICE Explorer and go to an EV Explorer. That\u2019s not our strategy. John Murphy : It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Dan Levy with Barclays. Please go ahead. Dan Levy : Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. I appreciate, Jim, the commentary that you gave on warranty and just cost more broadly, but I wanted to ask the question maybe in a slightly different way. This is, obviously, as you pointed out, a lingering issue. I think you said at the CMD earlier this year, it\u2019s a $7 billion cost gap versus your competitors for Blue. What exactly is the line of sight or how confident are you that these issues can be turned around? Just because these have been issues for some years. And specifically, in the context of your pivoting to new architectures here where there\u2019s obviously going to be some uncertainty on your end, what gives you the confidence or the line of sight to actually turn around these cost headwinds? John Lawler : Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll start, Jim, and then hand it over to you. What I would say is that there\u2019s a real focus now in the company, and Jim mentioned it in his remarks, around excellence and delivering, right, execution. When you look at the real fundamental issues that we\u2019ve had across the industrial platform, it\u2019s the way we work together, our focus of the work, and the structure of the work, and there have been those that have thought this has been an issue for years and others that haven\u2019t. And I think we\u2019re finally starting \u2013 not finally, as a team, we are coalesced around those root cause issues. We have great new talent in the company, Liz Door, from a supply chain standpoint, her domain expertise is outstanding. Bryce Currie from a manufacturing standpoint, outstanding. And then in addition to having Doug, bringing Kumar back into the fold, who grew up in the system as a design and release engineer and understands the Ford system and understands the air states really well, having them all together now driving this foundational change is important. And as Jim said, it\u2019s the area under the iceberg, right? It\u2019s what\u2019s under the water, and it\u2019s the most important piece of it. And the progress isn\u2019t showing up as quickly as we would like in the part you see above the water, but the change is being driven below the water. And it\u2019s the same root cause issues that are driving the quality problems, as well as the cost structure issues. And it\u2019s the material cost at about 4 billion, and now we have warranties about 2 billion, and then you have manufacturing, etc., in there. And so, it\u2019s the talent. It\u2019s what we\u2019re attacking. It\u2019s the relentless focus on excellence, and it\u2019s the way we\u2019re working together as a team to go after these issues. And having the new team in place and having the new talent in place and watching what they\u2019re going after and how they\u2019re working together as an integrated team is what we need to get this done. Jim Farley : And I would just complement that in two ways. On quality, our real test for our commitment, talent, all things that John talked about came together in the launches of our most important products like Super Duty. And I am so confident in our tackling these systemic issues because of what happened on our recent launches. The team doubled down on testing. They did the extra work on supplier quality and readiness in the factory and really tested the vehicle for failure. And we did something that Ford maybe hasn\u2019t done in the past. We held the vehicle until it was right. And in the case of Super Duty, that was $1 billion-plus decision. And that was proof to me this team understands that quality is our top priority. That message was sent throughout the company. Everyone got the memo. On cost, on EV, I\u2019m encouraged because we\u2019re designing from scratch, and a lot of the talent we brought in approaches that cost is a pride point for them in designing it in. The real test for us as a leadership team beyond quality is going to be bringing our material cost and negotiated parts price cost down on our carryover ICE vehicles. That is going to be the test, and we believe we have more than $1 billion of ideas already in the hopper for this year, for 2024. And we got to deliver it on those ideas. They\u2019ll test our standards from rust protection and NHV. They\u2019re going to test our standards. They\u2019re going to test our parts release process. It\u2019s going to be \u2013 but it\u2019s us to execute. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. Just a follow-up quickly on pricing, which I think has continued to outperform beyond anyone\u2019s expectations. Maybe you can give a little bit of voiceover on what you\u2019re seeing on pricing, especially in light of all the questions out there on affordability and how long you think some of these pricing tailwinds can be sustained into next year. John Lawler : I think it\u2019s different for each of the business segments, right? We\u2019re continuing to see incredible downward pressure on pricing this year on the EVs, right? But Pro, really strong pricing power right now. As Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we\u2019ve got really good strength in the orders coming in for the model year. You know, we\u2019re a good ways through the model year, and the pricing is held. And then when you look at the fresh lineup we have on Blue, we\u2019re continuing to see the pricing hold for the most part. Now, are we starting to see that there\u2019s some pressure on pricing? Sure. And we said there would be, but it\u2019s been more resilient than we thought this year. That\u2019s for sure, especially through the third quarter. But affordability, we\u2019ve talked about this before. Affordability is an issue. Right now, it takes a consumer about 14% of their monthly disposable income for a vehicle. Pre COVID and pre the inflation that we\u2019ve seen, it was about 13%. So, we think it\u2019s going to revert back to that, and then we think it\u2019s going to happen over the next 12 to 18 months. And so, to do that, it would be about a net price reduction of $1,800. But we also believe that part of that\u2019s going to come through the OEMs in lower prices. But it\u2019s also going to come through dealer margins because dealers are still transacting at a much higher percent of MSRP than they have in the past. And so, it\u2019s going to be both of those. Now, we expected some of that to occur throughout the year. So far, it hasn\u2019t much. And so, I think you\u2019re going to start to see that come through as we move into next year. Operator : The next question is from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : Hi, everybody. I wanted to ask a couple things on EVs. I think that certainly \u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t think \u2013 you\u2019ve been saying that the deflation that you\u2019re seeing in EVs has been steeper than you assumed. But I \u2013 obviously, your original plan assumed some level of deflation through 2026. I think it was even price parity with ICE in some cases, and yet you assumed 8% margin in that time frame. Am I correct in those assumptions that your ultimate view was that you would get to price parity with ICE? And if that\u2019s the case, why \u2013 what do you need to do in order to push harder? Do you need to actually reduce prices even below ICE in order to achieve your plan? Or do you need to achieve even greater \u2013 a greater price premium? John Lawler : Yes, Rod, John. Exactly. If you look at our three-row SUV, the way we thought about that, our Gen 2 product was it\u2019s going to have the exterior of size of an Explorer and the interior space of an Expedition. And so, when we looked at that and setting the targets for the team in 2026, we said, well, you should \u2013 we should start out with a revenue assumption that it will be priced on an ICE \u2013as an ICE would be between those two to vehicles. And so, that\u2019s how we set up the affordable targets that we gave the team to design to. And a lot has changed, but the team is working diligently to try to deliver that. And we are continuing to see pricing pressure in the EV segment, but right now, there\u2019s still a premium to gas in many areas. So, I think what you\u2019re going to find is, over time, that premium is going to reduce as we move forward. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying \u2013 we have built into our planning assumptions for our second-generation vehicle and then as well for our third-generation vehicle, that you\u2019re going to see another step down on pricing so that these vehicles are affordable. And that\u2019s all setting up our cost structure that we\u2019re targeting and going after, which was the basis of setting our 8% margin. Rod Lache : Okay. So, that\u2019s still your expectation, that you would get to an 8% margin and you would have a cost structure that reflects price parity with ICE? John Lawler : Yes, that is the target that the team is going after. There\u2019s a lot that has changed, as you know, and the team is working through that. The key three elements Jim went over is most importantly, the size of the battery, the efficiencies of watts needed to move the vehicle, the vertical integration, the partnering on what we would say are commodity parts of the business, things that aren\u2019t differentiating for additional opportunity there, the scaling and using the capabilities of the vehicle as we build out the manufacturing facilities to be as lean as efficient as possible. And the team is pushing hard to get every save that we can through there to build out our Gen 2 vehicles that are profitable and deliver ultimately the 8% target that we\u2019ve set for them. Rod Lache : Okay. And just secondly, I\u2019m assuming that you still view vertical integration and batteries and LFP is critical to achieving your cost targets. Just given all of the issues around that, can you just \u2013 and some of the pauses or delays that you\u2019ve got on some of these plants, can you just give us an update on what the trajectory is to achieving those lower costs in batteries, and how is your plan changing? John Lawler : Yes. So, we\u2019re continuing to move forward with the vertical integration on the battery itself, working on cell design. We\u2019re working on the chemistries. As we said, we have no real change to what we\u2019ve put out forward before on BlueOval Park battery plant here in Michigan. But LFP is definitely going to be part of our future EVs, and that is a very important cost-reduction step in our path for the Gen 2 vehicles. So, it\u2019s a combination of all of that. It\u2019s a combination of the battery size and the efficiency of the vehicle to get the lowest watts possible to hit the ranges that we\u2019re looking to hit. It\u2019s the vertical integration across the vehicle, the vertical integration across the battery, and then as well as the chemistries. And all of that comes together to drive the cost reductions we need and the team is working toward is that part of the vehicle\u2019s target. Rod Lache : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our final question today comes from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much. So, I appreciate your candid assessment of the EV business and as well as all the actions that you detailed in terms of trying to reduce the investment and losses in the near term. At the same time, you rightly acknowledged that impacting change \u2013 affecting change on the first generation is not going to be the easiest. You know, more change would come in Gen 2, Gen 3. So, any way you can just frame for us how much improvement can we expect during this first generation? You\u2019re now running at something like a $5 billion annual loss on Model e. Not that long ago, a few months ago, you still had fairly near-term targets to bring that to EBIT positive. Obviously, a lot has changed. But then you\u2019re addressing these changes with your actions. So, where does it go from here? Does it get worse? Does it get better? Can something be done before Gen 2 and Gen 3 in terms of improving the losses? John Lawler : So, you\u2019re right, a manual step function change is going to be on the Gen 2s where we\u2019ll have more degrees of freedom to make the types of changes I just talked about. On the Gen 1s, we\u2019ve seen the price come down much quicker than we had expected, of course, and that\u2019s showing up in our results. We\u2019re continuing to work very diligently on additional cost and design reductions on the Gen 1 products, and the team is also working very diligently to minimize the impact of the lower prices in the near term, in the next couple of years before Gen 2 comes out. And so, it\u2019s going to be a battle between managing the top line as best we can, adjusting the supply of products relative to demand so that we can balance the pricing from that standpoint and then working like crazy to put whatever cost reductions we can on that Gen 1 vehicle through to the bottom line. So, I think it\u2019s going to be in the near term, it\u2019s going to continue to be just that. It\u2019s going to continue to be quarter to quarter. And the team working very diligently to hold as much revenue as we can and bring as much cost reduction through the product as we can. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you. And then a quick follow-up on Ford Pro. Obviously, extremely strong business and very solid quarter, but at the same time, there was a little bit of a pullback in both volume and mix and margin in the quarter. So, can you just go over the factors that drove this and the prospects in timing for normalizing back up? John Lawler : Yes. So, when you look at Pro the volume was down a bit. Part of that was we had some disruptions or hiccups from some suppliers which cost us to lose some F-150 commercial volume in the quarter. We had normal seasonality as well like on motorhomes and things like that. And then when you look at Ranger in Europe, that was down a bit still because of the ramp that we have going on on the new Ranger. And then there was a little bit of improvement with Super Duty. So, I think you saw some seasonality. You saw some fluctuations due to some supplier constraints and some missed volume in the quarter. And then, of course we continue to see the strength of the pricing on Super Duty, which is showing up with the higher revenues, yet the volumes were down a bit. So, overall, I think it\u2019s not that we\u2019re seeing a significant reduction in the demand for our Pro vehicles. We\u2019re not. The order bank is very robust. We have a lot of demand for the model year, and I think Europe Pro is going to continue to be performing at a high level as we move forward here. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, Gary, and welcome to Ford Motor Company's fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO and John Lawler, Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Marion Harris, CEO of Ford Credit; Kumar Gauhotra, COO of Ford and Marin Gjaja, COO of Model e. Today's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earning materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on page 25. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year over year. Company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis. Included on our earnings deck this quarter is a table of our global wholesales for 2023. With name, flight detail by segment and major geography, this is a roll forward of the detail we shared with you last March at our teach-in in our new segmentation. Lastly, I want to call out a few near-term IR engagements. Next week, February 15, Jim Farley and John Lawler will participate in a fireside-chat in New York with Rod Lash at the Wolf Global Auto, Auto Tech and Mobility Conference. February 22, Naveen Kumar, CFO of Ford Pro, will participate in a fireside chat in Miami with Dan Levy at the Barclays Industrial Conference. We do plan to run this call about 15 minutes longer, so that'll take us to 15 minutes after the hour. We want to leave ample time for your questions. Jim, I'll turn the call over to you. Jim Farley : Thank you, Lynn. And hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Last year turned out to be a fundamental year, a foundational year for our company. We launched some amazing [Technical Difficulty] Operator : Pardon me, this is the conference operator. We've seen that we've lost audio from the speakers location. Please stand by as we regain the signal. Pardon me, this is the conference operator. We have rejoined the audio with the main speaker location. Sir please continue. Jim Farley : Hi, everyone. I'm not sure where we got cut off but I want to just highlight how important last year was not only financially but a foundational year for our team. Our power choice and our powertrains really came through, and you can really see that on the F-Series, which I'll talk about in a second. Our global hybrid sales were up 20% last year and we expect them to be up 40% this year. We're now the number one and number two best-selling hybrid trucks in the U.S. Maverick is number one and we're the number three hybrid brand in the U.S. behind Toyota and Honda. But unlike them, our hybrids really sell best on trucks for our side. We launched some awesome tech. BlueCruise just passed 150 million miles of hand-free use, but more importantly, the growth is up 25% quarter-over-quarter and the gross margins for BlueCruise are at 70%-plus, the same for Ford Pro Intelligence. And boy, can Ford do work vehicles. The new Super Duty and Transit are off to great starts as is the new Ranger. We are really focused as a team on the segmentation. You can see the speed, the accountability for results and focus within the company. And our underlying business is getting better, as John will show. Despite the UAW strike, our auto profits were up year-over-year. We returned to investment grade, we have higher ROIC, and we have really solid conversion from profits to cash. We're returning capital to shareholders, we're declaring a regular and a special dividend, and we're getting much more disciplined on capital not just where we allocate, but more importantly, how much we spend and when. Our Integrated Services are really accelerating under Peter Stern. These are high-growth, high margin, as I said, and much less cyclical profits for us. We have one single leader, Kumar Galhotra on our industrial system and he is laser focused on quality and cost. And our international operations have made a remarkable turnaround after a lot of difficult restructuring. It's the second year we made profit. It's about a $3 billion turnaround compared to just three or four years ago. And what would surprise people is what a juggernaut Ranger has become. It's a global franchise and it's our second best-selling nameplate globally, just behind F-Series and ahead of Super Duty. Now John is going to go into last year's results. It was a solid year, but I want to be really clear, we are nowhere near our earnings potential for Ford Motor Company. And we are really positioned well this year for growth and profitability, for revenues as well. I'm going to cover four key areas. The first area is Ford Pro. It's nearly a $60 billion high-margin hardware, software and physical services business and most of that revenue is reoccurring. I believe Ford Pro is where the industry is going, an integrated business between all three of those factors. And we're seeing it first there because the customers use the vehicle more intensely and are more willing to pay for software. And we believe the attributes of Ford Pro are undervalued, but the performance will reveal that over time and look at the performance last year. Ford Pro doubled its EBIT to $7 billion despite a significant slowdown on Super Duty during the launch in the name of quality. And we're now on track for mid-teen EBIT margins at Pro. And you're going to see top and bottom line growth this year in Pro. We have the freshest product lineup in Ford's work history in two decades. Our order banks are exceeding our supply. And the reason why that order bank is so strong is fundamentally different economic factors than our retail business. What I mean by that is, look at North America. We're really dominant. We do really well on state and local government Pro sales. These are very profitable. And last year, state and local governments increased their spending by $75 billion or 16%, and a sizable portion of that is in infrastructure and people need Super Duties and Transits. Look at the build-out of telecom and 5G, directly correlates to our robust revenues. And the same is happening in the manufacturing sector in the U.S. with reshoring or onshoring manufacturing. Dealers are clamoring for more Pro allocation. They normally get only 50% to 75% of the volume they want. And in Europe, it's the ninth straight year of Ford being the best-selling CV brand, and we're just in the middle of launching the Super Duty of Europe, the Transit Custom and the new Ranger is now ramping up. Why do we think we're undervalued in Pro? Well, there's a couple of reasons. The first is our market leadership is a little bit opaque. We don't just lead in Pro, we dominate. We're 40% of the market share of Class 1 through 7 full-sized trucks and vans. In fact, many months, our second-place competitor isn't even half our size. Now commercial -- commanding that share means that we are dominant in vocations like service construction, utility and, as I said, government. But our biggest success is in TAMs where the market is biggest, small and medium-sized businesses and tradespeople. That's the backbone of the U.S. economy, and boy, does Ford have a reputation with those customers. Our second big moat is upfitters. Again, very difficult for investors to see but this is really significant. Every one of our landscapers, plumbers, electricians, they all upfit their Transits and Super Duties and Rangers specific to their vocation. So these upfitters being really important. We now have already developed a digital upfit integration system, and we share engineering specs with all those upfitters. We've been working with them for decades and they really trust Ford. They're even able to move their upfit equipment from old Fords to new Fords. The third big moat is a growing one. It's software and our physical repair business. Example of that is last year, we already have 0.5 million active software paid subscriptions at Pro. It's up 46% and the margins are over 50%. In two years, we expect software and services to drive 20% of the Pro EBIT. And that's supported by two things : getting to 60% mix on our connected vehicles and a threefold increase in our attach rates for those paid subscriptions that I mentioned, which are only at about 12% today. One of the biggest advantages we have in Pro that's hard for people to see is our physical repair network. It costs a lot of money to create, costs decades of time and there's a lot of expertise. In the U.S., we have 23,000 service bays that are busy seven days a week, 24 hours a day, and we're pressing on that advantage. Every day, we have new, very large service elite repair centers launching in the U.S. We haven't waited for brick-and-mortar. We now have 1,200 vans and Super Duties that are outfitted for remote service to our fleet customers. The Net Promoter Score is 10 points higher because they don't have to come on with the dealership. And this has effectively added 10% more capacity for our service. The bottom line is, we have these amazing vehicles. We have a leading market share position. We're now adding long-term durability of those products. We have a highly profitable alternative revenue streams in repair and software now. Ford Pro is really a magical breakthrough for our customers and our company and, I believe, the industry. Quality, we don't have to go into the negative effects about quality, but we've been addressing it for three years now and we're starting to see progress. Our vision is that we want to give customers, who buy our trucks and vans and our passion products, off-road, Bronco, all of it, the long-term durability from companies like Toyota and Honda, but in the segments we compete in. We already have world-class quality in many parts of our company, and now we're seeing green shoots in North America. Kumar is leading this and he's here for Q&A to answer any questions. But there are two aspects of quality I want to highlight. The first is launch quality. That Super Duty launch I mentioned, it was a line in the sand for this management team. We intensified all of our testing, our real-world problem-solving on the plant with our suppliers and engineers. We slowed down the launch and boy, did it cost us. $1 billion of EBIT we forego last year, but it was the right trade-off for our company and our customers. The result is the launch spike that every launch has we think on Super Duty is now similar to best-in-class in our industry, and we're seeing the benefits in the F-150 launch. That launch is underway right now and it's a really important one for our company. The second area of quality we're seeing progress on is initial quality. Now we measure that in three months in service. And that is highly correlated to long-term quality, and yes, warranty costs. And we saw last year a 10% increase. That is the largest improvement in the similar quality that we saw last time in 2016. It's the best in a long time and we are committing to a similar improvement this year. Quality now factors into 70% of the short-term incentives for our management at Ford. In the long-term, it's even more important, because we're measuring total shareholder return. We will share those KPIs on quality with you every quarter. Next thing I'd like to highlight is EVs. Now someone portrayed the change in the EV market as Darwinian. That could be a slow evolutionary change, but we think this has been a seismic change in the last six months of last year. That will rapidly sort out winners and losers in our industry. Now the catalyst for that seismic change is a combination of EV manufacturers cutting their price by 20% across all major geographies and a tremendous amount of capital flowing and a ton of new capacity into one single segment, two-row crossovers. Our overall EV strategy has never been more relevant as the seismic change happens, and we want to share with you our targets. Our next Gen 2 products will be profitable in the first 12 months of their launch. And that will mean that we'll get to mid to high single-digit EBIT profit margins over their life cycle, and that's going to deliver profits above Model e's cost of capital. And here are our big bets and adjustments. We're going to spend less capital on larger EVs. And as we've always said, we'll have a very small number of those. We're going to focus those large EVs on geographies and product segments where we have a dominant advantage like trucks and vans. And those products will have breakthrough efficiency compared to our Gen 1 products, and they're going to be packed with innovations that customers are going to be excited to pay for. We're also adjusting our capital switching more focused on to smaller EV products. Now this is important because we made a bet in silence two years ago. We developed a super-talented skunkworks team to create a low-cost EV platform. It was a small group, small team, some of the best EV engineers in the world, and it was separate from the Ford mothership. It was a startup. And they've developed a flexible platform that will not only deploy to several types of vehicles but will be a large installed base for software and services that we're now seeing at Pro. All of our EV teams are ruthlessly focused on cost and efficiency in our EV products because the ultimate competition is going to be the affordable Tesla and the Chinese OEMs. And that bet and all of the rightsizing of capital and even delays to some of our products, given the market realities, better balance growth, profits and returns for us. But one of the things we're taking advantage of and taking some timing delays is rationalizing the level and timing of our battery capacity to match demand and actually reassessing the vertical integration that we're relying on and betting on new chemistries and capacities. Our overall EV business will grow this year because we have the Explorer launching in Europe and really exciting, many of our commercial vehicles launched with electric this year as we refresh the lineup. We will also align production and inventory for customer demand. EV customers are also helping us in a very critical area of software quality. They really, really are teaching us a lot. And this is a critical place where I think we're ahead as a company. Why are we making these changes in our EV business and capital allocation? Well, because we learned as an early leader as we scale the EVs and hybrids simultaneously. The demand curve turns out to be for EV is very different than ICE. We've seen an explosive growth in EVs in 2021 and 2022, and we realize very quickly that our first three Gen 1 products, we didn't have enough capacity. With EV growth, but as well importantly, the COVID supply shocks and the chip crisis itself and Tesla's ability to make vehicles despite the chip crisis in \u201821 and \u201822 and the zero cost of capital gave us too optimistic of a demand signal at that time, and it drove a temporary spike in supply. As the COVID shock retreated, we learned that as you scale EVs to 5,000 to 7,000 units a month and you move into the early majority customer, they are not willing to pay a significant premium for EVs. This is a huge moment for us. What we've seen, because we offer everything, is pricing quickly converged to hybrids after any benefit from subsidies. Now Tesla found out this first but we were right behind that, and they were very exposed to early majority. But we learned very quickly, and I want to say that no one will be immune to this reality. The most obvious indicator of this reality is looking at total revenue, not units for EVs. Look at the U.S. market. EV total revenue was down in the second-half of last year versus Q2. If you look at unit volumes, they were up. That is a really important insight we learned in being a first mover. The same thing happened in China, same thing happened in Europe. Our data shows that EVs are a clear destination for many customers based on their unique duty cycle. It's going to take time more than we expected 18-months ago. But we are seeing big adoption variances by geography, and that's why the power of choice at Ford is so important and a big advantage for us. We're betting that choice and flexible manufacturing is going to get us successfully through this transition. Look at the best-selling vehicle in the United States, the F-150. We have a lightning, we have a hybrid and high volume and a nice choice. In Q4, in California, our mix was 50% hybrid and EV F-150 and 50% ICE. 1,000 miles away in Dallas, it was only 15% hybrid and EV, 85% ICE. You go around the world, you'll see same variations. Hybrids will play an increasingly important role in our industry's transition and will be here for the long run. Hybrid just hit specific customer use cases. On a Maverick pickup truck, our hybrid is focused on mileage and efficiency and they do the math very clearly, and they don't have to change their behaviors. On F-150 Hybrid, they get the same benefits even when they're toeing on fuel efficiency, but we throw in Pro Power on board on top of that to displace a very expensive generator cost. And margins on hybrids are closer to ICE, much higher than EV margins. The journey on EVs is inevitable in our eyes and we have a bright future of EVs. We're adjusting our capital and we're giving customers choice. Last thing I want to mention is talent. None of these breakthroughs in our company operationally or financially or in technical excellent innovation are going to happen without the right talent. And we've learned that the right talent is not sufficient. Over the last two years, it's been imperative that we go to a right performance management system. It's a fundamental change in the way we're running the company. We now truly differentiate and reward excellence at Ford, and that matches our operation and our business delivery. It's a massive culture change. Evolving to a compensation and benefit structure weighed more towards variable compensation that is tied to our delivery business results is fantastic. You can't bring in and retain the best talent without making this change. And now our long-term incentives and our short-term incentives are tied specifically to shareholder value creation. Over to you, John. John Lawler : Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. So 2023 was an important year as we continued to execute our Ford+ plan. Our strong global product line, which is clearly resonating with our customers, delivered revenue of $176 billion, which was up 11%, marking our second consecutive year of double-digit growth. We delivered $10.4 billion in adjusted EBIT, at the high end of our guidance, driven by continued strength in both Blue and Pro. Now to provide some perspective, compared to last year collectively, our core business units, Pro, Model e, and Blue grew, improved EBIT by $2 billion or 26%, and this is after fully absorbing roughly $1.7 billion impact of the UAW strike. Free cash flow was $6.8 billion, generating a free cash flow conversion rate of 65%. And this is above the top end of our target range and was driven by underlying strength in both Pro and Blue. Now both of these metrics provide a good litmus test for the effectiveness of our Ford+ strategy. Our balance sheet remains strong with nearly $29 billion in cash and more than $46 billion in liquidity. And this provides considerable flexibility to manage our business as the industry continues to transform. With the improving trajectory of our business and strong free cash flow, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share plus a supplemental dividend of $0.18 per share. This brings our payout ratio to 50% for the year, in line with our target to consistently return 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Now let's take a closer look at our performance. Revenue for the quarter was $46 billion, up 4% despite the impact of the strike, which cost us roughly 90,000 units of production. Adjusted EBIT came in at $1.1 billion with an EBIT margin of 2.3%, which again included the impact of the strike. Now let's look at our segments. Ford Pro delivered another strong quarter with revenue up 11%, EBIT of $1.8 billion was up 25% with a margin of 11.8%. Full year results clearly demonstrated the potential earnings power of this growth business. Revenue jumped 19% and EBIT more than doubled year-over-year to $7.2 billion, an improvement of $4 billion. And with a margin of 12.4%, we're just shy of our mid-teen target. The strengths Jim highlighted for Ford Pro are differentiated and drove strong results this year and have Pro poised for another strong year in 2024. Ford Model E drove a 14% increase in wholesales in the quarter, a 2% increase in revenue and EBIT loss of $1.6 billion. For the year, wholesales were up 20%, revenue was up 12% and EBIT was a loss of $4.7 billion. Both the quarter and year were impacted by challenging market dynamics and investments in next-generation vehicles, both of which Jim addressed in his remarks. In the quarter, Ford Blue revenue was flat despite the loss of roughly 60,000 units due to the strike. EBIT was $113 million with a margin of 3.1%. For the year, Ford Blue grew again with revenue up 8%. All of our regions are now profitable and contributing significantly to Blue's bottom line results. EBIT of $7.5 billion was up year-over-year with a margin of 7.3%. The improvement in EBIT reflects the underlying strength of our product portfolio, dampened by higher warranty and the UAW-related costs. Turning to Ford Credit. Ford Credit generated EBT of $280 million in the quarter and $1.3 billion for the year. As expected, full-year results were down year-over-year. Credit loss performance continues to normalize but remains below our historical average. Now before I turn to guidance, I wanted to touch briefly on capital allocation. One of the benefits of our segmentation, in addition to increased transparency and accountability, is that we are now allocating capital based on the growth opportunities in different risk and return profile of our segments. This allows us to assign specific risk-adjusted hurdle rates for each of our businesses, driving greater accountability to returns on the capital we invest. So here's how we're thinking about 2024 guidance. For the full year, we expect to earn between $10 billion to $12 billion in adjusted EBIT. The high end of the range would be a record for Ford. Adjusted free cash flow of $6 billion to $7 billion and capital expenditures of $8 billion to $9.5 billion, flat to moderately up year-over-year. So let me double click on capital expenditures. We expect EVs to be about 40% of the total, and this reflects products already in flight, including investments in EV powertrain supporting our next generation of products in our LFP battery plant here in Michigan. As we continue to adjust to market dynamics, we are scrutinizing every dollar and will continue to drive efficiencies, targeting to land at the lower end of our CapEx range. For example, in 2023, we already started to take action. We delayed our second JV battery plant. We reduced the size of our new LFP plant in Michigan, and we did not proceed with our JV battery plant in Turkey. And now we are further adjusting installed capacity to match demand, reassessing vertical integration in new battery chemistries, adjusting Gen 2 products and potentially their launch timing to ensure they meet our criteria for profitability, given the new market reality. Our 2024 outlook also assumes -- a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the U.S. and Europe, and our planning assumption for the U.S. is 16 million to 16.5 million units, Nonrecurrence of the UAW strike, full year of our all-new Super Duty driving both positive pricing and mix in Ford Pro, industry supply and demand normalizing. Now from a planning perspective, we are assuming lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the year. We expect this to be partially offset by top line growth from the launch of our new products. In addition, we're assuming a $2 billion benefit from cost reduction initiatives that offset higher labor and product refresh costs. Within the segments, we expect Ford Pro's strength will continue unabated. With continued strong demand for our leading products, we are targeting EBIT between $8 billion to $9 billion, driven by continued growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing. For Model E, we expect losses to widen to a range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in our next-generation vehicles. We expect our first-generation vehicles to improve their profits throughout the year. Ford Blue, EBIT to be about equal to last year at $7 billion to $7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation, including the impact of our all-new F-150. We also expect costs to be flat as we offset higher labor and product cost with efficiencies. And we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be up slightly year-over-year to about $1.5 billion. Now taking a step back, our performance last year reflects the positive momentum of our Ford+ plan. Capital discipline is driving the right global footprint, portfolio of products and consistent cash generation. We continue to see growth opportunities and remain focused on delivering improvements in both quality and cost. Now that wraps our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your mind. Thank you. Operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Jonas : Hi, everybody. Jim, I want to talk to you about Ford versus Ferrari, which is way, a great movie, by the way, and I think the good guys won. I remember a time when Fiat owned Ferrari, and I had a valuation of about $4 billion on it. Now Ferrari is worth $80 billion today, and the business was totally ignored by investors when it was part of Fiat. Now Ford's Ferrari, it's called Ford Pro? And I think we agree, people are ignoring the cash cow but I disagree with you, Jim. You said it's because of opaque kind of transparency or opaque kind of metrics. I don't agree. I think it's because almost all the profits are funding this EV science project. Am I being unfair, Jim, with that kind of assessment or what can your team do about this? I have a follow-up. Jim Farley : [Technical Difficulty] enthusiasm towards it. But relative to EVs, there's a lot we can do, and there's a lot we're doing. I think you're going to see a lot of seismic changes in the industry because of this pricing power reality that we've all faced. More OEM relationships, different shifting to a buy versus a build or vertical integration, shifting in capital and generally more focus on smaller vehicles. The EV customers are very robust. They really like the vehicles. They do not repurchase ICE or hybrid vehicles. They're very loyal and they love the vehicles, so it's on us to get the cost right. That is the issue with the transition. The good news is Ford has a high-volume hybrid business, and the timing of our second cycle product gives us a chance to make a lot of adjustments in capital, bringing it down, including and it allows us to execute them with a cost approach that's very different than our first generation. And I think all of our commitments to make money in the first 12-months of all of our launches, to have that kind of profitability in Model e, to return its cost of capital, I wouldn't be saying it if I didn't believe it. And it's also got a lot of other benefits, which I want the team to explain and that are really important to understand. Marin, maybe you want to go over those, or John? Marin Gjaja : Sure. Thanks, Jim. If we just think about what the Gen 1 vehicles can do for us, we're building the EV business and, at the same time, we need the compliance value. We mentioned before the value of the credits that generated allow us to sell these high-margin ICE vehicles. Each EV sold allows us to sell multiple high-margin vehicles. A Lightning can offset roughly... Jim Farley : Including Pro. Marin Gjaja : Including Pro. We're also building new customer-facing capabilities. We are satisfying demand that is out there where there's high levels of adoption. We've got new dealer standards, changing experience for the customer for shop and buy ownership and service so that we're learning what's required to serve these customers, both us and our dealers. We're developing a charging network through our dealers and together with Tesla. Now the adoption varies tremendously by geography. As Jim mentioned, across the West Coast, we're seeing 30% of the market in F-150 being in EVs. That volume is giving us a feedback loop for engineering. We're developing these electric powertrains. We've got better handle on thermal propagation, and the software and services that these customers demand much more intensely than a typical ICE customer, we're learning how to deliver those much better, much more efficiently and with higher quality. I would be remiss if we ignore the lifetime value of both the customer and the vehicle. We've got a 60% conquest rate on Gen 1 and the integrated services like BlueCruise that we can sell in these vehicles goes through the whole life of the vehicle. Jim Farley : Anything else, John? John Lawler : Yes. I mean, the only thing I would say is, Adam, one of the important things, just on top of that, is that the segmentation is really important here. And we know that the EV business needs to stand on its own, right? We're very clear about that. And it needs to generate a profit and a return on the capital we're investing. Now we're not there yet but that's what we're working towards. The compliance benefit that we get, that's important. We can sell up to a dozen ICE F-150s or other ICE profitable vehicles for every Lightning we sell. But that -- we don't do anything with wooden nickels. We don't do any credit into EV, into Model e or anything like that because eventually, this business has to stand on its own sooner rather than later. And that's a really important point. It's clean. Adam Jonas : Thanks, John. Jim Farley : By the way, Pro includes electric. And although electric is going slower for Pro customers, it's actually they do the math quicker than retail customers. And so actually, our January EV sales in Pro were higher than December, which would ever make sense. But we're seeing more and more Pro customers go electric if their duty cycle makes sense. So even for Pro, it's important for our success. Adam Jonas : I appreciate that, Jim. I just have just a brief follow-up on China. You guys come across as very sophisticated in terms of having sophisticated insight into China. You got Ambassador Huntsman on the Board, been there for years. You have a JV partner with Changan that's really kicking [Indiscernible] lately with EVs. So how can Ford work -- potentially work with Chinese partners to help Ford achieve its EV objectives in a more capital-efficient way? Thanks. Jim Farley : Thank you. Well, person right next to me, John was the head of Ford at China and knows the Changan leadership really well. John and I went to a trip last spring and it was really eye-opening for us. I mean, as two leaders who look to each other said, holy cow. I think, first of all, China as an export for our very profitable overseas markets is really important now. And actually, we shouldn't overlook the importance of JMC now. We have really profitable export business in China, ICE and EV. We're going to actually a very different strategy, I think our competitors in China with a very low capital approach to EVs. So we don't -- we see the kind of bloodbath reality now in China on EVs, and we're watching that really carefully. We don't think it's a good time to jump in with both feet in China with EVs, but we're allowing our partners' platforms to lead our electrification. And in doing that, we are learning a lot about their capability and the local IP there in China. And it's pretty breathtaking to see what we're learning. I think our approach of very low capital, profitable business is appropriate at this moment in time for this kind of EV explosion, but also bloodbath and profitability. And I think we're also building a global capability team for digital experience, battery and sensing tech and product concepting in China that we'll use globally. I think even though that's not a profit or loss thing, we see that as a real capability globally. So our strategy is quite different but I think it works for our company. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Jim. Operator : The next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good evening, guys. Just a first question here, Jim, on EVs. Obviously, it's a hot topic here. As you look at sort of the slowdown here, we're hearing from dealers, particularly I spent some time in NATO last week, that they're seeing EVs traded in and folks buying ICE and EV. So they're actually swapping out EVs and buying ICE and hybrids? And then you're seeing Hertz dumping 20,000 EVs and canceling or postponing orders. So both on the retail side and the commercial side, you're getting these stories. It's following up with data that folks are really not happy with the product sort of near-term? What do you think is happening, because the customers are not happy? I mean, it sounds like on the Pro side, some folks might be with the product that they have right now. And if you think about sort of your planning assumptions maybe near term, I don't -- just for argument's sake, say you have 100,000 less EVs? Do you think if you sell 100,000 less EVs at Ford, that you have the ICE and hybrids to backfill for that so you actually don't lose sales and you actually might be a little bit more profitable in the short-term? It's kind of a lot in that question, but just trying to understand what you're seeing in the market, why things are failing here both on the retail side and on the commercial side to some degree? And do you have the product to backfill if those volumes are lower? Jim Farley : You can imagine -- John, you can -- thank you for your question. You can imagine with our choice portfolio being big on scaled hybrids, ICE, of course, and EV, this is a very fundamental question for us because we have to plan our capacity years out. Here's what we found. Customers are doing the quick showroom math on hybrids. They can quickly evaluate the breakeven between ICE and a hybrid on the showroom floor. For an F-150, they can -- they know how much a Honda generator cost versus Pro Power on board, and they don't have to change their behavior. A lot of the operating cost efficiencies in EV for a mainstream customer require change like installing a charger at home, or they're uncertain. How much will I save on repair cost? How much will I save on electrons versus gasoline? It's harder to compare. And so we're just seeing the cost of ownership, which is interesting, because the success of EVs and Pro is a customer that does that math more brutally and they use the vehicle at a higher utilization. So they're looking at cost of ownership in a much clearer lens. And therefore, some of them are doing the math and going to EV. I think that math has always been there for HEV, but now more customers are interested in doing that. And we believe that customers are smart and some people would do these cycles for EVs. So going to do that math over time and it's worth investing because it's a really good business. But it's on us to get the cost right. So I just think we're seeing the math for an EV customer, mainstream EV customer is a little bit more opaque than what we see on hybrid. We're hearing -- Marin, do you want to say anything quickly about dealers? Marin Gjaja : Yes. I think what we're seeing with our dealers is they've been making margins comparable to their ICE vehicles in the last year. And in '21 and '22, we're actually doing better than their ICE vehicles when pricing was really strong. So we feel really good about making sure our dealers are making money on this and are making investments for the long-term. But I think that's something that we monitor closely. I think just building on Jim's point quickly, I would just say the big difference for consumers is they make that 1 choice every few years, whereas the Pro customer is changing their fleet, consistently buying lots of vehicles, and they test and they learn what the TCO difference is that total cost of operation. Jim Farley : And as far as the manufacturing capacity, we planned that 40% growth in HEVs years ago, so that is our capacity. We may have some pricing room above that. And we've seen actually HEV pricing become more robust as we hit these capacity limits. But 40% growth is a big increase for us. We think we got it about right. That means like on an F-150, America's best-selling vehicle, we think 25% of the sales or America's best-selling vehicles can be hybrid. And I think we're going to get close to some of the all-hybrid nameplates out there that people think of when they think of hybrids with F-150. So we have a lot of flexibility. I think we're in good shape. John Murphy : Jim, just one follow-up. I mean, you reported to a rumor to be doing a two-week tour to your dealers, around your different dealers. I'm just curious, I mean, some of them are happy, some of them are annoyed at the EV stuff. What is the general message going to be as you're going around to the all-important channel and trying to get the troops in line and everything moving in the right direction in the distribution channel? Jim Farley : A couple of key messages. First of all, I mentioned Ford Pro and what a profit juggernaut that is. We continue to need our dealers to invest in the brick-and-mortar in those remote service van and accelerate that because that is the upside. We want to get to -- if we want to get to 20% of the profit for Pro being attached services, it's going to have to come on the back of capacity in our dealers and vans. So invest in Pro. The second thing is we have manufacturing flexibility between ICE and EV and hybrid. So we want to make sure that they understand that we're in probably better shape than any other brand in this transition. The third message is we want them to understand our progress on quality, and we are going to press to be among the leaders in retailing. They should keep for our customer, remote pickup and service, doing more repairs for our retail customers remote, and that takes investment in their side. We really want to step on the gas on customer experience, both ownership and purchase. And I think that has to come from the top. Jim Farley has to say to all these dealers who are private investors, we need your partnership right now. That's why I'm going on the tour. John Murphy : Sounds good. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Rod Lache : Hi, everybody. Jim, you said that you're discovering that the adoption curve for EVs is a bit shallower, but we're still seeing $5 billion to $5.5 billion of losses in Model e, which implies that structural costs are probably higher in 2024 than 2023. So it sounds like you're committed because you see the ultimate benefit and maybe also a little bit because there isn't much choice. So ultimately, the question is, can you control and commit to when that business reaches breakeven, either through stronger demand or lower spending? Because from here, $5 billion improvement is pretty meaningful. Or do you have to do that because of the trajectory of ZEV and EPA and all the other things possibly exceeding where consumers are? Jim Farley : Well, we're not going to go to market with the vehicle unless we completely convinced ourselves that it's going to be profitable. And that takes some adjustments on timing actually. And we see opportunity in the short term to make some adjustments. But yes, I know it's a huge turnaround and it's a big number. John, maybe you want to go into the actual losses in Model e just to pick them apart a little bit. And then I think you'll see a little bit more about the opportunity we have at Gen 2. John Lawler : Yes, the biggest issue we have in our Gen 1 vehicles, of course, is that the revenue collapsed and they're not optimized from a cost standpoint. We put them through very quickly to get to market and you're seeing that flow through. But I think, Rod, part of what you were getting at is that we have no choice. And we will continue to work on improving the cost structure of the Gen 1 vehicles. And as Jim said, our Gen 2 vehicles we won't launch unless we can get to a profit and a return on that capital that we're investing there at the pricing environment that we now understand is reality. So yes, it is very much the mother of all optimization modeling and work around the balance between how many EVs we sell because we talked about the compliance benefit of that. For every Lightning, we can sell 12 ICE vehicles. We can sell a number of ICE vehicles with every Mach-E we sell, and so there's that balance. And then there's the balance of what we need to sell from the ICE standpoint and how we can improve with HEVs there, and that's a benefit, too. But there's also, and you'll see that in our K tomorrow, we are buying credits as they're available. So we have to optimize across all three of those frontiers and that's what we're working on right now. But we know that we have to have this electric vehicle business stand on its own and be profitable because we know that there are competitors out there. We talked about that the Chinese as well as Tesla that are profitable, and we have to cross that fulcrum and get there. And that's what our goal is. So it needs to be a benefit of profitable business, return on the capital plus the compliance benefit that we get from those. Jim Farley : And Rod, we have a lot of stakeholders at Ford so we're not going to go in a lot of details, but we have optionality even this year in capital spending. I mean, a lot of that guide is EVs. John, I don't know if you want to be specific but... John Lawler : It's about 40% last year and 40% of our CapEx this year and is EV. Jim Farley : And we're driving as a team to be on the low end of that range. John Lawler : Absolutely. Jim Farley : Because we are working hard on our EV spend. And I just want to make sure we don't want to leave this call with the fact that this is totally baked. We are working really hard to be on the low end of that range because we think it's appropriate to run the business. Rod Lache : Can you commit to breakeven at a certain point that you said before that the Gen 2 vehicles come out in 2026, is that kind of the time line for closing that $5 billion? And then just as a follow-up, I think you're saying that you've got line of sight on warranty coming down. Will we see the variable cost disadvantage that you've highlighted in warranty and material starting to come down this year? Jim Farley : We have the leader of our EV business here, Marin, so I think that question goes to you on timing and warranty. Marin Gjaja : Yes, I don't think we're prepared right now to commit to a specific timing on when we're going to be positive EBIT. We are going to expect to see improving gross margin quarter-over-quarter over the course of the year. John mentioned some of the levers we're starting to pull, and we will continue to adjust to the market realities. We've changed our production. We have increased C&I as need be to address our inventory issues. And we're going to keep working on our cost. We've taken 4,000 to 5,000 out of the BOM on Mustang Mach-E since it was launched and 2,000 to 3,000 out of Lightning and the team continues to work. But the market is turned and it's going to be a challenge. And I don't know that we can commit because we don't know exactly what's going to happen in the market. In terms of warranty costs, our Generation 1 vehicles, as we mentioned earlier, have been incredibly valuable for us to learn about a set of the issues around batteries and thermal obligation. And we will continue to work on that to lower our warranty costs dramatically for Generation 2, but we've got to deliver that in partnership with Kumar and the industrial platform. John Lawler : So Rod, I think the last part of your question was around, are we going to start to see costs turn? I would say that from a warranty standpoint, costs are probably going to be about flat this year. We're starting to see green shoots in the quality improvements. But as you know, the way that works, there's a lag. And Kumar can touch upon this a little bit more, but this year, we expect to see $2 billion of efficiencies flow through. And those efficiencies are in the material cost in the industrial system, pretty much offsetting the impact of the UAW. But also remember, 60% of our global portfolio this year will be refreshed. And coming with that will be incremental costs that we have for new features, compliance, et cetera. And so what we should see this year is the efficiencies of $2 billion offsetting the UAW labor contract plus the refresh costs of our 60% of our products being refreshed this year. Rod Lache : Got it. Okay, thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Dan Levy with Barclays. Please go ahead. Dan Levy : Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. I want to go back to Pro and your -- the guide that you have for this year is already in line with the mid-teen margin guide you provided at your CMD last spring. So really the question is, how sustainable is this earnings stream? And specifically, I think you've had something like $7 billion of price tailwind. Last year, I think $11 billion if you aggregate over a two-year stretch. I know this is partially driven by new product, but what is the sustainability of these very robust price tailwinds you experienced? Jim Farley : Well, first of all, I tried to explain the fundamental factors for our vehicle profitability in Pro that's driving that demand will be here for a while. It's basic infrastructure, government state, 5G, onshoring, manufacturing, manufacturing sector. We believe that, that's very durable. And by the way in Europe, we've been the top-selling brand there for nine years and we have very old products. So we haven't even seen the effect of Transit Custom and Ranger that's all coming our way. We feel that this is a pretty robust profitability because we've never had the 20% attach rates. We've never had 0.5 million units of software with 50% margins. We've never really focused on Pro aftersales like we are now. We're just getting started with this 20% of the profitability coming from attached services. And I think that totally changes the risk portfolio of our commercial business. And we -- this is a real opportunity for our company that we never had. I also believe that attach rates are the kind of things that we'll start to see on the retail side of our business. Blue's software is now 70% margin and it's high volume now. And we're just getting started with that optionality. So what it will be five years from now? I'm not sure the time frame of your question, hard to predict. But for the next couple of years, we're in a really good spot because the shovels are in the ground or about to get in the ground. The one other thing about Pro that we have to watch really carefully, which would be even more upside is a return to a robust construction housing market, which has been really slow in the last couple of years. If that starts to fire up, we're going to even have more capacity issues on Pro. Dan Levy : Great. And then as a follow-up, John, I want to go back to your comments that you just mentioned a second ago on the industrial costs. And specifically, I think at the CMD, talked about a $7 billion cost disadvantage versus your competitors in Blue. So how do we contextualize the cost improvements that you're adding now versus the $7 billion? I mean, is it safe to say that now this journey on sort of narrowing that gap is starting? Or is it still just still a lot more work to do? Just help us understand the path to narrowing that cost gap versus your competitors' inflow? John Lawler : Yes. What I would say is that it is now we're starting to gain the traction and that gap should start to narrow. And your -- that's part of the $2 billion. And so it's going to be across the industrial system, both in material and in labor. And I think Kumar can share some more details on how he's leading that and driving that. Kumar Galhotra : Yes. Thanks, John. Well, this year, we're starting very differently than '24 than '23, for example. A couple of fundamental different things. Last year, we had a lot of inflationary pressures and claims from our suppliers. Those have eased very substantially and are going to help us deliver the $2 billion that John talked about. The second thing is the supply chain is much more stable. That allows us to run our entire system much more smoothly and helps us remove a lot of waste. It also reduces a lot of our freight cost because we've been doing a lot of premium freight last couple of years so that will help as well. And in terms of material, we're attacking it in like 3 different ways. One is where our designs are not efficient, so I want to give you a bit of color on what those are, a couple of examples. In one of our vehicle lines, we were using certain aero shields for fuel economy and the fresh eyes Kaizen review internally and some benchmarking, the team came up with a different way of delivering the same aero and save $40 per vehicle. So that's equivalent to about $10 million per year. Another category is where we are providing certain features to our customers where they're not finding a lot of value. And connected vehicle data here is very important because it helps us see what we're providing, whether the customers are using it or not. So one example is an auto part feature that lets the customer parallel park automatically. Very, very few people are using it. So we can remove that feature. It's about $60 per vehicle, another $10 million per year. We're doing very extensive benchmarking for our manufacturing, both internally because we have lots of good ideas within our system and externally at a station-by-station level. So just recently, one of the teams completed analysis of about 50 stations and saved about $8 million. And I already mentioned the freight. So these are the kinds of very robust ideas we have in the hopper, along with less inflationary claims, along with a stable supply chain that's going to help us close that gap that John mentioned and save $2 billion this year. Dan Levy : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Emmanuel Rosner : Thanks so much. I was actually hoping to pick it up just where you left off on all that good color on the cost side. Are there any green shoots that you can sort of point us to, to give us increased conviction around some of these costs? Obviously, in 2023, cost was still a fairly major drag and that includes even in the fourth quarter. So like any in your reporting, any of these markets that we should be watching in terms of what will actually provide the tailwind, the $2 billion-plus in 2024? Kumar Galhotra : It's just fundamentally the things I talked about. We have a very robust hopper of ideas that we're very busy executing. Stability in supply chain, removing a lot of waste, and freight cost. So we spent a lot of money, all of us did, in premium freight. We're starting to see in fourth -- third quarter and fourth quarter a much more stable supply chain that allows us not to spend that premium and bring those costs down in 2024. John Lawler : Emmanuel, the other thing I would add to that is that when you look at '22 and '23, we were very much behind the curve of supply base, catching up to where they were and understanding what was driving their inefficiencies in claims. And we spent a lot of time in 2023 getting out in front of that. And I would say that we ended '23 with a great work that Liz has done to be at a very different place with our supply base. And now we're working together with them very proactively across industrial system to identify efficiencies, things that we can change to help them and, as Kumar said, design actions, et cetera, things like that, that will make them more efficient as well. So that's another bit of color to add to that. Emmanuel Rosner : Thanks so much. Just a quick follow-up on this. The -- should we -- will these things take time to play out? I guess I'm looking at your fourth quarter walk and mid-teen freight was still like a $1 billion headwind. So curious if you would need a number of quarters and then it would be a bit more back-end loaded? Or if we could sort of like turn on the switch and see some of these benefits in 2024? And then secondly, curious about your thoughts about the volume outlook for this year, especially for Ford Blue. I think some of the inventory days are sort of like towards the higher end of what you've historically been comfortable with it. So I'm wondering where you see volume growth for this year. John Lawler : Yes, so a lot in there. What I think you should see from a calendarization standpoint on the cost for 2024 is that you'll see, as Kumar said, a lot of these are the design actions we've been working to identify in 2023 that have built up this cadre of actions we call the hopper. And those will start coming through on the model year turnover. So more towards the middle of the year, you'll start to see a lot more traction there on those. Some of the manufacturing improvements, you'll see throughout the quarters, probably a little bit more of an even flow of those, I would say, right, Kumar? And so that's where we're at. When you look at our day\u2019s supply, when you look at our Blue day\u2019s supply, retail deal day\u2019s supply is in the low to mid-50s, so it's at about the limit of where we expect it to be. So leaning back that into volume, we expect the industry to be -- for the year, we expect it to be about 16 to 16.5 so maybe up 3% to 4% for us from a wholesale standpoint about that. From a planning perspective, that's where we're at. From a pricing perspective, we're planning to see about a 2% decline, negative pricing. And then when you step back and you look at that from an affordability standpoint, we think 2024 is the year where affordability is going to get back to pre-pandemic levels, where the monthly disposable income it takes to buy a vehicle should be back to about that 13% to 13.5%, which is what we saw before pandemic. So we're going to continue to see some top line pressure on Blue. We've got new product coming in Blue, which is going to give us some mix and some tailwind there. So that's going to be a positive for Blue. And then I think Jim covered off Pro. We're seeing incredible demand on Pro. And as you know, Emmanuel, those commercial orders come in two tranches. Half of them came in last year so they're all set. The other half are coming through now and we're continuing to see strength there. Marin Gjaja : And that portfolio is going to be freshened or new by the year-end. Emmanuel Rosner : Great. I appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. James Picariello : Hey, good evening, everyone. Just wondering if you could help dimension EV volumes for this year associated with the $5 billion-plus in Model e losses. And then with respect to Ford Pro's mid-teens margins this year, just curious on the impact tied to the fleet demand for EVs beyond companies, of course. Like do you foresee a step-up in Pro EV volumes for year, no Model e losses get more difficult. So just how are you thinking about the EV dynamic for Pro profitability as well? Jim Farley : On the retail side, I'll ask Marin to answer that. On Pro, absolutely, our EV sales will grow not only because we're seeing more interest because the cost of ownership is advantageous for some, but we're also expanding in Europe quite a bit our electric offering with our two Transit vans coming online. And so that will definitely -- and there are a lot of city closures and other kind of regulations in Europe that's driving adoption for electric vehicles, especially vans specifically. So yes, we'll have very robust growth in our EVs for Pro. Marin Gjaja : Yes. We expect growth in sales on the retail side as well. Remember, we had times where we were out of production last year on Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning. So we'll be overlapping those, we'll see growth. And then more importantly, we're launching Explorer in Europe in the second half of this year so that's going to be a new offering that will help us grow. So we expect to see substantial unit volume growth. James Picariello : And John, I know you touched on this already but are supplier cost reductions a core component of the $2 billion in savings for the year? Just wondering how commercial negotiations have progressed? And are there any areas that stand out in terms of opportunity? John Lawler : Yes. A lot of the $2 billion is, again, through the manufacturing system so it's the industrial efficiencies that we've been working on. And then from a design and material standpoint, it's mostly design reductions that are part of the $2 billion on a year-over-year basis. So it's those actions that we've been benchmarking and working on similar to the ideas that Kumar had described, pretty much design-related. Jim Farley : So design, labor and freight, yes primarily. James Picariello : Thanks. Operator : And the final question today comes from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : Thanks for taking my questions. I mean, obviously, a strong guide in aggregate. Digging into, though, the higher anticipated Model e losses of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, what is embedded within that from like a variable contribution margin perspective? How do you expect that to progress throughout '24? And then could we also check in a little bit longer term on how you're feeling about that Model e margin target of, I think it's 8% by the end of '26 annualized, right? Including after GM recently lowered their '25 EV margin target. And given that I think you rolled out that 8% before Tesla cut their prices and saw their overall margin actually like decline to be basically in line with yours. If you're still targeting 8% with the '24 guide out there now, it's really only '25 is the mystery. So it seems like quite a step-up then over the course of '25 to '26. I know you do expect a big boost from those second-generation EVs you discussed earlier but in comparison to the mixed fuel models. But is that just -- is that enough to get you to the 8% or are there other sources of improvement that need to layer in over '25 and '26? I don't know, vertical integration or what are those sources of savings? And how are you feeling about that target? John Lawler : Yes. So I think it's clear, given the dynamics in the marketplace and the way the top line come down significantly since we had put that out there that the 8% is not on in the 2026 time period. So I think that's clear. I don't think anybody believes that by '26, we can bridge from here to 8%. It's going to come down to launching our next generation of vehicles and improving the contribution margin, gross margin, as Marin has said, on the first generation as we go through the year. But Marin, do you want to add more color to that? Marin Gjaja : John, I think that's right. I think it's really the levers we're pulling this year to improve gross margin over time on Gen 1 and then really sticking to the capital discipline and the operating discipline around launching Gen 2 only when they can be profitable and deliver the kind of returns we want. And over time, that will build a stand-alone profitable EV business. Thanks. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session, and the conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

And June 11, John Lawler will participate in a fireside chat in New York with Emmanuel Rosner at Deutsche Bank's Auto Summit. Jim? Jim Farley : Thank you, Lynn. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us. The cornerstone of Ford+ is pretty straightforward, a more resilient business model, higher growth, higher margin, and more capital efficiency. And I would say, quarter one had a lot of great green shoots in that plan. It sets us up for a very strong 2024 and beyond. Before John goes through the quarter, I wanted to highlight four key strategic areas, how our growth drivers are changing, our progress in quality, the resilient Ford Pro business, and what we're learning on the electrification journey in quarter one. On growth, the portfolio changes we made and the restructuring we've done in our geographic footprint has really paid off for Ford. Several years ago, we normally would be reducing our volume and our mix and having good news on pricing. What's changed in the last year, and especially in Q1 you could see, is our top line and bottom line profitability are increasing, driven by improved volumes and mix. And we're actually seeing pricing headwinds. And that new portfolio and geographic footprint is really tremendous to see at Ford. There is no better example for this than the portfolio changes we've made in our truck and van business. Ford is the number one best-selling pickup manufacturer in the world. And our Ford Transit Cargo Van is the best-selling in the world. It's now our second best-selling nameplate at Ford. And our midsize Ranger, not our most affordable pickup, is a third best-selling vehicle at Ford. And together with the Everest makes up our profits outside of China, North America, and Europe. It's an incredible new franchise for Ford. These changes in our portfolio at all different sizes and price points in the truck and the van business has really played to Ford's strength. And it doesn't stop there. Our growth drivers are diversifying. We now have a vibrant software business and physical services business led by Ford Pro. You don't need to look very far beyond our mobile services. An example, Ford now has 3,500 or more remote service vehicles in our fleet globally. And last year, we did 2.4 million remote service experiences, both remote service and pickup and delivery. 40% of that was for Pro and 60% was for our retail business. Ford now has more than 700,000 paid subscribers for software. That's up 47% year-over-year. It's capital efficient, and the gross margins are more than 50%. Our quality is making real progress. Kumar and the team have really focused on key areas. Our '23 model year, three months in service, initial quality is 10% better than the previous model year. And we're seeing our current model year that we're selling for several months, another 10% improvement. That should put us in the middle of the pack. And many of our vehicles start to lead their segments in initial quality. But to bend the curve on warranty costs and customer recalls, we're really focusing on our launches. We're past the Super Duty launch now and well into the F-150 launch, and we made a lot of changes to improve and bend that curve. On the F-150 and others, we've delayed the OK2Buy three to six weeks. We've taken a lot of new testing regiments. Actually, we ended the quarter with 60,000 units in our plant stock, which hurt our first quarter but will benefit because we're shipping those now in our second quarter for all those quality processes. And what we're so far seeing is, we avoided about 12 recalls on F-150. And we're seeing the best performance on 3 MIS after a launch in a long time. And I'd like to be specific here. Normally, after a launch, we've seen about -- in the last five years about a 70% spike in our defects. The industry average is about 20%. And the Super Duty and Mustang launches were about that industry average 20% spike. And now, we're seeing with the F-150 even better performance at industry average. And boy, do we have a lot of launches in the second half to prove out this new launch process. What we're going to see long-term is fewer recalls and lower warranty costs because of this new process. I'm really proud of the team's progress on quality. And we have so much more to do. I'd like to talk quickly about Ford Pro. I mean, look at quarter one. We made $3 billion. That's how much we made the whole year in Pro two years ago. We're growing revenues, EBIT, EBIT margin, we're growing our volume. Our attach rates for high margin software and physical services are improving. And when you ask yourself, why is this different? Why would this business -- why would these profits be more resilient than our retail business? It comes down to three things. First is, the diversity of our customer base. About a third of our Pro customers are small business. Another third are large companies and about 20% more is governments, all different kinds. And the diversity of those customers and all three of them are driving a white-hot demand for our vehicles and services right now from infrastructure build out, roadworks, 5G, onshore manufacturing and re-fleeting for our key government fleets. One out of four of those fleets are all Ford, and boy do they trust our company. But more than anything, it's the breath and freshness of our new lineup at Pro that's driving our profitability. We have the freshest lineup we've had in 20 years in Pro. We have an all new Super Duty, an all-new Transit from top to bottom. And we have an all new Ranger and five plus plants around the world. These new products are really attractive to customers. And beyond that, we have the most diverse Class 1 to 7 lineup in North America, our key market. And that adjacency sales are important because customers buy different kinds of vehicles for us in the same fleet. But beyond that, in those fresh nameplates, we offer the best choice. We have cabin chassis and cutaway versions of our vans, different wheel bases and heights, the same on our pickup trucks. And we also have the most choice in terms of upfitters. We have 500 different upfitters across Western Europe and the US that prefer to work with Ford because of our experience with them. And it doesn't stop there. We've designed all of our commercial vehicles with a multi-energy platform. And that allows our customers to choose electric, partial electric, diesel, petrol, whatever choice on powertrain that best meets their cost of ownership. No one has this kind of lineup in our business globally. The third key area is the diversification and the completeness of our software and physical services experiences for our customers. Now, 13% of Ford Pro's profits in the last 12 years make up these attached services. And it's a big change for us. And what's really driving that is our advantage in physical service. We have the largest repair network you can find of any brand out there. And we're widening that gap. We've added 700 commercial service bays in the last year and more than 11 very large service lead centers with between 50 and 200 repair bays that are open 24/7 for our customers. None of our competitors offer this kind of extensive repair network. And it doesn't stop there. We have over 2,000 remote trucks and vans doing remote service for our Pro customers, no brand can match that either. And now we have over 560,000 active software subscriptions for our Pro customers, that's up 40%. And that Pro Intelligence business took many years to build. It requires advanced electric architecture. It's a really hard moat to copy. Long list short, Ford Pro is in for a great performance over the next several years. What did we learn on electric so far? Well, as you know, we're number two in our home market and electric sales for the last couple of years. And boy, we learned a lot. Since Capital Markets last year, we continue to adapt to and evolve our spending and our investment ramp for battery plants and assembly capacity for our EVs to match customers demand. And more importantly than all of that, match the price expectations. We're retiming our launches and our capital spending. In fact, this year we expected to spend about $10 billion as a company. We've now guided $8 billion to $9 billion. We'll probably be on the low end of that range. And we're being very consistent about our discipline on profitability. We expect every one of our EVs to make money in the first 12 months. And that is a very disciplined process. In fact, we delayed the launch of our three-row crossover, which is a great product, two years, not only to match the slower growth in EV, but more importantly, to take advantage of new battery chemistry and formats to substantially reduce the cost of the batteries for that vehicle. We'll do everything it takes to be profitable in the first 12 months of our vehicles. And what's our bet as a company? Well, it's pretty simple. We're going to bet on commercial work vehicles where we do really well, where we know the customers, where we can innovate for them like Pro Power Onboard with partial and fully electric vehicles. But increasingly, our bet will be on our new small, affordable platform developed by our team on the West Coast. Why is affordability so important? Well, when we look at the connected car data from our EV customers, we notice that people live in the suburbs, urban customers, they tend to drive shorter distances, and those more affordable vehicles, more approachable, and we believe that's where the adoption of EV will go the fastest. And we believe we can compete in segments of small cars and vehicles, more affordable vehicles in a unique way that's Ford. A good example was, we learned a lot when we -- in our more expensive vehicles, Mach-E, when in February we dropped the price 17%, our volume went up 141%. That's telling us that the more affordable we can make great product, the more attractive it is to these mainstream EV adopters. And the last thing I'd say is, we're learning about the importance of choice. Our growth in the first quarter in hybrids is a good example. We grew 36%, we think the full year would be 40%, we're now approaching 400,000 units of volume for our hybrid business. And we're now number three in hybrids in the US. It's a big advantage. We've been in the business for more than 20 years. And what's really exciting for us is for the first time, some of our contribution margins on hybrids are above or at similar contribution margins than our pure internal combustion engine margins. With that, I'll turn it over to John. John Lawler : Okay. Thanks, Jim. So our team around the globe is becoming more focused and adept at applying the Ford+ strategy, and we really did deliver a solid quarter. We are transforming Ford into a higher-growth, higher-margin, more capital-efficient and more resilient business. We're progressively shedding behaviors that have weighed down performance and valuation of legacy auto companies for most of the industry's history. Our strong global product lineup is differentiated, offering customers freedom of powertrain choice and drove first quarter revenue of $43 billion, up 3%. Our revenue has grown in each of the last three years and we expect 2024 to be no different. Wholesales were down 1%, more than explained by the late quarter launch timing of the new F-150. We delivered $2.8 billion in adjusted EBIT with a margin of 6.5%, reflecting continued strength in Ford Pro. Costs were up $1.2 billion, but if you double-click on this, you'll see that $1.1 billion of that was investments in growth by Ford Pro, including new products. Ford Blue and Ford Model e costs were roughly flat, and we're on track to deliver $2 billion of cost efficiencies for the full year. Adjusted free cash flow was a use of $500 million, more than explained by the vehicles in inventory, and this impact will reverse in the second quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $25 billion in cash and close to $43 billion in liquidity. And earlier this week, we also completed the renewal of our $18 billion corporate credit facilities, extending maturities by an additional year. Overall, our strong liquidity provides significant flexibility for us to invest in profitable growth. Consistent with our commitment to return 40% to 50% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders, today, we also declared a regular second quarter dividend of $0.15 per share payable June 3 to shareholders of record on May 8. I'll spend a few minutes summarizing the financial performance of each of our customer-focused segments. And there's evidence in every one of them of how Ford+ is making our business stronger. Ford Pro delivered a 36% increase in revenue on a 21% increase in wholesales. The segment has consistently delivered year-over-year revenue growth each quarter since we re-segmented our business. EBIT more than doubled to $3 billion with a margin of 16.7%, reflecting increased Super Duty and Transit production, richer Super Duty mix and higher net pricing. In addition, over the past 12 months, roughly 13% of Ford Pro's EBIT came from software and physical services, on the glide path to reaching 20% in a few years. And this important revenue stream generates sticky and recurring gross margins in the 40% to 50% range. And as you can see, given the breadth and depth of Ford Pro's competitive moats, investments in growth drive tremendous operating leverage. The segment's results this quarter demonstrate the consistency, predictability, and earnings power of this growth business. Ford Model e generated a loss of $1.3 billion as significant industry pricing pressure more than offset flat costs as wholesales declined 20%. In the quarter, we took action to bring down inventory levels. For example, after being at a price premium to competition in 2023, we lowered pricing on Mustang Mach-E in the US by 17%, bringing us in line with the two-row crossover segment. And as Jim mentioned, we did see elasticity with an improved mix of higher trends. In the US, retail sales jumped 77% versus the total EV segment, which was up roughly 2.6%. Our total EV market share grew by 3.4 points to 7.5%, and Mach-E was the second best-selling e-SUV, only behind Tesla's Model Y. The bottom line is that we're more competitive and doing well in the marketplace. We've reduced our stock levels significantly and the pace of sales has increased. In Ford Blue, revenue, wholesales, and EBIT were down, all impacted by the F-150 production ramp and vehicles and inventory. EBIT margin was 4.2%, and our international operations continue to be profitable across the board. Ford Blue's global product portfolio remains strong and our hybrid sales continued to grow, up 36% in the quarter as we get the benefit of hybrid products planned years ago. Our global mix of hybrid is currently at 7%, up 2 points year-over-year with more products on the way. Additionally, China exports increased 33%, including Lincoln Nautilus, and that's consistent with our strategy to better leverage that asset-light footprint. Ford Credit generated EBT of $326 million. In the quarter, financing margin improved and credit loss performance continued to normalize and remains below our historical average. Importantly, we continued to see a high-quality book based on strong FICO scores, which continue to exceed 750. And as expected, auction values have declined by roughly 10% as lease return rates continued to normalize. So we're beginning to unlock the huge potential for customers and all of our stakeholders with the Freedom of Choice made possible by Ford+. There's plenty of work ahead to fulfill that potential. However, the progress we've made so far is undeniable. We're delivering growth and profitability, sharpening capital efficiency and fortifying the resilience of our business. Accordingly, turning to our outlook, we continue to expect full year company adjusted EBIT of $10 billion to $12 billion and are tracking toward the high end of this range, and that would be a record for Ford. We're raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, supported by the underlying strength of the business and lower-than-planned CapEx. Our adjusted free cash flow guidance is consistent with our cash flow conversion target of 50% to 60%. We're tightening our CapEx range to $8 billion to $9 billion as the team adjusts to the dynamic EV landscape. We're scrutinizing every dollar and driving efficiencies that we believe could land us at the lower end of this revised CapEx range. Our outlook for 2024 assumes a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the US and Europe. Our planning assumption is for the US is 16 million to 16.5 million units. Full year of customer demand for all-new Super Duty contributing to better market factors for Ford Pro. Industry supply demand normalizing. From a planning perspective, we're assuming lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the year. We expect this to be partially offset by top line growth from the launch of our new products. There's no change to our segment outlook, which anticipates continued strength in Ford Pro, leading to EBIT of $8 billion to $9 billion, and that's driven by the continued growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing. As expected, a loss in the range of [$5 billion to $5 billion] (ph) for Model e, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new vehicles, and for Ford Blue, EBIT of $7 billion to $7.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and also cost efficiencies offsetting higher labor and product costs. And we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be about $1.5 billion, up slightly year-over-year. Our performance this quarter continues to demonstrate the positive momentum of Ford+. Capital discipline is driving the right global footprint, portfolio of products and consistent cash generation. We continue to see growth opportunities and remain focused on delivering improvements in both quality and cost. So that wraps up our prepared remarks, and we'll use the balance of the time to address what's on your mind. So thank you, and operator, please open up the line for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today is from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Jonas : Hey, everybody. I got one question for John and one for Jim. John, you were just on Bloomberg saying EVs are needed to meet compliance regulations. Now it's my understanding that Ford does not disclose penalties or ZEV credit purchases for Ford on Clean Air Regulation. Can you confirm that? That's not disclosed, right? John Lawler : So let me clarify a few things, Adam, on that, is that it's not an option for us not to be compliant. If you don't comply with your ZEV or your greenhouse gas emissions requirements, you can't pay fines. What happens is you can't sell, and that's consistent across the industry. So it\u2019s -- that's for all OEMs. All OEMs are under those rules. And so there's really three levers that we have. We can sell EVs and hybrids, we can sell fewer ICE, or we can contract to buy credits from another OEM. And when we do contract to buy credits, we will disclose that as we did in our 10-K at the end of the year. And so those are the three levers. And we, I would say, monthly, if not weekly, are working to optimize across those three levers to drive the highest profitability and the highest cash flow for the company. So to continue to sell the ICE vehicles, we are going to need to sell EVs, and we're going to optimize across the profitability. Now the most important thing, as Jim said, is we need to get the EV business to stand on its own, to be profitable, and return on the capital we've invested, and then all the levers will be accretive to Ford and we'll be able to make it really positive. So that's what we're focused on, and that's what I intended to communicate earlier today. Adam Jonas : Okay. But you did -- so you do disclose? You did disclose the ZEV? What was it? John Lawler : Yeah, we disclosed last year in the 10-K that we had purchase commitments of $700 million. Adam Jonas : And will that increase this year? John Lawler : In the first quarter, there wasn't anything material. And as we go through the year, if it's the right lever to pull, as I said as we're optimizing, we will report it. Adam Jonas : I appreciate that, John. Just my follow-up for Jim. Ford Pro is kicking butt, okay. And at 10 times EBIT, that business can be worth like double Ford's entire market cap. So the market is kind of implying that the rest of the business will be valued at negative many, many tens of billions. Seeing another way, your stock, I mean, this business is incredible. People would die to have this business. And I think folks are aware, it's not a secret anymore, Jim, but people are aware of how good this business is. Yet your stock ranks 491 out of 500 companies in the S&P 500 on PE multiple. Now, Jim, I know you don't like it and I know you don't agree with it, but can you explain why does the market value -- your company is one of the lowest multiple companies in the world in any industry, why? Try to rationalize that for me because it seems important that you, as a leader of this organization, understand that, so you can address that problem. Thanks. Jim Farley : Thank you, Adam. And first of all, thanks for your report on Pro. I appreciate you taking the time to understand the business. Look, I mean, we -- as John mentioned, we have to make tremendous progress on Model e. It's a huge drag not just on Ford but on our whole industry, even for pure-play EV players. So -- and we're very clear-eyed about that. We're very committed to transparency. A lot of OEMs will handle EVs very different. We won't. It's like if we had an unprofitable regional business and we rolled it up and it wouldn't be transparent to investors, we would never do that. We're not going to do that with EVs, and we're not going to subsidize our Pro and Blue business by not being transparent about e. It's how we run the business. I think investors should understand for me as a leader is that we're going to build a sustainably profitable EV business with terminal value. And we -- and it needs to return the cost of capital on its own and not be subsidized as I mentioned. And the real turning point for us not only is our flat cost in Model e this year, but most importantly, it will be the profitability in our next cycle of products. And I'm proud of the work that our team has done to make the adjustments in our capital spending and to make sure that all of our next EVs are profitable. And the evidence will be there. And I think that is the main drag on the company right now as it will be for the whole industry. Blue is in really good shape. I wonder out loud, Adam, if everyone really understands the resilience of the Pro business over time. We're very profitable now, but we believe that this business will be profitable and durable for many years to come. And I'm not sure the full market understands that personally. I know you've gone through the business, understanding the demand, and I encourage everyone to understand and ask us more questions about Pro. Thanks. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Jim. Operator : The next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good afternoon, guys. The Freedom of Choice is a great marketing tool to go out to market with, and I think it's reasonably -- or should be very effective. But, Jim, as you think about this, as the market is shifting towards hybrids at least in the near term, I'm just curious what kind of capacity you have to ramp up significantly in hybrids if the demand really is there. And if you think about sort of the competitive threat really coming from Toyota with a lot of capacity on this side, is there risk that there's market share losses to them over time? Or do you have the ability to really step up here? I think you mentioned something about 400,000 hybrids on an LTM basis. But can you do a whole lot more and really sort of garner your fair share of the market? Jim Farley : Hi, John. We made a lot of capacity decisions several years ago on hybrid, and I'm very thankful we did. For example, we just radically increased the capacity for F-150 that we're launching now up to 25%. And it takes, as you said, it takes a long time for suppliers to ramp to that capacity. It's not assembly capacity that\u2019s a constraint. So that 400,000 is almost double what we did a couple of years ago. That was all very intentional. And we made the decision a couple of years ago to actually make hybrid more pervasive in our lineup, and we're actually now going to -- we've now committed publicly we're going to offer hybrid on all of our vehicles across our lineup. And of course, the capacity has to be there. But if you look at the pricing premium today, which is maybe the most important thing to look for because now that contribution margin for hybrid is covering the cost of the hybrid incremental material cost, that's really a meaningful development. And I think we're in good shape. Of course, our hybrid business is different than the others. We're number three in the US. Number one and number two is of course Toyota and Honda. But our hybrid capacity is in trucks. That's where most of our hybrid sales are in North America. And we don't see a lot of competition so far for that business. We'll see over time. So I feel really good about the decisions we made several years ago about our capacity expansion. Will it be more than 40% growth? It could be. And I think we have flexibility. Now we have really meaningful scale for our suppliers. A lot of our competitors will be starting from scratch. John Murphy : And I have one follow-up on Pro. It seems like there's a lot of pent-up demand on the fleet side, both on commercial and government. I'm just wondering if you can comment though on that on sort of a unit basis as well as potentially a service basis and just really kind of talk about what kind of benefit that may sort of still garner towards for Pro, which is, as you said, shooting the lights out or we should say that. It seems like there's a lot of opportunity here still just from a market release of pent-up demand, and that might be even more structural over time. Jim Farley : It's true. The demand on Pro is fundamentally different than retail. There's no doubt about it. Our retail customers are not re-fleeting. They're not doing roadworks and 5G infrastructure build-out. I mean, these are all fundamental drivers. The ambulance market in the US, the average ambulance is 15 years old. I mean, they've been waiting for Transits for a long time. We're now increasing our capacity, which is great. But I mean, we're oversubscribed on the new Super Duty 2 :1. So I wish I could say we got that right. We didn't, but we are expanding capacity. I think -- and we have this freshest lineup that we've never had. So we have this kind of double opportunity. Our lineup is fresh. We have the most choice. At the same time, our customers are in kind of white-hot demand that we saw in retail two years ago during the supply shock. And we're doing everything we can to increase our capacity for our customers. It's very frustrating for them. John Murphy : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I'd love to get some more of your thoughts on capital allocation, including after in the release, you repeat the intention to return 40% to 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. I guess with CapEx coming further down and FCF up, there's more to return. But at the same time, targeting to return only up to half of what you generate obviously implies you want to continue to grow cash on hand despite the current $28 billion being well more than the over $20 billion that you've historically targeted. And of course, you've got lots of available liquidity beyond that, close to a record, I think. So just curious what might be driving the conservatism here, whether it relates to more macro or industry uncertainty or wanting to preserve some other optionality or for some contingency I'm not thinking of. I think in the past when I\u2019ve asked this question, you'd sort of point to the industry transition towards EVs. But seems like the last couple of quarters now, your focus is more on improving the EV business by trying to spend less, not needing to spend more, all right? So just wanted to check in how you're feeling about capital allocation, what you're seeing that causes you to want to be conservative now? And then what could cause you to potentially want to become more aggressive in the future? John Lawler : Yeah. So, thank you. So we have our stated policy, as you said, 40% to 50% of free cash flow. Our balance sheet is strong. Our cash position, we ended the year strong. We're at $25 billion this quarter when we talked about the fact that our guidance for this year went up. So when we look at it, we believe that right now in the transition point for the industry, we would rather invest in accretive growth opportunities. And we've always said that if those opportunities don't come to fruition, then we'll need to look at other allocation decisions that we would need to make, but we're not there yet. So we're continuing to talk about this as a team consistently. But we think at this point, the position we're at, we're comfortable with, given where we're at in the transition. We'll pay out the 40%, 50% of free cash flow. The last couple of years, it's been at the high end of that range. And eventually, as we continue to execute on our Ford+ plan, if those accretive opportunities to allocate capital for additional accretive growth aren't there, then we'll look at other ways of returning that cash to our shareholders. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Bruno Dossena with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Bruno Dossena : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask in Model e. And I understand that reaching breakeven depends on the timing of the launch of the next-gen vehicles. But in the intermediate term, can you tell us how you're thinking about the trajectory of losses in e and specifically the potential to work down the structural costs associated with this business? John Lawler : Yes. So we are -- I don't know, it's a cliche, I guess, laser-focused on the -- all the costs around Model e. And for the year, when you look at -- well, let's just take it back up a second. The last couple of years, when you look at Model e, we've actually reduced the cost of our vehicles significantly. On Mach-E, we've taken over $5,000 of cost out, but the revenue keeps dropping faster than we're able to take out the cost. And we're being very thoughtful about what we're putting in as far as structural costs, et cetera. And so we're going to continue to work on driving every dollar of cost out of the business in the near term. And if the pricing stabilizes and we don't see these significant reductions continuing across the industry, then I think that you could probably start to see some of those cost reductions flow to the bottom line. But so far, the last 12 to 18 months, it's just been a continuous march down on the top line, which is offsetting any of the savings we've had from a cost standpoint. So it's in our control. We have to take cost out. We know that. That's what we're marching towards. And we're understanding the dynamics and the competitiveness of the market equation as we set up the cost structure for our second-gen vehicles. And as Jim said, we pushed out the three-row SUV because we need more cost to come out of that for that to be at the margin levels we expect. Bruno Dossena : Okay. On a similar vein to the comments you made around cost and pricing for the Mach-E, if we look at your combustion, Blue and Pro, we see the costs are up $1.2 billion year-over-year, presumably from material content on some new launches, warranty, maybe offset by some savings. And we also see that pricing in these businesses is up about $1 billion. But can you give us some insight into if or when you'll see some improvement in variable costs relative to pricing and Ford beginning to close the variable cost gap compared to peers? John Lawler : Yeah. So you look at that, most of the cost this quarter was up in Ford Pro and is all related to the material costs for our new product launches, both the Super Duty and the Transit that we launched in Europe as well as manufacturing costs for the increased volumes that we're bringing across, as Jim mentioned. So that's what drove most of the cost increase in the quarter. We're on track to deliver the $2 billion of cost reductions we talked about at the beginning of the year of raw manufacturing costs, material costs as well as freight and overhead. And so you'll start to see that really gain traction as we move through the second half of the year. And that's when you'll start to see it on our quarterly results. Operator : The next question is from Itay Michaeli with Citi. Please go ahead. Itay Michaeli : Great. Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Just two questions for me. First, on back to Pro. With a $3 billion outcome in Q1, can you maybe talk about the puts and takes, if I think about the rest of the year? And maybe should we think about the full year at the high end of the range? And then going back to Model e, the press release did allude to EV costs improving going forward but an offset from top line pressure. I was hoping you could help to mention what you're assuming for EV prices the rest of the year. And as volume kind of responds to these price cuts, is there a level where Model e can still become contribution margin positive over the next 12-plus months? John Lawler : So let me unpack that. So for the year, we're not projecting or sharing where we expect the cost to come down. If you look at what recently happened in the quarter when it comes to pricing on Model e, we had entered the year assuming that prices would come down about 20%. They came down much more than that. We had to take our prices down [in the] (ph) 17% to remain competitive, and mass competition as we went through the quarter. So we've seen prices coming down quite dramatically, and that's why we haven't been able to keep up from a cost reduction standpoint. Look, we're targeting to take out as much cost this year as we can on Model e and all in the spirit of driving towards that contribution margin positive so we can have some leverage as we move volumes through the chain. So that definitely is our intention as we continue to work on Model e in the near term. Jim Farley : On Pro, obviously, Q1, Pro is really structured not necessarily on traditional demand like retail. It's actually deliveries. So our delivery volume in Q1, it's kind of -- it's a cyclical business globally and we have a lot of strong delivery in the first quarter just because of the contractual agreements with our customers, including fleetail. And when you look at the rest of the year, we have shutdowns. There are a lot of other -- we have launches. There are a lot of reasons why we feel really comfortable even with the strong result in the first quarter, that our guidance is still accurate for Ford Pro, given all the puts and takes. But we'll revisit in the second quarter. We'll see how pricing lands. We're going to be doing quite a bit of fleetail business this quarter as well as looking at locking in pricing for some of our large corporate fleets later in the year. So we're going to learn a lot more this quarter on whether there's tailwinds or headwinds on Pro. Itay Michaeli : Terrific. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Joseph Spak with UBS. Please go ahead. Joseph Spak : Thanks. Jim, first to start, I appreciate all the commentary you talked about on the F-150 launches and as well as Super Duty and Mustang and some of the improvement there. As you mentioned, you've got some other big launches coming up later this year, I think Explorer and a number of others. So was the lesson learned that you will go more cautious and careful? And is that -- should we expect a slower ramp-up than we've seen historically for some of these new launches later in the year? Jim Farley : I would say we're seeing real benefits to our customers and the company, I believe, long term in taking this new approach to launches. It also requires our industrial system under Kumar to work differently, to solve problems, to do different kinds of testing and that goes into kind of our longer-term lessons learned. And we're now really spending a lot of time on long-term durability, which is an area where Ford has standards but maybe didn't look to lead the industry, which we now look to. And so we're not going to change our approach to these launches. We think this new more measured approach with more physical testing, a lot more time for problem solving for our team is the right approach for the company in the midterm and long term. We do have some very significant launches coming up. We have Explorer and Aviator as you mentioned, which are high volume in both North America. And in China, we have a new wave, we call Wave 2 for the one-ton Transit in Europe, which is super profitable. And we're going to be building and launching the higher-end derivatives of that. We have the Bronco in China. I mean, I can go on and on. We have a freshened Maverick and Bronco Sport coming and even more models than that. So given all that complexity, it's actually even more important for us to take our time. And it may, like quarter one, it may mean that in some quarter ends, we may have some company stock and [plants] (ph) to make sure that we do the right thing on quality. So our earnings may be a little bit lumpy. We'll see how that works out based on this new approach. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just back to the hybrid conversation because as you pointed out, your hybrid portfolio is much different than Toyota or Honda. It's pretty limited. I think you only have like three hybrids right now. But how should we think about scaling that to the rest of the portfolio, as you mentioned? Is it really like taking existing power plants you have and trying to sort of fit it -- make it fit on more models? Or are there real new investments that need to be made for hybrids? Jim Farley : It's a good question. So I would say mostly, it's taking our current internal combustion engines and adding new hybrid components and doing the engineering to fit that. Look at the T6 platform. We had the Ranger. We had the Everest, we have the Bronco. That's an obvious candidate. We have our full-size SUVs, candidate. We have the Explorer platform. And I think we're lucky. We have the right engines. Some of them may have to go to an [action] (ph) cycle engine from a normal combustion cycle. We have the components in our system from the hybrid, the torque splitting devices that -- we do have to up the investment in some capacities like our hybrid transmissions, but we've made the decision to do that already and that's in our spending plan this year. I think we're in really good shape. It doesn't require wholesale inventing new powertrains. But it does involve some engineering and investment in capacity. I would say kind of modest investments, mostly in the capacity side and some engineering. Joseph Spak : Okay. Thank you for that. Operator : The next question is from Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Colin Langan : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. It sounds like you're pretty optimistic about pickup demand, but I think there's media reports that some of the data showing pricing was a bit weak in Q1, inventories look pretty high. So are you seeing any risks in the market? And where do you see pricing for some of these models coming for the rest of the year, I guess, now that you got maybe some of the 2023s out? And then where should inventory really end? John Lawler : Yeah. So what you saw in pickups for us as we came out of the end of last year into the first quarter of this year here in the US is we built up stock as we knew we were coming into the launch. So we built stocks of '23 models. And then we were selling those down in the first quarter throughout the majority of the quarter. And that's why you saw, to stay competitive with our competitors that had '24 year model pickup trucks, we saw some top line coming down. So we had higher incentives to sell the '23 model year longer through the quarter. You see now that our '24 F-150s are at dealers and selling. They're turning in about seven days. You'll see, as you look at the data, that our average transaction prices are going up and our incentive spend is coming down because of the '24 year mix. So that's a big part of what moved it for us on pickup trucks. And it was -- because we're such a big player, it was moving in [Technical Difficulty] Jim Farley : I just want to emphasize, I don't think there's a brand out there that has a Maverick. That's pretty much alone in the segment, and we still are in a supply shock for Maverick. It's one of our fastest-growing vehicles. We have an all-new F-150 with a hybrid option, as John said, turning really fast. We have a Super Duty on the Pro side that's oversubscribed 2 :1, and we have a brand-new Ranger. So we're a bit of a unicorn in the sense that yes, we're big, and there is some risk. But I would say the risk is for people who have aged product. And I think Ford is in a particularly advantaged situation. Colin Langan : And what about inventory levels? I think some of the data is showing in the high 90s ending up, March kind of coming down to... John Lawler : Yes, that's come down considerably, and if you look at us on an overall basis, our dealer day supply is mid-50s. Yeah. We're completely out of stock on Rangers. Maverick is like 30-day supply or something like that. F-150 came down because we had quite a few '23s. But now with the launch and the quality effort, I think the stocks are really in good shape. And Super Duty, we have very few in stock for retail. Yeah. So you've got to look at the dealer day supply, and that's in a good place. Colin Langan : And just as a follow-up, maybe color on industry pricing. What is sort of embedded in your guidance at this point? And how is pricing holding up, I guess, sequentially because I think some of the comps are a little tough with launches year-over-year? John Lawler : Yeah. First quarter pricing held up pretty well, Q4 into Q1. From a planning perspective, we assume that the industry, we expect to see pricing pressure of about 2% negative pricing across the industry. And it really comes back to affordability. Many folks across the industry have been talking about pricing coming down, though what -- and it hasn't. And again, we saw in the first quarter that it remained pretty robust. But we keep looking at it from an affordability standpoint, from the consumer perspective. And when you look at where consumers were pre-COVID, then we had the supply shocks and we had a very imbalance between supply and demand. But now as that's normalized, we would expect that affordability should go back to where it was pre COVID, and that's about 13% to 14% of monthly disposable income. And you also have to factor in right now with interest rates, that payment prices have gone up, insurance rates have gone up as well as maintenance rates. And so when you take all that together, we think about affordability, we say, okay, if you're going to be back towards that range of affordability for the consumer, then prices are going to have to come off a couple of points or so across the industry. And so that's how we think about it and that's what we have planned. And we'll see where that runs with Q2 and then as we go through the second half of this year. Colin Langan : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : The next question is from Tom Narayan with RBC. Please go ahead. Tom Narayan : Thanks for taking the question. Jim, we heard from your guys' commentary that EV prices those drops stabilized, then the losses would lessen. But as we've heard from some of the earnings yesterday, Tesla, GM, it seems like the opposite is happening. It seems like OEMs are trying to make cheaper EVs and that pricing is really only going to go lower. I guess, how confident are you that you could reduce EV losses in this environment if EV prices just keep on going down? John Lawler : So when you look at it, it's clear that when the EV craze started, right, it was -- it looked like demand was going to be well long supply. But that was with the early adopters and they were willing to pay a higher price. What we're finding with being in the marketplace is that EV prices are normalizing, and our early majority customers are not willing to pay a premium. And that's what we're seeing. And so we think that prices for EVs are going to normalize around where gas is and the consumers are going to weigh the value proposition of that propulsion choice, either for their duty cycle, what works for them, either it's going to be an EV or a traditional ICE engine or a diesel or a hybrid. And pricing is going to have to be relatively consistent across all choices of propulsion, and a customer will make a choice based on the value of that. And that's how we're building the business model for electric vehicles. I don't think that you're going to find that you're going to have electric vehicles well below gas prices unless there's so much capacity pushing against the demand curve, and it's an imbalance on that end of it. But eventually, rational players will have to come to the marketplace. Jim Farley : We launched our first small SUV this year in Europe in Cologne, our Explorer to two-row crossover. It's a relatively small vehicle certainly in the U.S. And you can expect, as I mentioned several times, that our new affordable platform will be used for most of our volume in their next cycle of product. What's really exciting for us is that we see an opening in the market. We see a lot of brands having to launch compliance vehicles that lose money, and they probably don't want to sell a lot of volume but they have to. We believe that we can be profitable at $25,000 to $30,000 so it's a huge opportunity for Ford. And what we're learning with BlueCruise and our Protiviti software on Pro is that all those vehicles will be great platforms for software and services. And so we're really excited about that new more affordable vehicle lineup, starting with Explorer in Europe this year. Tom Narayan : Thanks. And maybe as a follow-up, maybe this is something that could help here is battery raw mat costs, we have lithium down like 80% since the peak in 2022. Could you just remind us of how your contracts work? I think there's -- we've heard from some other OEMs that there's still some benefits to come, actually getting better, given how contracts work and you could actually see benefits on battery raw mats later in the year. John Lawler : Yeah, we're seeing the same thing. We're no different. Jim Farley : I would say that the biggest leverage on the battery cost is still going to be taking nickel out of them and those kind of things. It's great to see the easing of some of the raw materials, and that will definitely cascade into our business, depending on our contracts. I think the most important thing strategically is to get to new chemistries that have a lot less expensive materials in them. And we see that right around the corner at Ford. And we're changing our launch timing to take advantage of that. Operator : Our final question today is from James Picariello with BNP Paribas Exane. Please go ahead. James Picariello : Hi everyone. Just back on Joe's question regarding this year's heavy slate of model launches. I know the hyperfocus is on improved launch quality. I believe, Jim, you mentioned at some point Ford Pro lost $1 billion in profit last year from a more delivered Super Duty launch, excluding the impact from the strike. My question is, we already saw the F-150 refresh this quarter result in 60,000 units getting pushed. Is there a risk to Ford Blue's guide from lower launch volumes? Is this already factored into the range or is it mainly expected Ford will avoid any material slowdown from here? John Lawler : It\u2019s already factored in. James Picariello : Already factored in. Okay. That was easy. Can you also -- can you just unpack how the implied ASP for Model e in the quarter finished in the $10,000 to $14,000 range? And then just given the slow volume start to the year, should we still be expecting modest full year growth for Model e? John Lawler : Yes. We expect high single-digit growth in the Model e, primarily with the launch of the Explorer, as Jim mentioned, in Europe. When you look at the average selling price with the math, it's difficult because of the quarter. So we had quite a few units in stock. And as we saw the competitive pricing in the industry come down, we took our prices down, too. So then we had to take the prices down of all units in stock equally, and that was about $300 million of impact there. So when you look at the tenth of revenue for the quarter for Model e, you need to add that $300 million in, if you want to do the math based on the wholesales in the quarter. James Picariello : Got it. Maybe my first question doesn't count, given how you answered. Just on the $2 billion in material manufacturing cost savings for this year, I know there are not going to be clean numbers that stand out in the bridge quarter-to-quarter, but can you just give a high-level assessment on the progress to date? What initiatives are really showing through? And any color you're willing to share on first half versus second half timing on those initiatives? Thanks. John Lawler : Yeah. So majority of them are going to be towards the second half. I'm really encouraged by the progress that Kumar and the industrial platform are making around the design changes. And those design changes are trying to be implemented as we get the new model year changeover in the second half and as we bring vehicles online in the second half. So that's one area where I've seen tremendous progress by the Ford teams. They're working on those design reductions to come through. The other area we're seeing progress is in manufacturing, and Bryce and his team as they're working to drive efficiencies to help offset the increases we have this year based on the contract that we signed last year. So in both areas, I'm seeing green shoots there. And Liz is doing a really nice job on the supply chain side as well. We've got better systems and tools and processes. We're working more collaboratively with the supply base. She's changing the culture. And so across all three of those areas in the industrial platform between what Kumar is doing, leading the team with Bryce and Liz, we're seeing green shoots, and we're confident on the $2 billion this year, but mostly timed towards the second half. Jim Farley : And one of the most important priorities for us as a team is to take that cost out and improve quality at the same time. So on the design side, for example, we have specific windows where the team can make design changes and not to protect our quality. I just want to emphasize that because we're trying to do both at the same time, improve quality and improve our costs in the industrial system. And to do that, we have to be very intentional. James Picariello : Thanks. Operator : This concludes the Ford Motor Company first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, Gary. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO; and John Lawler, Vice Chair and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&A is Cathy O'Callaghan, CEO of Ford Credit. Today's discussion includes some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck, and you can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on page 20. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow on an adjusted basis. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Farley : Thanks, Lynn. And thanks for joining us. First, I wanted to thank our global team. Remaking Ford into a high-margin, high-growth, more capital-efficient and a more durable business is really hard work. It requires focus, collaboration and excellence. And I also want to thank our investors. We're committed to creating value consistently over the long-term, and we appreciate your support and input. Execution against our Ford+ plan allows us to break free from the low-margin, capital-intensive and cyclical attributes that have constrained auto -- legacy auto valuations for a long time. And this process does not happen in a straight line. We are absolutely a different company than we were three years ago. And our pace of change is intensifying. The creation of Ford Pro, Blue, and Model e have been a huge catalyst for transparency, accountability and more rigorous capital allocation. Our Ford Pro business is amazing. It's a high-margin business tracking towards $70 billion in revenue this year with further opportunities for profitable growth outside of vehicle sales, parts and service and software. And a good example of that is a recent decision by our team to add 100,000 units of capacity of Super Duty in Canada. It not only serves our customers, but it's capital-efficient and has very high returns for many years to come. As you know, we flipped our international operations many years ago from deep losses to now profits and positive cash flow with more opportunities ahead, and that includes China. We also took our product portfolio from too many generic vehicles and infused it with passion and purpose. We build out our iconic F-Series and Transit lines, as well as passion vehicles like Mustang and the new Bronco lineup, and sub-brands like Raptor and Tremor and Dark Horse. Few OEMs can offer a customer choice like Ford at our scale. Ford is number one in our home market for internal combustion. We're number two in EVs and have been for 2.5 years. And we are the number three hybrid brand in the U.S. But what's less visible, but incredibly important for investors is the foundational work underway in the company to move to software-defined vehicles and breakthrough digital experiences. And I'll talk about that later, but this will have significant operating leverage. Ford+ is on track. Today we reaffirmed our adjusted EBIT guidance for the whole year and raised our outlook for adjusted free cash flow. I'm going to comment on our EV landscape and strategy, software technology and services that are growing importance at Ford, our Ford Pro business and quality. On electrification, we've been very vocal about why electric vehicles are so important and a great choice for customers and businesses. Customers' usage data and cost of ownership data would indicate about 50% of customers who buy automobiles would be better served on buying an electric vehicle. Now there's a lot of misconceptions around EVs on the separate areas of costs like resale value and insurance, of course range and charging and battery life, and OEMs like Ford must do a much better job in educating our customers about the advantages that EV offers in terms of cost of ownership. As you know, we are the number two EV brand in the U.S. for over 2.5 years. That's a long time, and we've learned a lot and now we have used those learnings to sharpen our strategy. What we learned is that it's incredibly important to be transparent about Model e losses. Inside the company as well forces this forced accountability, and the result is our team is getting much more strappy and resourceful in terms of turning the business around. We are now more disciplined and have to be for capital and expense. And this means we will not launch vehicles at a loss that are not good for our business knowing what we know now about the reality of the market equation. And we clearly see China and Tesla as the cost benchmark. We also see excess capacity that will lead to more pricing pressures, which is in our business plan, more consolidation and many, many more partnerships. We see less vertical integration in some areas to relieve capital, and we see a lot of tough choices on footprint. Early majority customers are really different than the early adopters, particularly in retail. And we see a lot more openness to hybrids and extended-range electric vehicles we call E-REVs. We also see a divergence on electrification adoption between commercial and retail. Commercial customers focus on total cost of ownership. They use the vehicles much more intensely and they do not overbuy batteries that retail customers do. They're also investing in our Pro charging depots and our integrated software because they want to be smart about the cost of charging their vehicles. And I'm happy to say that our EV Pro contribution margin for our EV vans is now already positive. We also have learned a lot about the size of the vehicle. We believe smaller, more affordable vehicles are the way to go for EV in volume. Why? Because the math is completely different than ICE. In ICE, the business we've been in for 120 years, the bigger the vehicle, the higher the margin. But it's exactly the opposite for EVs; the larger the vehicle, the bigger the battery, the more pressure on margin because customers will not pay a premium for those larger batteries. And lastly, compliance. There is a lot of pressure on compliance. And the lower demand for EVs, especially the pricing, means that CO2 credits are now likely going to be needed for fleet flexibility and optionality and will be a critical strategy choice for any company. What are the success criteria's for EVs in the future? Well, the first one is to have the right mix of fully and partially electric solutions. This is imperative. You have to have a compelling product roadmap and you have to have very flexible manufacturing. A good example is our hybrid business. The global hybrid portfolio at Ford is on track to grow 40% this year across nine nameplates. And we really bet on hybrid trucks. In the first half of the year, our hybrid pickups, Maverick and F-150, grew more than three times the rate of the overall hybrid segment. Our F-150 hybrid with Pro Power onboard is a game-changer for our customers. Commercial customers have power on the run like job sites, and our retail customers have emergency power backup. And boy, have we seen that in Texas and all the other extreme weather events, how important that is for our customers. The second success factor is matching the cost of the Chinese OEMs and Tesla, especially on affordable EVs. Now when people hear about affordability and they think about small and unaffordable, I'd like to address that now. We are designing a super-efficient platform, leveraging innovation across our product development, supply chain and manufacturing teams. With no engine or drivetrain, a smaller vehicle can have a much roomier package, actually the interior package of a class above, with a small silhouette. That's a big advantage for customers versus ICE. And we're focusing on very differentiated vehicles priced under $40,000 or even $30,000. And we're going to focus on two segments : work and adventure. And why does this matter? Well, the use case for smaller vehicles, affordable vehicles means shorter trips, more urban locations. It fits the duty cycle of an EV. And affordability, well, smaller batteries have an outsized impact on the cost and margin of the vehicle. And the consumer tax credit in the U.S. become a much larger part of the sticker price of the vehicle and that is supercharging the lower cost of ownership that EVs have already without it. And finally, we have the ability to leverage this platform across many top hats, which will drive scale and large installed base for our growing software business. And the last success criteria is to be really careful about your larger EVs. For us, they'll be part of the picture, but success requires even more breakthrough on a cost efficiency, much smarter choices on segments, in our case, work and commercial, a lot of partnerships and a lot of technology pathways. Overall, the EV journey has been humbling, but it has forced us to get even more fit as a company, including applying it to our ICE business, and that will pay off long run -- in the long run. I am so happy we scaled 2.5 years ago, and we have the option to incorporate those learnings into our next generation of EVs launching in the coming years. I want to double-click on the software technology and services business. Ford, alongside Rivian and Tesla, are really the only non-Chinese OEMs controlling software across all the vehicle domain. Most companies are doing OTAs on vehicle entertainment. Ford now has multi-year experience on updating powertrains, braking, the fundamental performance of the vehicle and connectivity. And the breadth of our portfolio, including F-150 and our Pro business, the customer use case is clearly much more complicated than Rivian and Tesla. Our vehicles are increasingly general-purpose computers capable of delivering the type of application environment, AI for our customers and user experiences that we expect from all of our digital devices. And this allows us to create powerful, connected, ever-improving customized experiences, which I'll talk about. Many of you may be surprised that Ford leads on OTAs. According to the 2024 OEM OTA capability rankings in North America, we are the leader based on quality of our updates. This is not how many updates we do, although we do a lot. It's about the ability to improve the fundamental performance and capability of the entire vehicle and all the modules in the vehicle. And there's no better evidence than Mach-E. Longer range, better efficiency on the battery, faster zero to 60 times, better BlueCruise performance, we've done it all with Mach-E for many years now. Our vision is not just a powerful computer on wheels. It's actually a robot. We will link with these digital experiences. Things that only a vehicle can really do, like safety and security, and the other innovative use cases we shared with you at Capital Markets Day. These experiences that will drive higher profitability, accretive revenue and are the reasons for customers to actually stay with Ford and Lincoln, lower marketing costs, are now becoming clear to us. One example on the retail side on the technology is our first implementation of the Phoenix system, we called the Lincoln Digital experience with our new panorama display in our new Nautilus. This experience is really a differentiator in the luxury space with Google Maps and Google Assistant and enhanced carplay. Our sales have surged for Nautilus 48%. We now have much younger customers. And the biggest application for this technology is BlueCruise and ADAS. It's a leading hands-free driving technology in America, we believe. We now have 415,000 enabled vehicles on the road. That's a 25% increase in one quarter. We have 213 million miles, three-million-plus miles of hands-free driving now since launch. To better dimension our progress of software technology and services; in the quarter alone, total company paid subscriptions grew 40% to over 765,000 paid subscriptions. Our integrated service revenue is now on track for double-digit growth this year. We are targeting $1 billion of revenue next year for our software. This revenue has gross margins of 50-plus-percent, which drives significant operating leverage and improved capital efficiency. Now the major part of this new software business is actually Ford Pro, so let me touch on that. The foundation of Pro is really simple. It's our vehicles. A robust and fresh lineup, the freshest we've ever had at Ford of ICE, hybrid and EVs, including the all-new Super Duty, the all-new Ranger globally, the all-new F-150 that has just finished its launch, the all-new custom Transit in Europe, and our two small vans in Europe, the new Transit Connect and Courier, and the new extended-range two-ton electric Transit we sell in both Europe and North America. Now what these brand -- these brands and vehicles are seeing is resilient revenue streams based on a much longer tail spending on the infrastructure by government and private enterprise. We also have a very robust and diverse customer range. We dominate in small business and medium business with tradesmen, but we have very large customers. We have state, local and national governments. And we have rental, which by the way, is very profitable for Pro. In fact, in the U.S., one out of four of these fleets, mom-and-pop tradesmen, all the way to large companies, one out of four of those fleets are U.S. -- in the U.S. are Ford only. But the big opportunity for Pro is beyond vehicles and that's where we're focusing. With Pro Power Intelligence, we have a highly differentiated telematics offering. We offer real-time driver coaching, which provides significant improvements for driver safety and now is available in about half of our modem-enabled Pro vehicles. This includes features like seatbelt and speed monitoring and harsh braking notification. Pro Intelligence is also a platform for vehicle controls. Our first foray, it's a big deal, is Fleet Start Inhibit, which protects our Pro vehicles from theft and also unauthorized use. We will expand these vehicle controls to speed control and acceleration limits in the near term. Now, no third-party telematics solution can offer this functionality because it's related to the vehicle. We call it uncrossable moat for our software business. Over four billion miles have now been traveled in the first half of this year on vehicles equipped with Pro telematics, insights and controls. And our paid subscriptions for Ford Pro Intelligence grew 35% year-over-year, now including 610,000 paid subscriptions with a triple-digit growth in telematics fleet management and charging depot software. Turning to physical service, which is the second big non-vehicle revenue and profit for us at Pro, we have a massive opportunity to grow physical services of parts. In the first half of this year, Ford Pro was only 24% of our after-sales revenue. It's a huge upside. Bank of America estimated the profit pool for maintenance, repair and parts, physical repair of the vehicle that escape our dealer network is about $135 billion. That's 2.5 times the profit dealers capture through vehicle sales and financing. This is a huge untapped TAM. Ford Pro already has the largest physical and mobile service network in North America, but for specialized commercial service, many of which is open 24/7 for our customers with specialty technicians. And we continue to expand that physical network to a competitive advantage by adding Pro Elite centers and mobile service units. We are on track this year to reach 27,000 commercial service base by the end of this year. That is up 20% year-over-year. Growth will be led by Elite base, the largest and most capable of the service base for Pro, which will more than quadruple this year to 1,300. We are now on track to increase our mobile service units by 45% to 2,500 service trucks and vans. That's 10% of our entire physical network. Mobile service network is incredibly important competitively. None of our competitors offer this kind of scale. We address many repairs, limiting our downtime for our customers. We service multi-make fleets, which helps us with our share garage unlike our competitors. And global mobile repair orders that generated from this fleet is up 115% in the quarter. Our focus on software and physical service expands the moat for Pro, while helping our customers improve productivity and grow their business. Pro is on track for software and physical services to contribute 20% of our EBIT by 2026. On quality, we're making progress with our latest vehicles. Ford jumped 14 points in the latest J.D. Power's 2024 U.S. Initial Quality survey. We went from 23rd in the industry to ninth. Bronco Sport is now named the best small utility in initial quality, outperforming 18 competitors. Our launch in initial quality are leading indicators for warranty in the future and we expect to see benefits in the future. We did see warranty cost increase in 2Q, of course, tied to new technologies, FSAs and inflationary pressures for the cost of repair. We expect technology-related warranty costs to now normalize, as technology matures and we deploy that great OTA capability to address known issues. We are confident we are on the right trajectory with a very clear and non-negotiable mission at Ford to deliver best-in-class quality. I'll close with this. The remaking of Ford is not without growing pains, but is unlocking opportunity to serve our customers in growing ways we never thought possible. My confidence comes from the fact that we have built a world-class team, and we are executing a compelling strategy. No other company has Ford Pro. We intend to fully press that advantage. No company has a more compelling product lineup with an attractive mix of ICE and partially and fully electric options for both work and retail customers. We also know we have a lot to prove. We look forward to proving our EV strategy out. That has become more realistic and sharpened by the tough environment. Thankfully, we scaled years ago. We are confident we can reduce the losses and sustain a profitable business in the future with everything we've known. We look forward to proving that we can be profitable on smaller vehicles as well, not just on EVs, but across all of our powertrain choices. It's time to prove our recent quality gains are repeatable and will flow to the bottom line. Plenty of work ahead, but the direction is crystal clear to us. We are building a high-growth, high-margin, more capital-efficient and more durable Ford. John? John Lawler : Thanks, Jim. And I want to thank the entire Ford team for their hard work and continued focus on executing our Ford+ strategy. And more importantly, we are working aggressively to remake Ford into a higher-growth, higher-margin and more durable business, as you said. And frankly, a higher-performing company. Our automotive business is solid and consistently generating strong free cash flow, which is a core ingredient to drive total shareholder returns over time. Now in the quarter, we generated nearly $48 billion in revenue, with growth of 6%. Wholesales were up 2%, as our fresh and compelling product line gave our retail and commercial customers unmatched freedom of choice. The quarter benefited from record Transit wholesales, as well as the completion of our all-new F-150 launch, including drawdown of the inventory we had held at the end of the first quarter. We delivered $2.8 billion in adjusted EBIT, with a margin of 5.8%, as higher costs were partially offset by the continued strength in Pro. Costs were up year-over-year, primarily reflecting an increase in warranty reserves, higher new product-related material costs and higher manufacturing costs. Now if you take a step back and look at our sequential performance, Q2 saw revenue growth of 12% on a 9% increase in wholesales, driven by higher truck volume and the strength of our product portfolio. Despite this revenue growth, EBIT was flat, reflecting primarily higher warranty and manufacturing costs related to the inventory, which was driven by seasonality and the high-volume launches. We remain on track to deliver $2 billion of material, manufacturing and freight efficiencies over the full year, which will partially offset higher labor and product refresh costs. We are seeing emerging headwinds in warranty and inflationary pressures in Turkey, and we are working to mitigate these costs. Now, I have more confidence in today's business than ever. Our strong global product lineup is differentiated and driving continued top-line growth. And we're slowly but surely improving our industrial system and shedding behaviors that have held us back in the past. We're on track to deliver our full year guidance, and we are generating stronger and more consistent cash flow than just a few years ago, evidence that our Ford+ plan is working. Adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion in the quarter and $2.8 billion through the first half, resulting in a cash conversion rate of 51%. Our $1 billion increase to adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year underscores our growing confidence in the business. Our balance sheet remains strong with close to $27 billion in cash and $45 billion in liquidity, providing considerable flexibility in a very dynamic environment. I'm also pleased to announce that we declared our third quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share payable on September 3d to shareholders of record on August 7th. Now let me spend a few minutes summarizing the financial performance of our customer focus segment and highlight how each of them is driving Ford+ and making our business stronger. Ford Pro delivered a 9% increase in revenue on a 3% increase in wholesales. The segment has consistently delivered year-over-year revenue growth each quarter since we re-segmented our businesses. EBIT was a solid $2.6 billion with a healthy margin of over 15%, reflecting increased Super Duty and Transit volume that are both capacity-constrained along with higher net pricing. Ford Pro is the prototype for sticky high-margin, non-cyclical revenue. Pro's results this quarter continue to demonstrate consistency, predictability and resiliency of this higher-margin growth business. Ford Model e generated a loss of $1.1 billion as continued industry pricing pressures and wholesale decline -- wholesale declines of 23% more than offset lower cost. Our team's intense focus on cost delivered about $400 million in savings to the bottom line in the quarter. Key factors included reductions in material costs, improved battery economics and lower engineering. This builds on the cost reductions we have achieved since the launch of our first-generation products, helping to improve our profit outlook as we head into '25. Ford Blue revenue grew by 7% on a 3% increase in wholesales, led by growth in trucks and strong pricing. Wholesales were impacted by the launch of the Explorer as we ended the quarter with about 21,000 vehicles in inventory for quality checks. EBIT of $1.2 billion and a margin of 4.4% were both down year-over-year, mostly driven by higher warranty. Once again, Blue was profitable in every region. Our hybrid sales, up 34% in the quarter, continue to shine and our global hybrid mix is now approaching 9%, up over 2 points year-over-year with more products on the way. Ford Credit generated EBT of $343 million, down slightly year-over-year. As expected, auction values declined by 9%, and lease return rates continued to normalize from historic lows. Credit losses and insurance losses were also higher, but mostly offset by an improvement in financing margin. We continue to originate a high-quality book with U.S. retail and lease FICO scores again exceeding 750 for the quarter. Our exposure to EV residual risk is low as EVs represent less than 5% of our lease portfolio. So now let me turn to our outlook. As I referenced earlier, we continue to expect full year company adjusted EBIT in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion. In general, we see supply and demand for vehicles in balance. And industry dynamics, including market equations for our four segments, are playing out similar to what we forecast at the beginning of the year. We are increasing our adjusted free cash flow guidance by $1 billion to $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion, supported by strong earnings and lower-than-planned CapEx. We are keeping our CapEx target range of $8 billion to $9 billion and are focused on delivering at the low end. Our outlook for the year assumes a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the U.S. and Europe. Our planning assumption for the U.S. is 16 million to 16.5 million units. Full year of customer demand for all-new Super Duty contributing to better market factors for Ford Pro. Lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we move through the second half of this year. For Ford, we expect this to be partially offset by top-line growth from the launch of our new products, warranty reserve increases from software, higher repair costs and FSAs. Our segment outlook anticipates continued Ford Pro strength, and we are increasing our EBIT range to $9 billion to $10 billion, reflecting further growth and favorable mix, partially offset by moderated pricing. As expected, losses in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion for Model e, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new vehicles. And for Ford Blue, we are trimming our EBIT range to $6 billion to $6.5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and higher warranty. We expect Blue's profit trajectory to significantly improve in the second half, reflecting higher volume with the F-150, Explorer, and Ranger launches that we've just recently completed, and our recent capacity expansion on Bronco. And we expect Ford Credit's EBT to be about $1.5 billion, double-digit growth year-over-year. Now our performance this quarter demonstrates the positive progress on our Ford+ plan. We're disciplined with capital, and we have the right portfolio of products, and we are delivering consistent cash generation to reward our shareholders. We are relentlessly seeking out new ways to make our business better and remain focused on driving improvements in both quality and cost. So that wraps our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of time for questions. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Adam Jonas : Hi, everybody. Jim, you said that Ford is a different company from what it was three years ago, but the stock market really doesn't seem to agree with you at all on that. Stock is down about 10% after hours and around $12 a share. And my team just ran the numbers, Ford ranks 494 out of 500 companies in the S&P on PE. Jim, do you -- my first question is, do you think Ford's stock is good value? Jim Farley : Yes. Yes, we're - Adam Jonas : Then why does your -- then why does your Board refuse to authorize a share buyback? And people on this call, I think they understand the reason, like the family element. But in your opinion, if you're telling me the stock is a good value, and it's like the bottom one-percentile of the S&P, what's the plausible reason why -- do you really think you have better uses of capital than that? Jim Farley : Yes, we do. And I have to tell you that it's hard for people to understand those possible uses of capital, but we have so many exciting businesses to invest in. And Pro is a great example. I'm not going to get into specifics, Adam, but I think people will understand over time how many exciting opportunities there are at Ford. And I'm not just referring to vehicles, I'm referring to non-vehicle activities. We have 27,000 service base. There's lots of opportunities. And as I said, when you look at Ford Pro, I'll just deep dive on that one, and I'm so glad you asked this question, by the way. So Ford Pro is a very, very high percentage of our company's profit. Just look at the ratio between the overall company's EBIT in Pro and our guidance. And then think about our after-sales business, only 24% of our revenue comes from Pro-related vehicles. And we could spend a lot of time talking about this opportunity, but that's why I highlighted in my comments, there are so many places for us to grow Pro on the physical services. They're like 35% margin, but it's hard stuff, right? It's like bays and technicians and a lot of work. We have very exciting electrical architecture investments that we have to make in our future that will really change our ICE vehicles and their revenue potential. Because that revenue won't be just when we sell the vehicle, it will be over time, which we're seeing with Pro already. So I don't want to belabor the point. I'll just tell you there are plenty of opportunities. Anything else? Adam Jonas : Okay. Just a follow-up on Skunkworks. Jim Farley : Yes. Adam Jonas : Your team has made a number of visits to China over the last couple of years, including, I think, just a couple of months back, I believe, you were there. What are you learning from these trips? And specifically, I mean, you mentioned China along with Tesla are the cost benchmark, but do you think Ford can bring to market a low-cost EV profitably without help from your partners in China or is China part of the solution? And if China is part of the solution, then what are you going to do about it? Jim Farley : Yes, great question and an important question for any OEM as the EV market evolves here. Look, we made the bet on CATL many years ago. It was a very important bet for our company to localize LFP cells in North America happen to be in Michigan. We're two years into that project. That is a signature partnership. CATL is the largest battery maker in the world, and they lead iron phosphate cost and reliability. That is a signature partnership that we launched many years ago that we've been working hard on, and Marshall is on track. Look what Volkswagen is doing with XPeng, and many others who are kind of taking a Chinese low-cost platform and using that. That's not our strategy. Our partnership strategy will be on the component side, going deep into the supply chain for IP that is critical and unique. I'm not going to get into specifics, but CATL is one example, and we're going to learn how to do that at the company. We believe that this is essential know-how for the company because the true fitness test for EV profitability will be on these small vehicles. And we have learned from our experience with Mazda and Kia and many others that we have to have this know-how in the company because it applies across all of our vehicles, not just EVs. And the lowest cost is the most important capability. We believe that many of our competitors will turn to their Chinese either independent companies or partners to basically use their platform globally. We learned a lot, not just from China, but from MEB. We've been scaling MEB. We know the cost of Volkswagen. They're one of the leaders in scale. And what we found in that trip and subsequent trips to China is that we have a very competitive battery with CATL, but many of the Chinese players in the lower-cost have very affordable batteries, but they don't have the most efficient design outside of the battery on the other EV components. And our team, the Skunkworks team, we might as well call it a big team now because it's no longer Skunkworks, we're betting on them as our affordable platform. They have really designed breakthrough EV components with our own design that we think are better and cheaper. And we have a very competitive battery localized with the IRA benefit. And the partnership discussion, I think, will -- we think will largely put out in larger vehicles. We think that's where the partnership -- big partnership opportunity really lies. In the commercial vehicles that I talked about, I'm not -- we have nothing to say right now, but this is -- we -- why is the partnership so important? Because the bigger vehicles have this kind of inverted cost, and the partners allow you to be more capital-efficient and have better returns. And that's why we think that the partnerships on larger vehicles will play out as vibrantly as affordable vehicles. Operator : The next question is from Bruno Dossena with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Bruno Dossena : Yes, thank you for taking the questions. I was wondering if you could just contextualize what fundamentally within the organization you think is leading to these persistent warranty issues. And I realize partly it's because it was on a prior industrial system, but just given how frequently the surprise warranty issues keep popping up, how do you have visibility or how can investors really build confidence in an earnings trajectory when, every year the surprise warranty issues keep happening? Thanks. Jim Farley : Thank you. I think the most important evidence, the J.D. Power's IQS, that's a really big point of evidence for everyone. Our internal data, by the way, had been saying that for quite some time. It's now verified. I think that is clearly cutting the initial quality defects to a fully competitive rate, where we're leading some segments, will clearly bring our warranty down over time. But it take -- as you said, it takes time. You got to launch vehicles, you got to get in the industrial system and make sustainable changes. The other one I would say is as painful it is quarter after quarter to have all these great launches, we do not release them until we're happy with the quality and that we've done all the testing. And it makes our quarters lumpy and it's challenging, but it will reduce warranty over time. When you look at the root causes for these issues, and I can go through the hundreds that we go through, it's very clear that these are issues many of which we could have caught at launch. And that is what's happening now at Ford. We have to go through all these launches to find these, and over time we're confident they come down. The other thing we maybe made it more difficult in a way, but better for the company fitness-wise is we put a lot of new technology in our vehicles. And that new technology is difficult for the dealers to diagnose when customers come in and say something is wrong with my SYNC system. They replace modules unnecessarily, et cetera, and that hits our warranty reserves. What we've found though is that this kind of fixing is different than mechanical fixes, where that OTA capability redirected to these defects can really reduce our cost outlays for the warranty -- against the warranty reserves. And we're working all of those cost curves every day for each of our models. John, anything to add? John Lawler : Yes. I think that, there's the lag that you're going to have between the quality improving and the warranty run rates improving. And so, the first step, as Jim said, is the quality improving and we're seeing that in the physicals now. And that lags, 12 to 18 months and we should start to see the warranty coming in. On the prior models, majority of what's coming through our FSAs, we're doing things to fix those quicker, get out in front of them, reduce, the impact of them, but we're working that every day. And it's an issue that the team is focused on, and the encouragement is that the quality is improving and that is the most important thing for the future of the business and the longer run rate of the business. Jim Farley : What we won't do at Ford is reduce our actual cash expense at the expense of our customers. We will fix these problems. We will do the right thing. I don't care if it costs rental cars or whatever. We want to turn these quality issues into positives for our customer experience. Bruno Dossena : Okay, thank you. So maybe to step back, and I think this touches on Adam's Skunkworks questions, but when you compare Ford now to history, earnings are now significantly higher. But the capital base has expanded such that returns really haven't improved. And this isn't just Ford. This is most Western automakers. The earnings part of the equation is only partly in your control, but the structural costs are. So how are you thinking about the trajectory of structural costs from here, even simply, are they going up or down? And B, given this is a similar dynamic for a lot of automakers, and so many traditional automakers are investing billions in R&D, really trying to achieve the same thing with respect to EVs, make an affordable EV at scale to compete with Tesla and Chinese OEMs, why do you think the legacy OEMs are all doing this by themselves? And why aren't there more partnerships? Thanks. John Lawler : Well, I would say that you have to think about how you're going to fundamentally change the development process. I think that's the core thing. It's not necessarily just doing it with somebody else. Sure, we're looking to be as capital-efficient as possible, bring partners in -- partnerships in for capital, but you can do that on components and you can do that in other ways as well. And we know and we've done a lot of work understanding what has kept this industry kind of in that penalty box that Adam was talking about, as you mentioned. We're not capital-efficient, we're lower-margin, we don't grow enough and, we're not resilient and it's a very cyclical business, and we're working to change that. We've walked through the areas that we're doing and attacking to improve those key areas. But it's really about the efficiency of the design, and the Skunkworks team is doing something very different. That team is unique for a traditional OEM, the talent on that team. They're doing an agile waterfall systems integrated design process, which no other global OEM has done, a traditional OEM. And we're really working that to be focused on what can happen from a tech standpoint as well. And that vertical integration really helps us drive to those lowest costs. And we're finding that there's ways to be more efficient in many ways than some of the Chinese by incorporating the technology that the team is able to bring forward and leveraging the know-how that they've had from the last products that they've put forward. So I think there's a lot of opportunity for us with that team and the talent and the change in the process that's not only going to show up when we get to our affordable EVs that are going to come from them, but it's also important to understand that if you don't have that transfer function Jim talked about, the entire company isn't going to improve. And by doing it within the company with that team, we have a much higher probability of that transfer function being successful. Jim Farley : Yes. And I would just emphasize that the ambition at Ford for partnering on EVs is record level high. We're not going to make any announcements in earning call, but this is absolutely a flip-the-script moment for our company. We have done partnerships like Volkswagen. We have learned how successful -- how to be successful with the one-ton Transit that includes an electric vehicle. We really see that opportunity in front of us. But we are not going to partner to the level where we delegate our future and the future fitness for cost competitiveness outside the company. We need -- and if we have a partner, we have to have that transfer function that John mentioned. I would only say that we need as an industry to start focusing equally on the one-time cost investment in the electrical architectures and the transition to digital products. Now the integrated services that we're finding, we have 765,000 paid subscriptions. They were different than our competitors who just basically do it for infotainment. We are basically, you know, productivity on Pro as well as BlueCruise. And to take that to the next level, make that business supercharged, we need to invest heavily in electrical architectures, not just on our EVs, but also in our ICE vehicles and hybrid vehicles. And that will be a one-time investment. And the benefit of that was what I was trying to highlight in my script, which is when the economy turns down, we still have those subscriptions. Our service business, customers turn to that even more in a downturn because they keep their vehicles longer, they have to do more maintenance. These are ways to kind of derisk our exposure to economic cycles. And we have to make OTA, the updated IVI system, the integrated services team, both B2C and B2B, our electrical architectures, these are all basic enablers that go beyond EVs. And the industry is going through that transformation too, and I believe Ford is in advance of others because we have more complicated platforms than Rivian and many -- and Tesla and many of the other OEMs. And because of that, we also have more scale. We have more complexity, but we have more scale. And I think that transition and kind of structural change in the industry is as big as the EV change. We're going to get to $1 billion of revenue, we think, next year on software. I wouldn't have thought of that two, three years ago. Operator : The next question is from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please go ahead. John Murphy : Good evening, everybody. Just to take it back to more sort of the core of the business. Jim, I just wanted to go through some numbers or kind of your take on the Ontario Super Duty capacity add. I mean, obviously, it's a big step-up in capacity for the Super Duty 100,000 units. It seems like current demand would certainly soak that up or absorb that reasonably easily. But I'm just curious, if you think we might be hitting sort of a peak in this truck, what's your sort of view on the ability to kind of sustain these high levels of demand and sell-through? How should we think about incremental margins on that? Because it seems like a $3 billion investment might have a payback of less than two years and then -- Jim Farley : Correct. John Murphy : -- spin out a lot of cash real quickly, so it might be a really, really, really good investment. So I was just wondering if you could talk about that and then also what kind of powertrains those trucks will have. Jim Farley : Yes. Thank you. So powertrain-wise, it will be a diverse powertrain, multi-energy platform. We will -- I'm not going to get into specifics, but you can imagine what we've done with F-150 and Transit Van, we've gone to -- and all of our commercial vehicles, a multi-energy platform. So we will offer customers the choice that we think no other competitor will have. And we're -- we believe we'll be a first-mover, if not the first-mover in multi-energy Super Duty. Look, we saw the $1.2 trillion investment in Infrastructure and the Jobs Act. That is coming home. There's a 5G upgrade that's going now. I think it's close to $300 billion investment. And I think what's -- I'm really glad you asked this question, John, because it's not obvious to people. The real part of our Super Duty business that is -- that has been under constant, supply strains is our chassis business. It's about 25% of our entire Super Duty business, but they are not pickup trucks that people use like what you think in road construction. These are people with bucket trucks doing 5G upgrades, heavy construction. And that is the demand that we have not been able to fill. Ford is -- and I'll give you an example. We dominate ambulance in the U.S. Ambulances tend to use our Super Duty chassis business. The average age of an ambulance in the U.S. is 15 years now. They're all falling apart. We have not been able to service that industry, and now we can with this incremental capacity. And so it's an aged fleet, the chassis business. It's got a ton of investment tails to it still. And we lead in the industry because of our upfitter in the products. And now we're going to take the lead on the multi-energy part. That's kind of the story, and it will be a great payback. And we wouldn't be doing it at Ford unless we thought this was going to -- this demand would last for many, many years to come, John. John Murphy : Okay. And if I could sneak just one more in, maybe for Cathy, on the used residuals or the residuals at auctions. It seems like although down year-over-year, the last three quarters, they've stabilized and started to improve. And I'm just curious what your outlook is there and it just seems like the supply is going to remain relatively constrained in the used market, the late-model used market. So this might be a good guy, not just for Ford Motor Credit, but for resids and potentially, a lift or support for new vehicle pricing. So just what are your expectations there and what are you seeing in the market, Cathy? Cathy O'Callaghan: Yes. So we're seeing auction values down about 9% this quarter year-over-year, but up sequentially about 3%. We're expecting auction values to continue to decline in the second half of this year, and we're also expecting our return rates to increase as well in line with that. John Murphy : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Dan Levy with Barclays. Please go ahead. Dan Levy : Hi, good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to start first with a question on Pro where we're seeing these continued strong results and really pricing is doing a lot of the strength. So I understand all the bits about, pent-up demand and that's really helping and there's really a thirst for these products, but maybe you can help give us some color on the sustainability of this pricing -- product pricing. And specifically, A, how long is this tale of pent-up demand? B, how much of the pricing is contractual versus, let's call it more spot retail, which would be more subject to the market fluctuations? So any color on the trajectory of pricing in Pro given it's had such a strong run. John Lawler : Yes. So when you look at Pro, we've been talking about the fact that the demand-supply imbalance has been, great for the top line and it's been running pretty strong, right? No surprise there. We have been forecasting that we expect as we move into the '25 model year that there will be some of the top line coming off. And that's in our guidance. So we understand that over time, that's going to get chipped away at a little bit here and there. But we also believe that there are very underserved segments like chassis that we're going to be able to provide product to, where there'll be more price stability as we move forward. So we don't see prices collapsing. Now when you look at our business, about, I would say, 60% of it or so comes from the fleets, which are negotiated on an annual basis. Those have remained very strong the last couple of years. I've talked about in the past that we'll start to see what the '25 model year contracts look like as we move through the third quarter. Initial indications are continued, demand beyond what we can supply, but we'll work through that and we'll have an update as we come through third quarter. But, we're seeing demand continue both on the typical fleet contracts as well as through the dealers when it comes to the smaller fleet customers, the fleet tail, we call it, where they're buying two or three vehicles at a time. So we're watching this very closely, but so far with '25, early indicators are positive, but we need to really move through that process much deeper before we can say where '25 is going to fall out. Jim Farley : I wish there were car wars for commercial. Because if there was, we would see the product freshness at Ford be an outstanding situation for us. So aside from kind of the industry backdrop of the industry pricing and the demand, I think one of the most important decisions we made several years ago is to go full in on Pro. So we invested in a one-ton Transit, which is our profit machine in Europe. We invested in new Ranger globally. We invested in a brand-new Super Duty, including chassis, including multi-energy. We invested in new F-150. And we have all these new electric Transit, two-ton Transits. That was very intentional. We did it several years ago and now that will pay off, I believe, as we look into these multi-year contracts. And I -- for Ford at least, it's very important to understand how outsized the freshness of our lineup is at Pro. It's -- I've been here 16 years. I've never seen all of our core products updated within a 12-month period like this. Dan Levy : Great, thank you. That's helpful. As a follow-up, Jim, I'm wondering if you could just address the electrification strategy in light of the November presidential elections. We know, obviously, there's one candidate who's talked about pulling back on the EV mandate, and there could be some implications on IRA or the federal or California mandates. I appreciate you've talked about, the need to have flexibility, and I think you even referenced earlier on the call, that credits will play a role, but maybe you could give us a sense of, where the strategy is. Is your strategy one that's more existential that - and clearly with Skunkworks, it seems to indicate that it is, versus a strategy that is maybe one that's just more meant to reach compliance with a long-term -- longer-term goal in mind, but maybe you can give us a sense of how the strategy might change, if at all, depending on the outcome of the elections. Jim Farley : Yes, thank you. Obviously, Ford has had a lot of history -- a lot of experience and wisdom after 120 years of elections. And I would say think about our strategy this way. We believe that the fitness of the Chinese in EVs will eventually wash over our entire industry in all regions. And so we believe as a company, even if there were short-term adjustments we can make to a compliance-led, lower requirement lineup, we're not going to approach it that way. We really believe what I said, which is that many Americans would find an electric vehicle lowering their cost, not everyone, but a high percent. And we believe that to be fully fit globally, whether it's our Ranger business, our commercial business, anything really, we have to find a way inside the company to be fully fit with lots of partnerships on the supply chain side. And so this is a kind of enduring strategy at the company. It is not a strategy where we handicap the presidential election for the next one and the next one and see what we can get away with the EPA. That is not how we run Ford because Ford has -- Ford didn't go bankrupt. We have been enduring. And the only way we believe to be enduring is to make money on small EVs and commercial. And that's our bet. You'll see it play out in coming years. It's a big adjustment from our Gen 1 products. I'm glad, as I said, we scaled 2.5 years ago because we could learn about the reality of the market equation, which is just requiring us to be more fit and move faster. The EPA could certainly change, but it would take, as John said, several years for -- through legislation and lawsuits for that to change. So even from a compliance standpoint, we can't really count on administrations changing this way or that way. I've been to the Hill many times in the last month, talking to many Republican leaders of the country, and I always say the same thing to them. Please realize that there's a subset of customers that absolutely would save money, and they're also, absolutely, a group of customers who like partial electrification. And Ford's strategy is choice, manufacturing flexibility and choice. We are not going to bet student body left on this or right. We are going to give customers choice. We're going to be flexible manufacturing. That's why we want to be a first-adopter to an E-REV or whatever is next on partial electrification because we want to be first and best at that choice. But on EVs, we need to be fully competitive with BYD, Geely, even our own partner Changan. And the only way for us to have done that is through this small group in California. Dan Levy : Great, thank you. Operator : The final question today is from Ryan Brinkman with Barclays. Please go ahead. Ryan Brinkman : Hi, Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask on the warranty performance that led to the higher cost. I remember a similar issue with higher warranty expense back in 2022, which you then tied to, I think, a transmission installed on vehicles some years prior while noting that the quality on vehicles built more recently had improved. So, I know you're prioritizing initial launch quality, including with the F-150, you discussed at length last quarter, but really any color you could share would be helpful such as, whether the higher warranty provision this quarter relates to a discrete issue like in 2022, or maybe you could share what age cohort of vehicles is driving the higher cost this quarter. And then with that new provision, do you think you've got a better handle now on what future costs could be and the provision in future quarters, it could normalize lower as soon as next quarter, or how would you rate the potential for quality performance in older vehicles to maybe surprise negatively again? John Lawler : Yes, Ryan. I mean that's part of the issue is these are issues that are popping up in the field on these older models. The largest one coming through is on a rear axle bolt for vehicles that were engineered for the 2021 model year was when they were introduced. And if these things come through, at a higher time in service, we're made aware of them, we need to take care of our customers, we go out to fix them. And we have several of those types of things popping up on older models. We got a failed oil pump issue that's popping up on, 2016-launched vehicles. And so it's clear that we had a period of time where the robustness wasn't what it needed to be and that's showing up. And it is hard to predict on some of these units that have been out in the field for quite a while that one of these issues is going to show up, these longer-term durability and quality issues. But we need to work through that. And we do believe that overall, as we improve our near-term quality and that starts to show up in the field, that will allow us to, based on the rules that we have around how we do our accruals, bring down that overall accrual level. So these types of issues if they pop up will have less of an impact overall because our run rate on quality will be improving. Ryan Brinkman : Okay, thanks. And maybe just a follow-up on how your comments there might relate to what Jim was saying earlier about Ford controlling the software stack from bumper to bumper, from all the over-the-air update capabilities. What do these new capabilities mean for your ability to troubleshoot or prevent warranty issues in the future? John Lawler : Those are critical because when you look at some of these things, that have been out in the field for a while that have failed, they crossover -- let's say they launched in a '16 model year was the first year it was done. So it was designed and engineered in '13, '14, '15, launched in '16, and it's been out there for quite a few years. With the connected vehicle and having the digital electrical architecture and us controlling the software across all of the operating domains, we will be able to get signals off the vehicle early to tell us whether or not we're having an issue in certain components. And if we understand that early, we can understand the cause of that and then we can go out and minimize, reduce, get out there earlier and reduce the number of vehicles that are impacted and actually either do an over-the-air update, if we can fix it that way, or do a preventative maintenance type program for folks, which will be much cheaper than a field service action recall where you're replacing components and modules, et cetera. So there's a lot of advantages through that connected data that we'll be able to run through warranty -- the warranty system. That's more on the physical side. On the software side, we'll be able to understand, when things are an issue much earlier and we'll be able to fix them through over-the-air updates, which will be a much lower cost as we move forward. Jim Farley : And during our launches, Kumar and Doug have partnered in a way that hasn't been done at Ford for a while at least, where we are testing vehicles to failure and individual components to failure, which is not our launch standard, but we are now doing that. And we are also looking at the DTC codes off the vehicle, especially powertrain DTCs, and running these vehicles at extremely high mileage, far beyond our standard for launch. And that has caught many, many issues in our industrial system that we've been able to correct before we release the vehicle. It's painful to have all these vehicles over quarter ends, but it's the right thing to do for the company and it is the only way, we believe, in addressing our warranty spend. Ryan Brinkman : Very helpful, thank you. Operator : This concludes the Ford Motor Company's second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome you to the Ford Motor Company Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lynn Antipas Tyson, Executive Director of Investor Relations. Lynn Antipas Tyson : Thank you, Laila. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's third quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are Jim Farley, President and CEO, and John Lawler, Vice Chair and CFO. Also joining us today is Cathy O'Callaghan, CEO of Ford Credit. Today's discussions include some non-GAAP references. These are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix of our earnings deck. You can find the deck along with the rest of our earnings materials and other important content at shareholder.ford.com. Our discussion also includes forward-looking statements about our expectations. Actual results may differ from those stated. The most significant factors that could cause actual results to differ are included on Page 20. Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons are year-over-year. Company EBIT, EPS, and free cash flow are on an adjusted basis. Lastly, I'd like to call out a key near term IR engagement. On November 20th, John Lawler, Vice Chair and CFO, and Sherry House, VP Finance, will participate in a fireside chat with Dan Levy at the Barclays Global Automotive and Mobility Tech Conference in New York. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim. Jim Farley : Thanks, Lynn. Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I want to start by thanking our global team for their commitment to Ford+ and to adding and creating value for all of our shareholders. I'd like to touch on an overview of our strategy and why we believe we're so well positioned versus the competitors in key areas, and John will take you through the Q3 results and full year outlook. Several years ago, we restructured our overseas operations, and our global footprint is a key strength for Ford. We restructured in Europe, South America, India and China. Collectively, in 2018, those regions were losing $2.2 billion and burned $3.4 billion in cash. Now, all of those regions are collectively profitable. We're going to continue to stay laser-focused on cost and getting leaner as a company, but our team won't be distracted by major international restructuring facing other OEMs, especially in China. And speaking of China, we've gone asset-light for a couple of years, as we've told you. We have strong JV partners, and we have a growing export business. In fact, China and its exports are now contributing over $600 million to the company's EBIT this year. Another area of strength is our EV strategy, which I wouldn't trade for any of our competitors. We moved early. We've learned a lot on Gen-1 from our customers, the global market dynamics, and what it requires to be fit to compete. No doubt there's a global price war and it's fueled by overcapacity, a flood of new EV nameplates, and massive compliance pressure. In our home market in the US, no OEM is immune. Since Q1 of last year, EV volumes have grown 35%, while revenues in total are flat at $14 billion. That means the progress on volume has been fully offset by prices. We're expecting roughly 150 new EV nameplates to hit North America by the end of 2026. And some of our competitors are already resorting to very aggressive lease tactics even on the brand-new products, which creates huge residual risk and overhang and brand damage. What we're doing about these market dynamics? Well, we're focused on cost. We've already reduced $1 billion in our EV costs this year. We remade our battery footprint. We trimmed our capacity to -- by 35%, in line with where we think the market will be in a few years. We accelerated the mix of our batteries, emphasizing LFP will be the first one to manufacture in the US, and that battery will leverage the IRA production tax credit. We're shifting new launches, focused on getting the products we do have in our EV portfolio profitable within the first 12 months, and we're deep into the design and engineering of our next-generation vehicles. Boy! are we excited about these coming out in the next few years. In 40 years in the industry, I've seen a lot of game-changer products, but the mid-sized electric pickup designed by our California team has got to be one of the most exciting. It's incredible package and consumer technology for a segment we know well. It matches the cost structure of any Chinese auto manufacturer building in Mexico in the future. How do we know that? Because 60% of the [BOM] (ph) has already been quoted. Another advantage for us obviously is Ford Pro. It's unique because we're combining product strength with software and repair services all linked together. Don't be confused by other press releases on-the-ground game in the commercial market, because what our customers see is that we have reach, a leading product portfolio and incredible software portfolio, as well as gaining strength in our repair services, all of that driving sticky reoccurring high-margin revenues. It turns out, in Pro, our dealer network is one of our key advantages. In the US, we have the largest commercial vehicle network, and that's essential to drive those attach rates to services. And our software is also a competitive advantage. Our paid subscriptions delivered a growth of 50% in revenue, 30% just this quarter, and our gross margins are over 50%. There's incredible upside at Ford for our software to grow our installed base, attach rates and ARPU. Another strength is our diverse powertrain lineup. For example, in the US, the hybrid pickup sales at Ford have more than doubled in the past two years. We now have a nearly 80% market share of hybrid pickups. A lot of our companies shunned hybrids, and now they're scrambling, but it's going to take them years to catch up. Interestingly, in our home market, Ford is the #1 ICE brand, the #2 EV brand, and the #3 hybrid brand. Taking a step back, clearly, our strategic advantages are not falling to the bottom-line the way they should. Costs, especially warranty has held back our earnings power, but as we bend that curve, there is significant financial upside for investors. By design, 70% of the bonuses for our managers is tied to cost and quality, and more than half of our long-term incentives as leaders is tied to TSR. Let me double click on the EV business. We applied lessons really early that we learned on Mustang Mach-E across our lineup. In the last 24 months, we've reduced the Mustang Mach-E's cost by $5,000 per unit. As you know, Mach-E is second to Model Y in this segment for sales and transaction prices despite being in the market now for several years. And we continue to break down the friction or barriers to adoption for mainstream ICE customers. We are the first to join Tesla's Supercharger network, and we'll be shipping about 100,000 adapters by the end of this year. We are the first to offer complimentary home charging and installation. We call it the Ford Power Promise, and we've seen a huge uptick in interest on our website from the Power Promise. But our dealers are also becoming a competitive advantage for mainstream customers. Take, for example, Tim Hovik and his team at San Tan Ford in Arizona. In the quarter, one of the months, they sold 137 electric vehicles. And Arizona is not a ZEV state. These were incremental sales with solid gross profits for the dealers. And we are building on that know-how for the last couple of years in scaling and being #2 across our whole US dealer network. All of our 3,000 dealers are primed to sell EVs now. We have 7,000 trained EV specialists, and 14,000 dealership hours have been spent on EVs now. Our dealer network has already installed 800 fast chargers across the US and Canada, and many more are on the way. Next year, we expect to improve the trajectory of Model e's business through cost, scaling, and we're not trading wooden nickels inside the company for emissions credits. That won't change the economics of our EV vehicles and the company as a whole. Turning to Pro. We're the first OEM to segment our customers between retail and commercial. And it starts by having a great product line up and leaning into the future. About 9% of transit sales are now electric vehicles in the quarter. That's up 1.5 percentage points from a year ago. Our Super Duty has more variance than any other OEM, and we're bundling vehicles and services to provide unique value for our customers. What I mean by that is, about 13% of our EBIT Ford Pro now comes from repair services or software. We think that will grow to about 20% by 2026. We have the largest service network in North America. We're on track this year to add over 4,000 commercial service base and 2,500 Pro Mobile Service units. That, by the way, is up 50% year-over-year. Our mobile repair orders are up 60% year-over-year, and now almost one out of 10 Pro repair orders is done by a mobile service truck. Globally, Ford Pro Intelligence subscriptions rose 30% in the quarter. We now have about 630,000 subscriptions. As I said, that's a revenue growth of 50%. We're adding more and more product functionality and features that third-party software companies can't offer, because it's tied to the product, including remote vehicle lock and unlock, limits to our top speed and acceleration. Yes, we are seeing more pricing pressure on Pro in the second half, but that was consistent with our original guidance for the year. Demand is also in line with our expectations. We're seeing pent-up demand for Super Duty cabin chassis and transit wagons. And then, Ford Blue. Let me double-click for a second on that business. First, we have an incredibly fresh lineup across the globe, and we're going to add to that. We have four key US launches on deck. The Maverick and Bronco will be launching in the fourth quarter with new derivatives and a freshened product, and we have an all-new Expedition and Navigator launching early next year. In Q3, in the US, our share was up 40 basis points to 12.6%. Our ATPs in September were in line with the industry, and the Ford brand continues to transact higher than the average non-premium brands. Now, let me unpack the inventory. We ended the quarter with 91 days of gross stock and 68 days of dealer stock. That's a little higher than our target range of 50 to 60 days, but the mix is really good. Now, we're intentionally holding extra inventory through the year-end to protect sales during the Q1 launch activities that I mentioned. And adjusting for that, we're right in the target range for us as we start 2025 from an inventory standpoint. The biggest opportunity of the company clearly is cost and warranty. We're attacking both of these, and we will realize the upside. The biggest opportunity is warranty. And here's some evidence of things on the input metric side that are really improving. Our 3 MIN -- MIS, or three months in service, quality is getting a lot better, a 31% increase in the last three years. This year, the high-volume vehicle lines like F-150 and Escape had huge launches and really had no -- virtually no warranty spike. J.D. Powers typically sees a 92% increase in defects during a launch. Our launch production losses have also been cut in half from the last year, and these are very large-scale launches like F-150 and Explorer. Another key improvement that we're seeing is our ability to OTA and improve our vehicles in the field. We've updated 4 million vehicles at Ford this year and 20 million total since we started doing OTAs. We can now update 30 different vehicle modules, well beyond the SYNC in infotainment modules. The OTAs, on average, save our customers five to six waiting days waiting for repairs and, of course, it lowers our cost of warranty. All improvements to warranty will take time to reduce our warranty expense, maybe up to 18 months, but we're moving the needle on all the inputs. Taking a step back, I believe we're in a very strong competitive position. We have a lean and profitable international business with no distractions. We have a fresh and appealing lineup, which will get even fresher. We have a strong and diversified powertrain strategy that gives customers choice and gives us the flexibility and reach. We're already on our second generation of electric vehicles. They'll be launching in the next couple of years. We'll reduce the losses short-term on our Gen-1 products and set us up to be a global competitor in the long term. We have a vibrant growing software and repair business for Pro, and Pro is clearly a strategic advantage for the company. We're going to keep doing the hard yards to capture the tremendous upside in cost and warranty defects present to us and we're going to bring it home for our valued investors. John? John Lawler : Thanks, Jim. In the third quarter, wholesales were flat, while revenue grew by 5% to over $46 billion. That's our 10th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. And this is supported by our compelling product lineup offering, freedom of choice to both our retail and commercial customers. The quarter benefited from strong truck sales, including hybrids, as well as the launch of the all-new Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator. We delivered $2.6 billion in adjusted EBIT, with a margin of 5.5%, up 50 basis points from a year ago. The profit improvement was driven by higher volume and favorable mix, partially offset by expected EV pricing pressures and adverse exchange. Overall, costs were lower in the quarter. I have great confidence in today's business and the changes that are underway. Several years ago, we proactively restructured our global product lineup and tailored it to focus on customer segments we know [best] (ph) and lead in, which has driven consistent top-line growth. We're also slowly but surely improving our industrial system and shedding behaviors that have held us back in the past. And our free cash flow is stronger and more consistent than just a few years ago. All evidence that our Ford+ plan is working. Adjusted free cash flow was $3.2 billion in the quarter and $5.9 billion year-to-date, with cash conversion of 74%, well above our targeted range of 50% to 60%. Our balance sheet remains strong with almost $28 billion in cash and $46 billion in liquidity. We continue to believe that it is prudent to have extra cash on hand during this unprecedented time in this industry and provides us flexibility to invest in accretive growth, execute strategic build partner buy opportunities, and maintain financial flexibility during the next economic cycle. I'm also pleased to announce that we declared our fourth quarter regular dividend of $0.15 per share payable on December 2nd to shareholders of record on November 7th. We target to return 40% to 50% of adjusted free cash flow to shareholders annually, and including today's announcement, have paid out over $10 billion to shareholders since the beginning of 2022. Now, let me turn to our segments. Ford Pro delivered close to $16 billion of revenue in the quarter, up 13%, another quarter of growth. Wholesales were up 9%, aided by the launch of the all-new one-ton Transit Custom in Europe and robust demand for Super Duty and two-ton Transit vans. EBIT of $1.8 billion was up year-over-year with a healthy margin of 11.6%. Ford Pro continues to be our prototype for sticky high-margin, non-cyclical revenue, paid subscriptions, attach rate and monthly ARPU were up in the quarter. Pro's results continue to demonstrate the consistency and resiliency of this higher-margin growth business, underscored by their year-to-date EBIT margin performance of 14.6%, in line with our long-term target. Ford Model e generated a loss of $1.2 billion. We delivered $500 million of year-over-year cost improvement, which was offset by industry pricing pressures. Global wholesales were down 11%, reflecting our focus on yield management and balancing dealer inventory in North America, offset partially by the launch of the all-new Explorer EV in Europe. Our team is focused on delivering further cost reductions, optimizing the Gen-1 market equation, and driving capital efficiencies, helping to improve our profit look -- outlook as we head into 2025. Ford Blue revenue was up 3% in the quarter, while wholesales were down 2%, driven by discontinued low-margin ICE passenger vehicles. Although overall volume was down, North America volume was up 8%, driven by key nameplates like F-150 and Ranger. EBIT of $1.6 billion and margin of 6.2% were both down year-over-year due to adverse exchange and higher manufacturing costs, offset partially by lower warranty expense and higher net pricing. Hybrid sales up 30% in the quarter continue to shine and our global hybrid mix is still on pace to approach 9% by year-end, up over 2 points year-over-year with more products on the way. Ford Credit generated EBT of $544 million, up $186 million year-over-year, driven by an improvement in financing margin and higher receivables. Auction values declined 1%, and lease return rates continue to normalize from historic lows. We continue to originate a high-quality book with US retail and lease FICO scores again exceeding 750 for the quarter. Our exposure to EV residual risk is low, with EVs representing less than 10% of our lease portfolio in the US. So, let's turn to our outlook. When we began the year, we expected full year company-adjusted EBIT of $10 billion to $12 billion. Since then, our product portfolio has exceeded our expectations, delivering favorable market factors, including mix through the first nine months of the year, and we expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter. This speaks to the strength of our key nameplates and the resilience of our commercial business at Ford Pro. We are also on track to deliver $2 billion of cost efficiencies within our industrial platform, offsetting expected higher labor and product refresh costs for the year. However, two gating factors keep us from a record adjusted EBIT this year, higher-than-expected warranty costs and the impact of inflation at our JV Ford Otosan in Turkey, which increases the material cost of transit vans sold in Europe. While inflationary pressures in Turkey is outside of our control, increased warranty costs are within our control. We now expect full year company-adjusted EBIT of about $10 billion, which includes lower-than-planned volume in the second half for Ford Pro and Ford Blue due to supplier disruptions. In general, we see supply and demand for vehicles in balance. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow of $7.5 billion to $8.5 billion, with CapEx between $8 billion to $8.5 billion. Our outlook for '24 assumes a flat to slightly higher SAAR in both the US and Europe. Our planning assumptions for the US is 16 million to 16.5 million units. Full year of customer demand for all new Super Duty contributing to better market factors for Ford Pro, lower industry pricing of roughly 2%, driven by higher incentive spending as we exit the year. For Ford, we expect this to be partly offset by top-line growth from the launch of our new products. Our segment outlook anticipates continued strength in Ford Pro. We now expect EBITDA of about $9 billion with an improved market equation, including continued pricing strength on core products. An expected loss of about $5 billion for Model e, which is the positive end of our guidance range, driven by over $1 billion in cost improvements that were partially offset by continued pricing pressure and investments in our new vehicle platforms. And for Ford Blue, we now expect EBIT of $5 billion, reflecting a balanced market equation and higher product, manufacturing and warranty costs, partially offset by cost efficiencies. And lastly, Ford Credit's EBT will be about $1.6 billion, a double-digit growth year-over-year. Our performance this quarter demonstrates a positive progress on our Ford+ plan: capital discipline, the right product portfolio and consistent cash generation to reward our shareholders. We are relentlessly working to make our business better and we remain focused on improving both quality and cost. That wraps up our prepared remarks. We'll use the balance of the time to address your questions. Operator : We will now move to our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Mark Delaney : Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the question. Pro EBIT was strong, but did fall to 11.6% in the quarter, although still at 14.6% year-to-date. Maybe you can talk a bit more around what led to the moderation in Pro EBIT during the third quarter and what gives you confidence in that mid-teens EBIT margin in the Pro segment over the intermediate to longer-term? John Lawler : Yeah. So, when you look at it, what we're seeing this year like we saw last year is seasonality in the second [half] (ph). Now there's transparency around the commercial business that we didn't have in the past. And first quarter, we see the peak in the rental business that falls off in second quarter. In fact, this quarter, third quarter, we had basically zero rental business. The other thing we see in the second half is we see the shutdowns that we see at our plants. And as you know, we run these at full capacity. So, we lose those units, and we can't make them up. And that's the seasonality you're seeing, and then you see that show up in the EBIT in the second half. The confidence we have in Ford Pro ongoing is we're continuing to see, as Jim said, strong demand for our Super Duty and Transit, especially the chassis and the wagons. Our pricing has held up pretty strong so far this year. We are seeing some top-line pricing pressure with the '25 model year vehicles as we expected, but we're still continuing to move forward, and it's not something that we're concerned about at this point based on what we're seeing so far with the '25 model years. So, again, the business continues to be strong. And I would tell you that we're really starting to gain traction on our overall process of how we're going to market and we're selling the solution, right? We're selling the vehicle along with the services that come along with that, that's about improving our customers' business and giving them productivity, which helps them improve their profits. So, all of that's coming together and it's leading to a continued strength in Ford Pro. Mark Delaney : Thanks for that. I had one either for you or for Jim around Model e. I think you said during your prepared remarks, you expect improved EBIT trajectory in Model e next year. Maybe you can help us better understand how impactful some of the recent cost and capacity actions the company has taken might be within the Model e segment? And within your outlook for an improved EBIT trajectory within the Model e, how much of a risk might be rising CO2 requirements within Europe and just the broader pricing environment for EVs be as you think about that improved trajectory? Thank you. Jim Farley : Thanks for your question. Good news is we're starting to scale the EV business in Europe and those vehicles are contribution margin positive, and they're becoming a bigger mix of our business. We are definitely getting traction from our cost-down efforts on our first cycle of products, and we're really focused on Mustang Mach-E. We've made a lot of progress, and we have a lot more to make. So, I think this is one of the benefits of having the segmentation broken out, and no doubt about it. I think we tried to highlight in our prepared comments the growing risk for everyone on pricing, and no OEM is immune to that. And as I said, we're seeing some of our competitors have enormous lease mixes like 70%-plus. So, that will play out, especially in Europe, as you said, there's a lot of pressure in Europe. Our products are brand new in Europe. So that's a good thing, and that'll help us next year. Anything else, John? John Lawler : No, I just think that we're going to continue to focus on cost improvements in the current generation and the future generation, and that's -- have being in the marketplace as long as we have, that's really helped frame up the mandate we have for the California team around cost to be competitive. And what it's all going to hinge on is, as you said, Jim, that top-line pricing pressure. Jim Farley : Yes. And to be specific on the cost, we really expect next year and the following years, a lot of progress in the production tax credit for our first-gen products. That's really one of the key levers for us as we've been able to pretty quietly restructure our sourcing of our batteries, where they come from, who makes them to really maximize the PTC. And that will drive a lot of cost down for our existing products. And you'll see that come to fruition starting in mid-next year and all the way through 2027. Operator : Our next question comes from John Murphy with Bank of America. Please unmute your line and ask your question. John Murphy : Good evening, everybody. Just a first question on warranty for -- maybe for both of you. I mean, Jim, you kind of cited some pretty good positive data around J.D. Power, some other sources, but I'm just curious if you're willing to, at this point, kind of ring the sort of the positive alarm bell that we're now kind of all clear on some of the warranty issues we've seen in the past, particularly last quarter, or is there -- I mean, what is the certainty that we're through the worst of this. John Lawler : Yeah, John, I wish I could answer that with certainty. We are seeing the leading indicators, the physicals. We're seeing improvement there, especially around our three months in service. '24 model year is over 30% better than what we saw in '21 and '22. As Jim mentioned, our launch spikes basically on Explorer and Cougar, we did see one. So, those are good indicators that things are going to get better from an overall quality standpoint. Now, it's going to take time for that to flow through from a warranty standpoint. What I can't tell you is, I don't and can't read, and we're doing the best we can on this, I know it's not satisfactory for you guys is the FSAs and the older models, where what could potentially hit us. And we're out looking at all the data we can. We're looking at everything to try to get out in front of any of those. And we're working to increase on our current models, everything we can do to fix things through OTAs, get the repairs out there as fast as possible, cut off any issues that are in the plants. So, I think we're doing all the right things from a physical standpoint. I just can't tell you when that curve is going to bend for sure and how that's going to start flowing through from a cost standpoint. And we're doing everything we can to figure that out and get there and understand the transparency and clarity around that. John Murphy : And then just a second question around pricing. I mean in Blue, it was still, on a net basis, even positive in the third quarter. So, a lot of concern around might have -- what's going on with your inventory, although it sounds like you've answered that question, but also inventory at Stellantis and what might happen in the broader market. So, I mean, as you look at this and you think about pricing, you've got great product coming out now and into next year that should be a bit of an offset. It seems like you'll have the inventory worked out. How do you think about pricing going forward in the industry? I mean, it keeps surprising and being relatively resilient and actually even positive for you guys. So I mean, how do you think about that going forward? John Lawler : Yeah. So, this year, top-line both pricing and volume were a tailwind for us relative to what we had thought. The industry is down 2%. We are seeing increasing pressures as we come through the end of the quarter into Q4 from a top-line standpoint. Your guess is as good as mine, John, as what's going to happen and how deep some of our competitors are going to go that have an issue with inventories. Yeah, our inventories were higher, but we also gained share in the quarter and our sales pace increased. So, we think we've got a plan to manage our inventories. We've got a plan to get back to within the run rate of what we expect. We do have some launches in Q1, so we will carry some higher inventory for those vehicles through the end of the year, but next year, we plan to get back to that 50 to 60 days run rate, for sure. As we move into 2025, there's a lot of water that needs to flow under the bridge still between now and the end of the year. One of the things we're looking at is the consumers in Europe, it seems that they're pulling back a bit and spending less. So, we've got to watch that. And I think many of you guys have written about the fact that, are we heading into cyclical pricing headwinds? And is that going to show up in 2025? As you said, we've all been pleasantly surprised as how it's held up so far, but I want to see how we run through this quarter, how the year-end is coming along, how sales are at the end of the year before I can give you any call on what we think is going to happen with pricing next year. Jim Farley : And the only thing I would add on the pricing is really the mix. We continue to see customers move into small utility, affordable side of EVs continue to be really fuel the unit growth and we're even seeing some change in series mix. So, those are all uncertainties that we have to handicap for next year. But I just encourage all of us to not just look at the top-line or the discounting, but also look at the mix and the segmentation. The good news is the truck segments and the Pro segments are holding up really well. Operator : Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please unmute to ask your question. Adam Jonas : Good evening, everybody. So, the Chinese have really been growing rapidly in Europe and rest of world as you've seen. I know you don't break out results geographically, but any color on any impact you might be seeing in Europe competitively or even in rest of world regions that you wanted to highlight? And specifically, I was kind of surprised you mentioned that China was contributing $600 million to your results this year. I'm curious how much of that was from the domestic market versus reverse exporting from China? John Lawler : Yeah. Adam, I'll start with that and then I think Jim will cover the rest of your question. So, we are profitable in China in and of itself in China. Jim mentioned $600 million of total profits, and that includes our exports, primarily to the rest of Asia and South America. So, going asset-light has allowed us to stay profitable within China. And then, the export strategy, primarily from our JV, our JMC, and exporting those vehicles to the rest of Asia as well as South America is driving significant profit in Ford Blue. Jim Farley : And Adam, for our revenue globally, Ranger has become such a key product for us. We are in so many markets, and the reason why we're profitable overseas is so many of those markets is because of Ranger. When I came to the company, Ranger was 13th, now we're #2 to Toyota Hilux. And in many markets like Australia, we outsell them. So, that's where the pressure is going to show up for Ford's revenue. Great Wall is now localizing in Thailand. They're 60% of the pickup market in China. They're really sharp company with great products and great value proposition. So, we have a great strategy for that, but that's where we see it. In Europe, as you said in Europe, the passenger car market has been impacted, but we really don't compete there. We really compete in the commercial Pro business in Europe. We don't see the Chinese being major movers. [indiscernible] a little bit in the UK, but they haven't really focused on the commercial Pro business. The good thing there is that we have a multi-energy strategy for all of our Transits where we can offer customers whatever they want, including electric Transits, as I said, almost 10% of our products. So, we're well positioned, I think in both locations, for Ranger and Transit. Adam Jonas : Thanks, Jim. Just as a follow-up, John, you cut about $1 billion out of the full year outlook. You provide the detail by your reporting segments, but I was wondering if you could break down what compromised that $1 billion shortfall by factor if I gave you your costs versus your expectations. You mentioned warranty costs are down, but not as much as you thought. You're not satisfied. FX and the supplier disruption, you mentioned you missed some units. I wanted to know if you could quantify that or any other factors by causal factor. Thanks. John Lawler : Yeah. I think, Adam, when you look at it, you've got to look at it on the full year versus where we're guiding down now relative to what we had in Q2, right? And when we guided Q2, we had the headwinds hit us quite hard from a warranty standpoint and we are seeing inflationary costs in Turkey. So, if you just step back on the full year, what's gating us from hitting the record profits is the fact that we have those headwinds that are offsetting the positives we had from a top-line we just talked about, volumes and mix and pricing stronger than we expected. Now, coming out of the second quarter, what we've seen since then, which is gating us now to the lower end of our range is that we're seeing, in particularly, in Blue, we're missing some volume and we're seeing some mix headwinds due to some constraints we have with suppliers. And it's hitting our most profitable, highest-profitable mix vehicles. Some of that is, we lost some production due to the hurricane, but we also have some issues with a certain supplier on their productivity that we're trying to work through. We believe we'll be through that by the end of the quarter, but that is hitting Ford Blue and that's what's pulling Ford Blue down now from a standpoint versus what we guided at Q2. Does that explain -- does that cover it? Operator : Our next question comes from Daniel R\u00f6ska from AllianceBernstein. Daniel R\u00f6ska : Hey, good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Jim, if you take a step back and think about Ford+ and the targets we've discussed over the past, I'm not going to hold you to 10% in '26, but could you still remind us of the stepping stones here for performance kind of in the medium term, and also give us a little bit of your view on how kind of the somewhat slower transition into EV might impact kind of what we've talked about in the past? Jim Farley : Thank you. Well, certainly, our focus continues to be cost and our biggest cost focus is warranty, coverages and FSAs. That is our -- that's always been our work at Ford. I'd say we approached it looking at the most systematic changes that we need to make in the industrial system. And I'm proud of the progress, but we're not satisfied at all, and we have a lot of opportunity. And going into maybe what looks like, in our home market, a little bit of a tougher pricing environment, that's upside for us as a company. And the management team is all focused on that and we're rewarded for doing that work. I would say the EV journey has been really interesting because as much as it's slowed down, I'm really proud of the team reacting really quickly to it. Many of our competitors still have a lot of models coming out. And we made the adjustment really early and those second-generation products will be coming out. In addition to that, we really learned the industrial fitness we have to have in the way the vehicle is designed, the design costs, the design for manufacturability, and that's all in our second-generation products. And I think that's a four-, five-year advantage for Ford. The other opportunity that kind of emerged maybe that we didn't expect was the popularity of hybrids, especially on trucks. Most of our competitors don't offer hybrid on an F-150 or a Maverick, and this has been a fantastic revenue opportunity for us. We frankly can't keep up with the demand. And our -- the reason why we focused our hybrids on truck is because we can innovate for the customer at Pro Power Onboard using hybrid and other advantages than just more efficient propulsion. And I think that has encouraged us to put hybrid across our whole lineup, and be more curious about other partial electric solutions, which we'll talk to you about. I would say the -- this skunkworks team has over-delivered, at least in the designing the platform. Now we have to make it to high-scale production. And I am so excited to show everyone their work because it really shows how a company like Ford can compete with a company like BYD. And I would say Pro has been a really interesting journey for us, because I think it kind of shows the future of the auto industry with attached services, with more focus on aftersales and repair, and software that's kind of tied to the vehicle itself, not just generic productivity software, but software that actually is tied to the vehicle, and to do that, we need advanced electric architectures. But there's been some challenges beyond cost and quality, obviously, and the slow uptake of EVs. Electric architectures are hard to execute. The software journey and the technology for the company is big know-how. We're already at 20 million OTAs. That's going to be a more and more important capability for the company. So, there have been surprises, but I think, as I said, we're really well-positioned in the short and mid-term. Daniel R\u00f6ska : Great. Thanks for that. And maybe, John, to follow up a little bit, if you kind of summarize, there's been headwinds in the short term, EV has been a little delayed. So that ramp up kind of certainly isn't happening maybe quite as fast as you might [Technical Difficulty] stability on the cash side, but could I push you a bit and ask what would make you reconsider kind of the strategy on shareholder distribution? Because we've seen a couple of your competitors kind of be a little bit more aggressive on immediate distributions, be it dividends or buybacks, right, but just as a -- what's the balance you're striking and what would maybe move you, let's say, to increase the dividend again, for example, or to take other distribution actions? What could some of those factors be to tilt the capital allocation towards shareholders? John Lawler : Right. So, we talk about this every quarter, as you would expect. And we're consistent in that we're going to pay out 40% to 50% of our free cash flow. And we do think it's prudent at this point in time to hang on to the incremental cash. We have $28 billion and $8 billion higher than our stated cash minimum that we need is $20 billion. And I think at this point in time, where we're at in the industry, where we're at in the overall economic cycle, the uncertainty around the globe, right now, it's the right thing to hang on to cash. And I'm not saying there's going to be something that happens in the global economy, I'm not saying there's going to be some disruption, but were that to happen, we would be very pleased having this cash in hand. So, we look at it every quarter. We understand that if we don't have a use for the cash or if the environment doesn't change and we see that the risks that might be facing us diminish significantly, then we have to make sure that we handle that cash appropriately and either invest it for an accretive growth or pay it back to the shareholders. And we will look at that every quarter and we will adjust appropriately. Operator : Our next question comes from Joseph Spak with UBS. Please unmute and ask your question. Joseph Spak : Thanks, Jim. Actually, if we could just pick up right there, I want to talk about a little bit about the 40% to 50% payout, because I hear you and Jim's confidence on the business, but I also hear on this call that warranty is something you still don't quite have a handle on and there's some uncertainty there in the US market, it's hard to see how it becomes stronger. You talked about potentially a pricing cycling downwards. Again, not expecting it maybe or necessarily, but it's possible. And if the industry stalls out, obviously, then there's working capital headwinds. We saw how fast free cash flow deteriorates at a competitor. You mentioned higher inflation, there's still some investment that needs to be made. So -- and I know you want to keep cash on hand for optionality. So, when I hear you talk about 40% to 50%, it sounds to me like that's a retrospective view, but I'm actually wondering how much of a prospective view are you considering in that? And like why is 40% to 50% even the right number? John Lawler : Yeah. And we -- of course, we look at both prospective and as well, what we're going to pay out for the year. So, we set the strategy around that payout ratio, 40% to 50%. And we thought -- we think that's a good point to be at right now. And we do look prospectively as to where we see the environment changing, what's in front of us, where the outlook could potentially be the risks, the potential headwinds, potential tailwinds, et cetera. So, we do do that. It's just that at this point in time, we don't have anything to announce. But we're always evaluating it and we're always looking at it. We have the conversation every quarter as you would expect. And once we feel that it's the right time, then we will make a prospective change, a change based on a prospective outlook. Jim Farley : I would only add to John's comment that we're really excited about the Pro services, and we don't have anything to announce, but we're always going to want to have some optionality, not just for running the business, but for strategic optionality to build our services business. I mean, when is a car company had a chance to get the profitability of a Pro business to 20% or 30% of its revenue being services. That is such a special moment for our company and frankly for the industry, but that just doesn't come from organic growth all the time. Sometimes, it takes investments in new kinds of services. I'm not going to go into that, but I just want you to understand that we're also thinking very carefully like we have all of our strategy choices, like going asset-light in China, like restructuring our businesses, like the way we handle the Rivian investment, we're thinking very carefully about our Pro business and how to nurture those services beyond what we have today. Joseph Spak : Maybe just as a second question, I want to go back to Mark's question on European compliance. I know last -- in the last 10-Q, you called out $3.8 billion for regulatory compliance and I reread it this morning and said for North America and Europe for current and future model years. But in Europe, it's really more of a -- right, like there's no credit system, that's my understanding, right, it's a bilateral negotiation maybe for a pooling agreement. So, is that what's being considered in that number? And between a potential pooling agreement and your new BEV portfolio with the Explorer, the Capri, et cetera, do you expect to be compliant next year? John Lawler : Yes. Jim Farley : Yes. And the other thing to think about in Europe or in North America is we tend to talk about CO2 compliance is like one thing is actually heavy duty or light duty as well as a passenger car, and they're very different. And in Europe, that's really important to consider. So, not only are we committed obviously to be compliant, but we also have to think about our heavy-duty compliance in both markets. And that's why we launch -- that's one of the reasons why we're so excited about. We have a whole new line of electric and combustion small vans. We just launched our main van, the one-ton Transit, that's available in diesel, gas and fully electric. So, we obviously giving ourselves the best chance from an offer standpoint as well. But when it comes to CO2 compliance, I hope we start to double-click and not only look at ZEV states in the US, but also look at heavy-duty compliance because it's really -- it's quite different actually. Operator : Our next question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Wolfe Research. Please unmute your line and ask your question. Emmanuel Rosner : Thank you so much. My first question is on the cost reduction program. So, this year's outlook still includes $2 billion in cost reductions for material, freight, manufacturing. You said you're on track for those. How much is it year-to-date? How much do you still need to achieve in the fourth quarter? And then, if we look forward, I know there's a lot of uncertainty into next year and you've discussed them in detail, both in terms of volume and pricing and mix, et cetera, but in terms of things you control, what is sort of like the size of the cost opportunity as you move into 2025? John Lawler : Yeah. So, on the efficiencies that we've brought through this year so far, most of it is through the first three quarters. So, we do have some savings to come through in Q4, but most of it was through the first three quarters. And you would expect that, right, Emmanuel, because there was a large part of that was on the design changes that we made with the launch of the model year. So, most of that's come through. Emmanuel Rosner : And on a go-forward basis? John Lawler : So, as you know as well as anybody and you had identified this morning in your note, we have a tremendous opportunity given our cost competitiveness relative to competition. The question is the rate and flow and how we bend that curve and pull that cost out. It is our number one opportunity to unlock the potential of our Ford+ strategy. We understand that. And we're not going to give any numbers on '25 at this standpoint right now, right? We're in our planning cycle. There's a lot of water, as I said earlier, to flow under the bridge before the end of the year. We'll give that guidance, and we'll give you an update in Q4 earnings for '25 and what we're going after in cost -- on cost from that perspective. But there's a tremendous -- you know this as well as all of you know this that our cost -- our position from a cost competitive standpoint, we have a lot of opportunity there and we understand that and we're aggressively going after it. Jim Farley : For the industrial team, what we're really focused on as we finish off this year and next year is another cycle of our material cost reduction. We had a really -- we've made a lot of progress here, but we also added a lot of new product cost as well. That all is opportunity for us on material costs. So, this will be kind of the second rotation of that as we enter next year. And of course, a double-click or special attention on our EV Gen-1 costs. On warranty, we're really looking at our software warranty costs and the cost of repairing modules as well as powertrain. That's really where the team is focused on warranty. Obviously, we made good progress on manufacturing, but we have a lot more work to do in North America and that includes freight and duty. And then, we're looking very carefully at our should-cost on supply chain with our suppliers, working carefully with them to make sure that we have competitive negotiations and any inflation-related requests that we're dispositioning those to be fair to both the supplier and Ford. And we have dedicated teams on all those areas. We benchmark our competitors from a process and talent standpoint, and that's where we're spending our time as a team. Operator : Our next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays. Your line is open, Dan. Feel free to unmute. Dan Levy : Hi. Sorry about that. Thank you. I want to follow up on the prior line of questions and just ask something a little different on cost. You mentioned or you discussed at your Capital Markets Day, I think it was some 15 -- 18 months ago now that you had the $7 billion cost gap against your competitors, mostly on the material costs. You mentioned that you -- you're getting the $2 billion of cost this year, but you've had other costs come into the system. Where do you think you stand now on narrowing that cost gap? Are you just as confident today that you can narrow that cost gap versus when you originally presented that target? John Lawler : Yeah. So Dan, I think we're in a different position today versus where we were 18 months ago about really understanding the root cause issue of that and what it's going to take to make the changes to get that cost out of the system. And that's been a very fundamental change for us as a leadership team, honestly. Our cost gap versus competition versus then has not closed. That's not to say that we haven't taken cost out, we have. We've taken cost out, but we're not doing it at a pace faster than our competition. So, we go through every quarter, and we update the analysis, we pull apart the financial statements when we get the Qs and at the end of the year with K, we look at the progress we've made versus the progress that our competitors have made. And it largely sits, we've made more progress on material costs, but we've gone backwards on warranty cost. We've made some progress on our structural costs [ASP] (ph), SG&A relative to competition, but other areas have offset that. We've had more inflationary costs because of our joint venture in Turkey with what they've seen with that business. So, it's still a very strong business. It's still the lowest-cost business. We've just seen this increase this year that we weren't planning for. So, we need to move faster, bottom line, and warranty needs to be a big part of that. We need to continue to make the progress on material cost, our manufacturing costs, overall structural costs, as well as driving down the warranty cost. So, it's a humbling position to be in is that, as you said, 18 months later, we haven't closed the gap. Despite taking cost out, our competitors are doing the same thing. They're taking cost out. We need to accelerate our pace to outrun what our competitors are doing. Dan Levy : Thank you. That's helpful color. Maybe as a follow-up, wanted to ask about a comment, Jim, that you mentioned earlier that on the skunkworks EV, you have confidence in the cost because you've already quoted 60% of the BOM. So, maybe you could give us a flavor of sort of what pieces you've seen clear achievements on in your quoting or sourcing that are driving these material cost outs versus maybe where the rest of the industry is and that's enabling you to achieve what you think is structurally lower cost on the EVs? Jim Farley : Yes. So obviously, having a competitive LFP battery is really, really important. Competitive is keyword. The team took a totally different approach to developing the vehicle. And I don't want to get into too much detail, but I'm really proud that we basically verified the design of each part like a year or two earlier than we normally do. And we verified it from the supplier standpoint and ours by looking at a variety of different suppliers, even challenger suppliers. And that has been an eye-opening experience for us to see what really should-cost is on a lot of these advanced components, especially, because we think companies like BYD have an incredible advantage on affordability of batteries. So, we have to make that up, or our opportunity is on the EV component side, inverters, gearboxes, motors, et cetera. And I think it's a combination of very new approaches to the actual design of the component, as well as leveraging new suppliers as well as working way upfront on the part design itself to get the cost out using the technology roadmap of the supplier. And that's where we're seeing a lot of the progress. Basically, the answer to your question is we radically simplified the vehicle. Like, if you look at the number of parts in the vehicle, it is just a completely order of magnitude change. And when you simplify the components to that level, and you really move the design and supplier design phases earlier, you can integrate a simpler design with a better should-cost. That's the high hard one on the skunkworks team. Look, we've done a lot on manufacturing. We have a whole new kitting strategy for the vehicle. We have a unit casting strategy that massively simplifies the stamping of the vehicle. I think a lot of other companies will do that. But what I'm really seeing is an ethos of simplicity and a higher engagement with a broader supply chain earlier in the process than the typical for development cycle.
