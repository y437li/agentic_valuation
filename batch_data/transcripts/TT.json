[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded.  I would like to hand the conference over to Janet Pfeffer, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Ingersoll Rand's First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. We released earnings at 7 :00 a.m. this morning, and the release is posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting, in addition to this phone call, through our website at ingersollrand.com, where you can find the slide presentation that we will be using this morning. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.  If you would please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated. This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. To introduce the participants on this morning's call, Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations.  With that, please go to Slide 3, and now I will turn it over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Great. Thanks, Janet, and good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. In the first quarter, we delivered GAAP earnings per share of $0.27, which included $0.02 of restructuring, translating to adjusted EPS of $0.29. That's $0.01 above the top of the earnings guidance range and a 32% increase versus the first quarter of 2013. Revenues were $2.7 billion, up 3% versus last year. Revenues were consistent with our guided revenue range of up 2% to 3% for the quarter. Orders were up 5% in the first quarter, with Climate up 7%; and Industrial, down 1% against the tough Industrial comp, as last year's first quarter included 2 significant project awards. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring from both years, was up 60 basis points. Climate margins increased 210 basis points. Pricing exceeded direct material inflation, marking 3 full years or 12 consecutive quarters of consistent execution in our pricing capability.  We did experience severe weather in the quarter, which impacted our ability to produce, receive parts and ship in several locations. In most instances, the teams were able to make up those shipments during the quarter. Club Car's performance was the most severely impacted, with 2 significant winter storms in Augusta, on top of an already full first quarter order book. Although the team was able to make up part of the lost days of production, some shipments were delayed until the second quarter. And Sue will give you some more color on Club Car in a few minutes.  Through the tireless efforts of our employees, we were able to overcome such challenges and deliver for our customers, as well as for our shareholders in the quarter. I'd like to thank and acknowledge our employees for their dedication during some very long days and weeks in the first quarter.  We repurchased 13 million shares in the first quarter and have completed the December 2012 $2 billion repurchase authorization. Now Sue will walk you through in more detail in the first quarter, and I'll then take you through our second quarter and 2014 outlook. Susan Carter : Thanks, Mike. Let me give you a high-level summary and then dive into the details. Our bookings for the quarter were up 5%, revenues were up 3%, and our operating margins, without restructuring, were up 60 basis points year-over-year.  Reported earnings per share were $0.27, and adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.29. Versus guidance, pricing and volume were a little bit better and more than offset the operating inefficiencies we experienced due to the weather, taking us $0.01 above our guidance range.  Now let's go to Slide 4. Orders for the first quarter of 2014 were up 5% on a reported basis, and excluding currency. Climate orders were up 7%. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up low-single digits. Transport orders were up high-teens, led by container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 2%, excluding currency. As Mike noted, there were 2 significant awards in the first quarter of 2013, making it a challenging comparable. Club Car orders were up low-single digits.  Now let's go to Slide 5. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, first quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis and 4%, excluding currency. Excluding currency, Climate revenues increased 5%, with HVAC revenues up low-single digits and transport revenues up low-teens. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single-digits. Industrial revenues were essentially flat on a reported basis and excluding currency. I'll give more color on each segment in the next few slides.  On the bottom chart, which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 3% in the Americas, 6% in EMEIA and Asia was up 3%, all excluding foreign exchange. Let's go to Slide 6. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from the first quarter of 2013 of 4.5% to first quarter 2014, which was 5.7%. This chart is on a reported basis, however, we have clearly struck [ph] out the impact of restructuring costs for you.  Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were 20 basis points positive versus prior year. Our pricing programs continue to outpace material inflation, adding 40 basis points to margin. Productivity versus other inflation was a 50-basis-point positive margin impact in the quarter. And this is particularly good performance, in my view, given the inefficiencies we know were experienced from the ERP phase 2 go live, much of which were planned, and the disruptions and resulting inefficiencies from weather. Year-over-year investments in restructuring were lower by 10 basis points in total. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 50 basis points of headwind from investment and a 60-basis-point benefit from lower restructuring costs. So if you'd prefer to look at this on an adjusted basis, adjusted margins increased a net of 60 basis points versus the 120 basis points on a reported basis.  Let's go to Slide 7. The Climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the first quarter were just over $2 billion. That's up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and up 5%, excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up low-single digits. Orders were up in the Americas and Europe, and down in Asia. Trane's commercial HVAC first quarter revenues were up low-single digits. Revenues were up mid-single digits in Europe and Asia and flat in the Americas. Commercial HVAC new equipment revenues were up low-single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were up mid-single digits versus prior year.  Thermo King orders were up high-teens versus 2014 first quarter, with a significant increase in container orders. Thermo King revenues were up low-teens, with truck and trailer revenue up high-single digits and marine container revenues up significantly. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year. Unit volumes were also up mid-single digits and the mix was positive in the quarter.  The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 6.6% in the quarter, 210 basis points higher than first quarter 2013 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Notably, the North American HVAC businesses, commercial plus residential, leveraged at over 200% in the quarter.  Let's go to Slide 8. First quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $682 million, up slightly from last year's first quarter. For the Industrial segment, excluding Club Car, revenues were up low-single digits and orders were down low-single digits versus last year. Revenues in the America and Asia Pacific were up low-single digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were up mid-single digits. Revenues in the air compressor business were up mid-single digits, with strong gains in centrifugal and oil-free products.  Club Car revenues in the quarter were down high-single digits, while orders were up low-single digits versus prior year. Increased revenues from Club Cars were more than offset by delayed shipments in utility vehicles and by lower demand as a result of weather in aftermarket. Club Car's revenues in the quarter were negatively impacted by weather. Cold temperatures across the U.S. negatively impacted demand for their products, as well as aftermarket. Rounds played were down almost 20% year-over-year. In addition, 2 severe storms hit Augusta, Georgia, causing production to shut down for several days in January and February, as well as causing inbound and outbound logistics delays. While in most of our businesses, we were able to compensate for any lost days due to weather by increasing capacity in March, Club Car's seasonal business was already scheduled at full capacity in March, already working multiple shifts in weekends as they do every March. So much of that revenue shifted out of the first quarter. The logistics issues from the storm also resulted in incremental costs incurred for premium freight, less-than-optimal outbound loads and additional overtime.  Industrial's operating margin of 11.6%, was down 320 basis points on flat volumes compared with last year, as productivity was more than offset by the disruptions at Club Car, inflation and investments.  Now let's turn to Slide 9. Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.4% of revenue in the quarter. We normally use cash in the first quarter as we build for the cooling season. First quarter free cash flow was an outflow of $177 million. With revenues in the quarter back-end loaded in March, ending receivable balances were higher-than-expected and will be worked down over the coming months.  Please go to Slide 10. We repurchased 13 million shares for $800 million in the first quarter and, as expected, that completed our $2 billion repurchase authorization. As you know, a new $1.5 billion authorization was approved by the board in February. As we indicated in our last earnings release, we have begun to spend under that authorization in April, utilizing the final portion of the distribution from the Allegion spinoff. Our forecast for the year remains to spend between $1.375 billion and $1.475 billion on repurchase, with $400 million to $500 million of that coming from free cash flow. We expect the majority of that to be spent in the second half of the year. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through guidance. Michael Lamach : Okay. Thanks, Sue, and please go to Slide 11. As you know, the first quarter comprises only 10% of our annual earnings given the seasonality of our businesses. In the aggregate, markets were about where we thought they would be, some a little better and some a little weaker but in total, about in line with our outlook going into the year. You saw that in our first quarter revenues, which were in line with our guidance. Dodge put-in-place forecast for 2014 shifted somewhat in the latest update. The commercial and industrial forecast was revised up, while the institutional forecast was revised downward. In total, the 2014 Dodge forecast is slightly higher. Again, commercial and industrial buildings tend to use more unitary equipment, while the institutional markets tend to use more applied equipment. Single-family housing activity was adversely impacted by weather, although our full year forecast is still from mid- to high-single digit growth in industry unit volumes. Transport markets had a good start to the year, particularly in Europe and in marine. We continue to expect the full year North America trailer market to be flat to slightly up on a unit basis. Industrial markets were fairly slow in the quarter.  All that said, the second quarter is a much more telling quarter from which to gauge the balance of the year. Given that and, as is our normal practice, we're maintaining our full year guidance for both revenue and earnings at this time, and we'll be taking a look at the full year outlook again when we talk to you in July.  Let's go to Slide 12. The second quarter guidance refer to the right-hand column on the chart shown. Second quarter 2014 revenues are forecast to be up 4% to 5%. We expect growth to be stronger in Climate than in Industrial, but both should be in the low- to mid-single digit range. Second quarter GAAP continuing earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.12. Restructuring costs are expected to be about $0.01 in the quarter. So on an adjusted basis, the EPS range is $1.09 to $1.13.  We are assuming an average share count of 275 million shares and a tax rate of 25%. For the full year 2014, we expect to generate free cash flow of $900 million. So in closing, we're pleased to have delivered above our earnings commitment in the first quarter despite some challenges. As we head into the seasonally important second quarter, I feel good about our positioning and our focus for the balance of the year.  And now Sue and I will be happy to take your questions, and Karen, I'll turn it over to you to moderate. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein. Steven Winoker : A couple of questions. One, I kept hearing a lot about these systems and ERP issues through the quarter that I think had pushed out expectations as well. Can you maybe give us some color on what actually happened on that front and how you had mitigated it and what the status is of its -- all -- through all that? Michael Lamach : Yes, Steve, I kind of thought, with the amount of chatter that went in print over the last several weeks, that might be first on the list. So I'll give a bit more of an expansive answer here, I think, trying to help anybody else in the queue from repeating [ph] the question. So I'll cover a fair amount of detail. We went live with Phase 2 and again, it's a 6-phase ERP implementation in mid-February. Actually, February 10 was the date that we went live. It included a large portion of our European transport business. It was a small portion of our Compressed Air Systems and Services business. And it included ordering warehouse logistics modules for our North American commercial Unitary and residential HVAC businesses. So we plan for a post go live stabilization period of about 4 to 6 weeks, which is normal when you have a system go live. And then for stock businesses, we built an inventory buffer to compensate. We expect a lower productivity during a system downtime just prior to go live and then, as people get used to the new standard work and processes going forward. And then our experience and that of all the folks we're working with would be that it takes about 6 months post-launch to achieve the expected productivity benefits from a conversion like that. So the TK and Air Systems launches went very smoothly. And the unitary conversion was much more typical productivity curve I just mentioned a second ago. So we planned an additional 10 days of inventory to be held at the Unitary warehouses, and we have that in place by the end of January. On the 29th and 30th of January, though, several plants were shut down due to the first snowstorm and ice storm that Sue alluded to. And then of course, the knockout impact to inbound, outbound logistics, as transportation carriers were all delayed in that process as well. Now what usually happens after something like that is you see a demand spike after the storm cleared, which we saw. And that's depleted a portion of the buffer that was in place. Now the second storm actually hit 2 days after the go live, which shut down a number of factories for about 4 days. And it had the same logistics and demand knock-on effects on that one as well. So by February 15, our 10-day buffer stock was largely depleted. And so we had a full core press-on for mid-February until the end of the quarter. And I can say, by quarter end, we were able to keep shipping paced with incoming order flow. And I'll further say that in April, we continue to see better productivity each week. So as of today, as for past due backlog, forecast shipped in the second quarter, it's primarily in the residential business and I would say it's about 1 week of higher backlog than we saw last year or that we would like to have at this time. But as you saw, Steve, quite a leverage, 57%, and then specifically the Trane North America businesses, which will be res and commercial, delivered 230% operating leverage in the quarter, which was phenomenal. So net-net, with all the disruptions from weather and the new systems, we delivered a really great quarter in Climate. And I just want to say again, I couldn't be any more proud of our customer service and our warehouse people and the operations, the business teams that went really the extra mile to satisfy customers during the weather disruptions and the system transition. It was a beautiful thing. We expect to hit business case productivity levels in line with what I said earlier. So that'd be in the August time frame, I think we'd be running at the business case level for productivity. Steven Winoker : Great. And then maybe a higher-level question. Nelson Peltz resigned from the board, we saw. Are you likely to fill the seat? And what kind of skill set are you thinking about? Sort of what's been lost and how are you thinking about that? Michael Lamach : Well, with Nelson coming off in June and 2 directors coming off next year, we'll go out and look at -- for a search. Ideally, we'd love to have somebody with international, large-scale P&L experience in an industrial setting. So we're out there and over the next 15 months or so, we'll be looking to add to the board around those 3 departures that are planned over the next year or 15 months, probably looking to fill 2, and have a board size of about 11. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of David Raso from the ISI Group. David Raso : On the margins for the year by segment, I'm just trying to get a feel for how you're thinking with the full year for both margins? Obviously, Climate had a great quarter, Industrial was a disappointment. Can you just update us on the thoughts for margins for each segment for the year? And then I have a question related to that for 2Q. Susan Carter : David, it's Sue. So as we think about the full year and again, we haven't changed our guidance for the full year outlook. So this is going to be pretty much information you know. Our Climate operating income margin, we expect a 40 to 80 basis points improvement over last year. And on the Industrial segment, flat to up about 20 basis points. David Raso : Okay. So on the industrial, to get back on track for that, it appears what the second quarter is implying for margins, I assume we're looking for a nice snapback in Industrial margins for the quarter, where industrial margins will be up year-over-year in 2Q? Susan Carter : Yes. So let's talk about the second quarter. So the guidance would be looking at sort of low-single digits revenue growth for the business. And an operating margin back in, perhaps, the 16% to 16.5% range. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : First, just on price and cost, Mike. You said price overcame materials cost inflation, but did you actually have net materials cost inflation? Or materials were actually grinding a little bit lower here? Susan Carter : So let me try, Jeff, and look at your question. So when we think about the first quarter, I mean, obviously, the direct material inflation is pretty tame. And perhaps there's a little noise in that as we get towards the end of the year. But if you think about in total, we saw about 50 basis points of price and then as we talked about in the call, about 40 basis points overall for price versus direct material inflation. So when we think about the price, we got positive price in both of our segments, so positive in TK, positive in Trane, commercial and res, and so we feel pretty good about that pricing. And again, direct material inflation, pretty tame in Q1, probably pretty tame through the first half and then maybe some noise around seal in the back half of the year. Jeffrey Sprague : And then my second question is on the investment spend. Should we still expect something in the neighborhood of $0.18 for the year? And it kind of appears from your commentary that all or most of that spend was in Industrial this quarter. Is that correct? Could you address both of those points? Susan Carter : Yes. So I think the full year remains about the same. And as we think about the first quarter versus the full year, yes, you would say that more of the investment spend -- it had a bigger impact on the Industrial margins in the first quarter, but again, it'll be pretty balanced as we go through the year. But the total year hasn't really changed. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So I thought the incremental margins this quarter were pretty darn good, you're north of the 25% number that we talked about last quarter despite the ERP issues, the weather issues in Climate, the Club Car disruptions. Is there a potential catch-up embedded into your 2Q guidance? And perhaps, maybe you can talk a little bit about whether your incremental margins are conservative for the remainder of the year. Susan Carter : So Joe, as we think about leverage in our terminology, obviously, the Climate businesses had very good leverage in the first quarter at 57%. And then overall, for the company, about 26% for the business. So when you think about Q2 and what that means, the guidance would sort of give you the implication that the overall leverage for the company is up around the 40% level, with just north of 30% coming out of the operating segments and then you start to get some tailwind out of the corporate expenses also. And so obviously, as we've looked at it, the second quarter, the guidance looks right to us. Again, the business is just over 30% total, just over 40% because we do start to get some of that corporate uptick. And then for the full year, obviously, where we haven't changed anything, we're still sticking with the story that we had in the upper-30s for the full year, with 25% coming out of the businesses. But in fairness, as we go through the second quarter and we come back in the month of July and talk about the total year, we'll take another look at that. Joseph Ritchie : That's helpful, Sue. And just one follow-up question on your -- it looks like you took up your free cash flow guidance to the upper end of your range. I think you had $850 million to $900 million last quarter, now you're at $900 million. It's pretty good free cash flow as the year progresses. Talk to us a little about your uses of -- that cash, specifically as it relates to buyback and M&A? Susan Carter : So we talked about what we were going to do on the share repurchase, and we said that we completed the $2 billion authorization, we're spending on the remaining Allegion money, about $175 million in the second quarter. And then we said we'd take about $400 million to $500 million of the free cash flow and apply it to share buyback in the year, and that math sort of gets you the first quarter, plus the second, the final Allegion dollars. And then the $400 million to $500 million gets you to that $1.375 billion to $1.425 billion that we talked about in the script. And so then as you think about that with the $900 million of free cash flow guidance, that's roughly about half of the free cash flow. And we said that what we would do is -- with the remainder is toggled between M&A and investments in the business and share repurchase for the remainder of the free cash flow. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Yes, I guess the first question was around the sort of mix of business within the Climate segment. If you look at the institutional phasing businesses, I think those were down slightly, the Applied business was down slightly. You talked before about Applied being flat for the year. Are you still sticking with that? And maybe just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your Applied customers in terms of quotation and order activity? Michael Lamach : Well, it's mixed globally, Julian. But I think North America tends to be the focus of the question, typically. Interestingly, when we look at bookings in the first quarter for North America Applied, they were actually up high-single digits. If you look at Unitary North America, they were actually up teens. And one thing that we probably need to identify here is there's a buy/sell component of what we do, often tied to contract and we might do a performance contract and have a pump set made by somebody else that we sell through to the end customer. That's actually the business that's down. So what we're seeing in terms of an uptick in our bookings, full resourcing of our plants, absorption of our plants, it would lend toward a decent back-half of the year, kind of recovering back up the level that we have thought. So it's actually a very good quarter in both supply and Unitary North America. I would say that the weakness is probably more around the mature economy, which we would include China and Asia Pacific. And it's just a matter of which segments of the market are going to be working there and not -- specifically in China, it's easy to identify it's going to be areas like nuclear, pharma, food and it's going to be away from some of the heavy industries like shipbuilding and so on and so forth. So we'll adjust accordingly in how we're looking at that. And then Europe has been very strong for us as well. In fact, the Applied business in Europe was up high-single digits as well. So it was a pretty good quarter for bookings, and I think we'll see that flow through for the balance of the year and obviously, for the Climate segment, we should end at a higher note. Julian Mitchell : And then in terms of the gross productivity measures, is it fair to say that those have been fairly steady the past 6 months? I guess, in Q4, you just had the costs rising up to offset that and then they fell back again in Q1. But overall, gross productivity should be fairly steady through the balance of the year, there was nothing special in Q1? Michael Lamach : Well, remember, too, that the gross productivity really hasn't changed much between Q4 and Q1 from operations. That uptick we saw was really on headquarter spending as it related to a lot of the benefit plans and in changes that had to be approved for in the fourth quarter on a strong year. So operationally, what we're tending to run with about 120% of the pipeline that we think we need productivity in a given quarter or year, and that's been a pretty good mechanism for us to make sure that we've got enough inventory to the pipeline to keep things humming. So it was a good quarter but the underlying productivity in quarter 4 was good, too. I think it was a little bit misunderstood because of the blurring of all the adjustments and accruals made outside of operations in the fourth quarter. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Just a question on the Industrial side. I'm just surprised that given all the excitement about a short-cycle industrial recovery, sort of, Industrial even x the Club Car business just sort of not doing better, can you talk about what kind of visibility we have on Industrial in mature markets in North America and Europe? Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, the visibility on Compressed Air Systems and Services is pretty good, and we've got a pretty good look there, for the most part. When you -- if you look at the quarter, about 2/3 of the leverage missed expectation would've been through Club Car. Now they did a fantastic job getting golf fleets out in the quarter. But what had to give was the ability to get some of the utility vehicles that go with that out, which will be through second quarter and third quarter of this year. The remaining 1/3 on the deleverage piece of that was heavy in terms of the investments, a question was asked earlier, and a lot of that is not just in channel and not in product but it's also in kind of putting the right level of talent into these business units : Power Tools, fluid management and Material Handling. We're seeing really good bookings, in Material Handling, as an example. We're seeing very good bookings in fluid management, a little weaker in Compressed Air. And Club Cars, we mentioned, has got low-single digit growth. So I feel like for the long-cycle businesses, which really, in our mind, are Club Car, Material Handling and the Compressed Air Systems and Services business, pretty good visibility for the year. Power Tools tends to be more of a spot buy, and fluid management tracks with a lot of what you're seeing in comparables from other companies as well. So we don't have that [ph] forward visibility, too, at this point. I feel good about the plan we've got for the balance of the year to bring margins back up over the balance of the year. Andrew Obin : And just to clarify on orders. Do you think orders were impacted by the weather? And if yes, are -- you think you're going to get them back in the second quarter? Michael Lamach : Orders, not so much. Shipments of Club Car, absolutely. But orders, not so much. And so I wouldn't think there'd be much -- more of a push there, I would suppose, that I would think about it being something more fundamental being pushed in the second quarter. We didn't have any issues in any of our factories, whether it be Climate or Industrial. I don't think we lost a minute of downtime to anything other than weather. So we were able to keep up in inventory levels, where we have stocking and tools and fluids, we're pretty good. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : I may be splitting hairs a little bit here, but I guess I'm just trying to think through this order question as well.  You put up a couple of quarters of 5% that are only kind of getting the year up 3% to 4% in terms of revenue. Is there anything that would lead you to believe things will decelerate going forward? Or is this just kind of normal conservatism? Michael Lamach : I think it's got a more of a long-cycle view as to whether or not we think things will happen in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of next year based on some of the bookings we' re seeing : very large Compressed Air Systems and Services and very large Applied HVAC orders. And that's 2 areas that, as you look through that, potentially some delays in these projects, particularly in some of the mature economies in Asia, that's a little bit hard to pinpoint exactly when we'd see those revenue for the year. So that's probably the one blind spot. I would also say that as you look at our year, 10% in the first quarter of earnings. There's a lot of runway left here for the balance of the year and for us. I'm not sure it's conservative a view so much as it is a pragmatic view that we've got a long way to go for the year. So I think July for us is just a much more useful update for you than it would be trying to pinpoint it here in April. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, I can appreciate that. And maybe if I could just ask you to comment sort of on the tenor of the quarter. Did things kind of get better into March? And any early read on April yet? Michael Lamach : March was pretty good for us. I would tell you that we had good strength. Even in the HVAC res business, January and February, just take that for a second, the Hardy sell-through, we actually matched the 5 in January and the 9 -- yes, the 5 in January and the 9 in February. March, we haven't seen yet. So we're anxious at some point to get that data as well. But where March, we're matching at least the Hardy segment there. And I think that we were happy with March's performance. I'm not going to give you much more of a read in the second quarter, it's pretty early for us, and I think I said all along, so much of the year has really delivered in the last couple of weeks of June for us. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi Research. Deane Dray : Mike, a question on the potential that ductless systems would gain more adoption in the U.S. and in Europe. So just looking in your crystal ball today, how fast might you see the take on ductless? What might the gating factors be? And does Trane have the right capacity in place to respond to this demand if it does come through? Michael Lamach : Yes. We're counting on the world being a ductless place and being a player across the world in all geographies. It's interesting that we don't hear as much about ducted solutions in other parts of the world. But our Unitary business in Asia, which is a very large business, was actually up 35% in the quarter. So we're growing that business as well. We want to have a full product suite, we want to have ductless systems, we want to have applied Unitary systems and we want to have hybrid systems where it makes sense. So it's really a matter of building a portfolio. Relative to your question about do we have the product portfolio, I'd say, yes, we do. And when we don't, we have the right partnerships. But I think we're doing the right things to put ourselves in a position to be a global player in all technologies. Deane Dray : Great. And then for Sue, I was hoping you could comment on the stranded costs from Allegion, size for us where it stands and what the horizon is for taking those costs out? Susan Carter : Okay. So the best way to think about all of that is to think about most of those stranded costs being in the corporate number. So as we talk about corporate and what we think corporate will look like, the unallocated portion of it for 2014, we expect that to be about $200 million for the year. 2013, that corporate number was $260 million. So there were about $40 million of stranded costs, which came out, and then about $20 million of other savings that we planned into 2014. So in the fourth quarter, we did our restructuring actions that, again, some of those fell over into the $0.02 that we saw in Q1. But those costs are primarily out of Ingersoll Rand. We are complete with that restructuring and the stranded costs have gone away. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Just wanted to dig into the North American Trane leverage. You called out 200% incremental margins. Now granted volumes are still pretty light there, but I'm wondering could you just talk about base cost productivity pricing? And how does that then leverage, as volumes pick up, taking the Applied business, what sort of incremental margins can you get from Trane North America? Michael Lamach : Well, in the quarter, Nigel, there was about 1 point of productivity looking at the total gross productivity less total inflation. And then from a price perspective, about 70 points fell through on price alone. So in general, they've just done a good job of consistent productivity, keep the pipeline full. There's not been a silver bullet. It's the same things we've been talking about for 4, 5 years there. And just a really excellent quarter, excellent execution. As I said, it wasn't weather-related, we didn't lose a minute in production in any of our factories. So I'm proud of that. Not sure what else I could really tell you on that one. Nigel Coe : But any deal on how that business leverage as, particularly, the commercial HVAC volumes start to pick up? Michael Lamach : Yes. I think we'll leverage at about gross margin of the business. And so I'd be looking potentially for that to be as high as 30% and as we've said, as low as 25%, which is where the guidance is. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura Securities. Shannon O'Callaghan: Mike, maybe just to follow-up on that. I mean, the 57% conversion in Climate, and I think you said 230% North America Trane. I mean, I know you're expecting good leverage going forward but I guess, what are the things that make it come down from that level? Michael Lamach : Well, it's the timing of productivity events. I mean, there were no one-offs that happened. It's somewhat on low-growth, the lost small numbers working for you in this case as well. So I just think you should kind of get into a fuller year with larger numbers and more normalized margins, incrementals going forward. You're going to tend to revert back to -- you will revert back to gross margins in the business. That's fundamentally what the view is. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, that makes sense. And then just maybe update, you're talking about potentially toggling to M&A. I mean, what are your current views of that market in terms of what's out there and how active do you think it might be? Michael Lamach : Well, we've been very selective. We did a small deal in the first quarter on an energy supply company that didn't -- we didn't make any headlines with that. But sort of looking selectively. We've got a few smaller things that are really tucked into the commercial channel for HVAC that we're looking at. But it's been and continues to be a pretty disciplined process, really nothing earth-shattering, certainly nothing transformational in the cards. But there's probably 10, I would say, active ideas we're looking at. It will be based, as Sue said, on valuation and holding a mirror up to our share price and other investments, just seeing what we think is best for the shareholder a year out. So that's our view. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from MKM Partners. Joshua Pokrzywinski : So just maybe to beat this operating leverage question to death. Looking at 2Q, it seems like a lot of that strength persists, and I know you mentioned that 1Q, some of that is just a function of good productivity on smaller absolute volume numbers. I guess that implies some decel there in the second half. Is that a comprehensive view on maybe some of that problematic steel pricing that you mentioned or load of productivity pipeline for the second half? Or is that just we don't have the visibility yet to make that call? Susan Carter : Joshua, I think one of the ways I would look at it, and Mike can add his thoughts afterwards, is we talked about where we expect the second quarter to be, and that we really haven't updated the guidance for the full year and that we would talk to you more about that in July. I think what you're seeing on that leverage and the calculation, it's just math at this point in time. I think we feel good about -- we feel very good about where Climate came out in the first quarter. We feel very good about where we're looking at both businesses, as Mike said, and roughly the gross margin territory for the second quarter. And as we get into July, we'll give you more color on what think the full year will look like. Michael Lamach : Josh, I'll probably add that looking at quarter 1 and quarter 2 for both segments, the productivity really stays the same, which is exactly what we're looking for, is that 120% pipeline drumbeat that with breakage, you get to what you thought you'd get 100%, maybe do better. That's always a good thing if you can get better. But it's really preserving our pipeline. I would say that investments would tick up, particularly in the Climate business a little bit and tie in with things like new product launches. But also, you got second quarter, the effect of all the wage increases, which, across the company, start in April 1. So you've got a little bit of a run rate change there in wage structure. So it reverts back to something like the gross margins. And that's a pretty steady drumbeat that we look to attain over time. So we're going to have great quarters like we had and we're going to have some weaker quarters in there, but 25% is a good number to plan with. 30% would be the gross margin of the business. So that's what we look to do. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Okay, that's helpful. And then just as a follow up and I think Nigel asked this question, I don't know if you addressed it directly. Any differences between Applied and Unitary? I know you've done some big product refreshes on both sides. Any differences there when we start to see that Applied business pick up, whether it's mix-positive or negative, I guess, should we expect that to behave differently when that finally comes around? Michael Lamach : Yes, with all the restructuring that's been done over the last 4 and 5 years and all the product development that's taking place, we're indifferent really as to if Unitary or Applied goes up. There's really not a change in the contribution margin business. And so the nice thing is we're, I think, we're levered either way but I wouldn't expect things would change one way or the other with the higher Applied versus Unitary mix. I mean, right now, of course, we're seeing higher Unitary than Applied but, eventually it'll cycle back around. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Maybe you can contribute and offset some of these rounds played that are down, it should be a pretty good spring for you guys, it sounds like. The incremental margin question, I guess, I just wanted to get a little more precision on this because to get to 110 in EPS using kind of a 4% to 5% growth rate, it seems like there is a little bit of a higher kind of implied incremental. What is corporate going to be in the second quarter, I guess?  And then I can kind of, I guess, back into what that implies for the segments? Susan Carter : So when you think about corporate and we're spending, it should be roughly $50 million-ish.  Again, you take the $200 million for the year and it's roughly the same throughout the quarters. Now what you will find when you're thinking about this in terms of leverage is that the quarters in 2013, the corporate costs and corporate components were actually increasing. Therefore, taking out the stranded costs and taking out some of the G&A costs will provide a bigger lift in terms of leverage as we go through each of the successive quarters and we do see that in the second quarter. C. Stephen Tusa : Sure. And then -- and I guess, just for the -- so I can kind of -- you get to kind of a baseline and you told us what the industrial margin range is going to be, what -- I'm getting something around 14% for the Climate margin in 2Q? Susan Carter : 13.5%, yes, somewhere in there. You're not far off. Michael Lamach : Yes, Steve, we've looked at 40 to 80 basis points maybe for the full year and last year, it was around 12.7%. So kind of 13.5% is probably a much better number than 14% there. The incrementals, Sue mentioned earlier in her comments, are 30 and you can say probably more precisely like 31 from the businesses. The other 10 points of lift comes from the headquarters reduction. And so there's a little better incremental margin in Q2 versus Q1. And that was planned. Of course, weather wasn't planned but the transition to the ERP System was planned. And so that didn't really change much in terms of what we had expected there. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeffrey Hammond : Just a couple of loose-end items. Can you just talk about the sustainability, the strength you're seeing in Thermo King? And then also, commercial HVAC orders down in Asia. Is that kind of bad lumpiness or is that kind of the trend you're seeing over in Asia? Michael Lamach : Well, the lumpiness really has to do with just sort of the macro economy in China, and we're dealing with that like everybody else. There are some very, very big deals in Asia that would swing that. But absent hotels, hospitals and pharma, some nuclear, there's real weakness in some of the other segments of the market. Really, actually, the weakness in industrial plays through to HVAC, where we're, if not the largest, one of the largest process cooling provider out in the marketplace. And so when semiconductor businesses go down, we feel that in the HVAC business, actually, just the same. So that's an example there. Your question on TK, and the outlook there, it was a good start to the year. Containers have run more like 5% of our total. TK mix, it was 10% in the quarter. Those are very, very lumpy in terms of how that works. And so the underlying businesses were strong in Europe. I think that that moderates and normalizes through the balance of the year. And in North America, truck and trailer is about what we thought when we called out in the year. Really no difference there, more or less flat industry volumes but revenue pickup just on the mix, with the new product being more expensive with the new car compliant. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jamie Sullivan from RBC Capital Markets. Jamie Sullivan : Mike, maybe just some of the market commentary you mentioned with the Dodge revisions. You also talked about in North America, your Applied orders were up in the quarter. But you've also been a little more cautious on the market forecast. Just wondering if you can maybe give us an update on if these trends maybe change your view on the cycle at this point? Michael Lamach : Yes, and we always look at a group of indicators. I think I say that every time we meet but I'm always cautious somebody might be new to -- that's listening to the call. One of the key areas of the Dodge put-in-place and starts data, which we triangulate with a couple of other metrics, one that we all think supports what's happening in terms of our own proposal pipeline that we can look at the same. So the latest Dodge forecast for 2014 put-in-place up about 8% versus 2013. And you've got to look at the underlying trends by verticals within that. Institutional, which is over half of the put-in-place dollars, was actually forecasted to be down 2% in its revision. And that's the sixth consecutive year of that happening. Of course, the ABI numbers were a little bit weak this morning as well. But the commercial, industrial activities forecast to be up 18%. So really, on the commercial, industrial activity, my view would be that, that will come down slightly from 18%. I don't think it'll stay there. I think they'll revise it down. When I think of the Applied market, at least what we're seeing, it might be a little bit stronger than what we're seeing there. One of the interesting things that we saw there today was that property tax receipts in the country now are at the 2008 pre-recession levels, and that's always a pretty good indicator of when institutional spending comes back, schools, K-12, health care, bond issuances, more infrastructure, I mean, those are typically -- that's the cycle we look for there. So anyway, that's sort of the mix that leaves us to kind of maybe hedging back a little bit on the Industrial and Commercial forecast, that 18%. We're probably not so sour on the Applied side. So it doesn't really change much for the year for us. Jamie Sullivan : And then just a follow-up on the resi side. Maybe you could just comment on what you're seeing on the mix of efficiency levels that you're seeing in revenues and orders? And then maybe your expectations for a pre-buy or inventory build ahead of the January cut-off for the new efficiency standards next year? Michael Lamach : Yes, things are trending toward higher efficiencies, so trending up toward 14 SEER at this point. So we're seeing the 13 SEER on mix change, that's good for us, good for the industry as well. As it relates to any sort of a pre-build, the nice thing here is that we're going to have a pretty good opportunity to look at the price gap between 14 and 13 SEER at the end of the year in the marketplace.  That's going to drive a lot of what happens in terms of the pre-build. Of course, the larger the gap, the more pre-build that you would see. The smaller the gap, the less you'd see. We'll roll up a view from all of our dealers and distributors and closer to the end of the year. The nice thing about all of that is we would be building air conditioning in our air conditioning plants in the fourth quarter, which is a very seasonally low quarter. So all of that portends to being able to take a relatively late look in the summer at that and then planning accordingly for fourth quarter based on the variables and the dynamics I just mentioned. Operator : And our final question for today comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities. Eli Lustgarten : Just a clean-up issue. You had a very impressive first quarter despite all the weather issues and postponements, stuff like that. Do you have any measure of how much production was actually pushed into the second quarter from the first quarter, particularly, it looks like in Industrial it's got to be measurable at this point? Michael Lamach : Yes, with the exception of Club Car, everything else was a push. We had higher demand for parts and services and lower demand for a few Industrial products but generally a push. But Club Car was the big outlier there for us. From a production standpoint, nothing else really pushed. From a distribution standpoint, I mentioned earlier, we've got about 1 week more in backlog than we'd like to have in the residential business that can ship on orders, and we'll be fleshing that out over the next week or 2. Eli Lustgarten : Right. And could we get some quantification, is that like $20 million or $30 million worth of production that we're going to see and catch up in the second quarter? It sure do looks like it's something to that effect. Michael Lamach : Well, it's -- if I looked at the res piece of that, you're probably not too far off. The Club Car piece, second, third quarter, that will kind of kick in there as well. I would say that you're probably in the ballpark on that. That's for the quarter. I've kind of taken the second quarter up, and 4% to 5% reflects that we'll see a little bit of that, whether it's 25 to maybe 40 in total. But some of that. Eli Lustgarten : And finally, your restructuring, I guess, is implying $0.07 in the second half of the year with a bigger -- is there any change causing the back half order has always been that way and does it say anything about 2015 restructuring since your numbers are stronger in the second half of the year than the first half? Michael Lamach : We've been doing a lot of restructuring for a long time. I think that what you've got here is where that maintenance fees, the $0.10, which has been typically what it's run for us. And so the $0.03 being spent in the first half leaves $0.07 for the back half. That's, again, one of those things, Eli, that in July, I think we'd have a better view, a clearer view of any projects we want to undertake in the third and fourth quarter and update you there. But for now, that placeholder, I think, stands and it's a good number to rely on. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any concluding comments. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, Karen. We don't have any further comments. Joe and I will be around for follow-ups today. Everybody, have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to Janet Pfeffer, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasury. Please go ahead. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the call. We released earnings this morning at 7 :00 a.m., and the release is posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting, in addition to this phone call, through our website at ingersollrand.com, where you will find the slide presentation that we'll be using this morning. This call will be recorded and archived on our website.  If you'd please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated. This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables to our news release. Now let me introduce the participants in this morning' s call : Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations.  With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Great. Thanks, Janet, and good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. In the second quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.13. There was a small amount of restructuring in the quarter, less than $0.01, but this quarter's reported and adjusted EPS are identical. That's at to the top end of our adjusted earnings guidance range and a 22% increase versus the second quarter of 2013. Revenues were $3.5 billion, up 4.3% versus last year. Revenues were consistent with our guided revenue range of up 4% to 5% for the quarter.  Orders were up 5% in the second quarter, with Climate up 6% and Industrial up 2%. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring from the prior year, was up 150 basis points. Climate margins increased 150 basis points. Industrial margins were up 30 basis points. Pricing exceeded direct material inflation, as it has each quarter for more than 3 years. Operating leverage was about 50%, with 43% leverage at the segment. We repurchased 4 million shares in the second quarter. Overall, a very good quarter with revenues about where we thought they would be, an excellent operating leverage on the revenue growth, particularly in the HVAC businesses, both residential and commercial.  Now Sue will walk you through more details in the second quarter. I'll then take you through our third quarter and 2014 outlook. Susan Carter : Thanks, Mike. Starting at a high level, our bookings for the quarter were up 5%. Revenues were up 4%, and our operating margins, without restructuring, were up 150 basis points year-over-year. Reported earnings per share were $1.13 versus midpoint guidance of $1.10. We were a little better on price and mix and $0.01 lower in restructuring. Let's move to Slide 4. Orders for the second quarter of 2014 were up 5% on a reported basis, and excluding currency. Climate orders were up 6%. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up low-single digits. Transport orders were up mid-teen. Orders in the Industrial segment were up 2% on both a reported basis and excluding currency. Let's go to Slide 5. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and by region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, second quarter revenues were up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and excluding currency. Climate revenues increased 4%, with commercial HVAC revenues up low-single digits and transport revenues up high-single digits. Residential HVAC revenues were up high-single digits. Industrial revenues were up 4% on a reported basis and excluding currency. I'll give more color on each segment in the next few slides.  On the bottom of the chart, which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 3% in the Americas, 16% in EMEIA, and Asia was down 2%, all excluding foreign exchange. The lower revenue in Asia was mainly driven by geographies outside of China. China was about flat, excluding currency.  Now let's go to Slide 6. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from second quarter 2013 of 11.4% to second quarter of 2014, which was 13.1%, an increase of 170 basis points. This chart is on a reported basis. We've clearly spiked out the impact of restructuring costs for you, which was 20 basis points of tailwind year-over-year. Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were 60 basis points positive versus prior year. Our pricing programs continue to outpace material inflation, adding 50 basis points to margin. As Mike said, we've been consistently positive on this measure for more than 3 years.  Productivity versus other inflation was a full margin point positive impact in the quarter. Productivity ramped up in the quarter as we got past all the weather-related impacts of the first quarter and saw benefit from the restructuring done in late 2013 and earlier this year. Year-over-year investments in restructuring were higher by 40 basis points in total. In the box, you can see that, that was comprised of 60 basis points of headwind from investments, mainly in IT, channel expansion and new product investments, and there was a 20-basis-point benefit from lower restructuring costs. So if you prefer to look at this on an adjusted basis, adjusted margins increased a net of 150 basis points versus the 170 basis points on a reported basis.  Leverage in the quarter was excellent at almost 50%, excluding restructuring from last year, and 43% in the segment. Climate's leverage at 48% was led by the HVAC businesses, particularly in North America. Let's go to Slide 7. The Climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the second quarter were $2.7 billion. That is up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up low-single digits. Orders were up in the Americas, Europe and Asia.  Commercial HVAC revenues were up low-single digits. Revenues were up high-single digits in Europe, up low-single digits in the Americas and down in Asia. Commercial HVAC new equipment revenues were down slightly, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were up mid-single digits versus prior year.  Growth in worldwide unitary equipment revenues was more than offset by lower applied revenues. Thermo King orders were up mid-teens versus 2014 second quarter, led by increases in truck, trailer and bus. Container orders were slightly lower in the quarter. Thermo King revenues were up high-single digits with truck and trailer revenue up low-single digits and marine container revenues up significantly. Residential HVAC revenues were up high-single digits versus last year. Unit volumes were also up high-single digits, and mix was positive in the quarter. The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 14.2% in the quarter, 150 basis points higher than the second quarter of 2013 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Now let's go to Slide 8. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $794 million, up 4% from last year's second quarter. For the Industrial segment, excluding Club Car, revenues were up mid-single digits, and orders were also up mid-single digits versus last year. Excluding Club Car, revenues in the Americas and Asia Pacific were up, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were up over 20%, part of which was positive currency impact. Revenues in the air compressor business were up mid-single digits, with strong gains in oil-free products and parts and services.  Club Car revenues in the quarter were down low-single digits, while orders were down mid-single digits versus prior year, as both markets were down in the quarter. Industrial's operating margin of 16.4% was up 30 basis points on higher volume, productivity and pricing, partially offset by inflation and investment spending.  Let's go to Slide 9. Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4% of revenue in the quarter. The increase versus prior year is from higher receivables and inventory, partially offset by higher payables balances. Days sales outstanding is up mainly due to mix of business. Delinquency is unchanged from prior year. On inventory, we have been intentionally increasing stocked inventory levels of key assemblies in order to ensure supply, particularly in the higher selling season.  Year-to-date, June free cash flow was $98 million. Working capital will come down in the second half to a level closer to 3% of revenues based mainly on timing of revenues. May and June are our highest 2 months sales volume, and given our DSO is about 60 days. That drove higher working capital balance at the end of the second quarter.  And let's go to Slide 10. We repurchased 4 million shares for approximately $200 million in the second quarter. Year-to-date June, we have spent $1 billion in share repurchases and repurchased about 17 million shares. Our forecast for the year remains to spend between $1.375 billion and $1.475 billion on repurchase, with $400 million to $500 million of that coming from free cash flow.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike. Michael Lamach : Great. Thank you, Sue, and please go to Slide 11. Before we review the forecast, I want to take a few minutes to mention some very important new products the Trane commercial introduced in Europe at the end of June.  This is a milestone for Trane since we're introducing 5 new chiller products at the same time. Products included centrifugal, air-cooled and screw chiller designs and cover a broad range of sizes and market applications, including education, healthcare, lodging, large commercial buildings and process cooling in Europe. All these new systems are available with advanced controls and designed for cost effectiveness and optimal energy efficiency for both full load and part-load performance.  The chiller in the upper right side of the slide, the Series E CenTraVac, is truly a breakthrough technology. These products are designed for cooling large commercial buildings and are up to 10% more energy-efficient for the next best chiller available in this tonnage range. The true innovation is that the E Series is the first commercialized chiller to use an ultra-low global warming potential HFO refrigerant. The new refrigerant allows the E Series chillers to continue to utilize Trane's highly reliable and efficient direct rise of low pressure designs that have made Trane chillers the global leader in centrifugal chillers.  I believe we are gaining momentum in our capabilities to introduce new products in all of our businesses. This will help to improve our growth rates as we see the slow recovery of our commercial construction and markets we're in. Now let's move to the forecast, and please go to Slide 12. In the aggregate, markets were about where we thought they would be, some a little better and some a little weaker. Our second quarter revenues were in line with our guidance. Dodge put in place forecast for 2014, did not change much in the latest update. In total, the 2014 Dodge forecast is still up about 8%. Relate this to our North American business, commercial and industrial buildings tend to use more Unitary equipment, while the institutional markets use more Applied equipment.  The commercial and industrial forecast was unchanged at up 18% versus 2013, while the institutional forecast still is forecasted to be down 1% for the year. Within commercial and industrial, the vertical with the largest growth is still warehouses at over 30%. They have little HVAC content.  The verticals for Trane, our office and bank, retail and manufacturing, which are all up, but at a more modest rate. Within institutional, government is expected to be down over 20%, while education and healthcare are forecast to be slightly down in 2014.  The only vertical in institutional forecasted to be up in 2014 is amusement, was not a key vertical for Trane. We expect Europe, Middle East and Africa to be up mid-single digits for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be up low-single digits overall, with China up low to mid-single digits. The remainder of the region will be fairly flat. We've seen impact, for example, in Thailand with the political unrest there. The full year outlook for residential HVAC markets is still for mid to high-single digit growth in the Unitary volumes, industry volumes. Transport markets had a good start to the year, particularly in Europe and in marine. Bookings growth has been front-end loaded for both trailer and container. We expect booking rates to moderate in the second half. We expect the full year North American trailer market to be flat, slightly up on a unit basis, but up high-single digits on a dollar basis due to the mix of CARB-compliant product.  Industrial markets were somewhat improved in the quarter. The latter half of the quarter showed some recovery in China. Based on the first half results of our outlook for the second half, we are raising our full year revenue. We see revenues up about 4% from the prior guidance of about 3% to 4%. Actually, not much changed in the aggregate to our Climate revenue outlook. The change was in Industrial, where we are raising revenue expectation. Our updated forecast is for Industrial to be up 2% to 3% versus the prior forecast of flat to up 2%. The increased outlook was in our core industrial businesses, as gulf markets are expected to be flat, down for the year. Please go to Slide 13. The third quarter guidance refers to the middle column on this chart, although we've included quarter 4 on the chart just to save you some math. Third quarter 2014 revenues are forecast to be up approximately 4%. We expect growth will be stronger in Climate than in Industrial, but both should be in the low to mid-single-digit range.  Third quarter GAAP continuing earnings per share are forecast to be in the range of $1 to $1.04. Restructuring costs are expected to be about $0.01 in the quarter. So on an adjusted basis, the EPS range is $1.01 to $1.05 The current situation in Venezuela is evolving. We are continuing to evaluate the impacts that have included about $10 million or about $0.03 per share, foreign exchange losses related to Venezuelan currency in the third quarter forecast. We're assuming an average share count of 273 million shares, a tax rate of 25%. There's an EPS bridge versus last year's third quarter in the Appendix  for your reference.  For the full year, as I said, we see revenue growth of about 4%. We are raising our full year 2014 earnings outlook to a range of $3.13 to $3.21 on a reported basis. Prior comparable range was $2.95 to $3.10, which included $0.10 of restructure. For the full year, we now expect to spend about a $0.05 in restructuring. So $0.05 of the change in guidance and some change in restructuring outlook, and recall the $0.03 foreign exchange that we have in for Venezuela in Q3 guidance, which flows through to the full year. The core earnings forecast was going up by about $0.13 at the midpoint. There's no change for the full year average share count guidance of 275 million shares, with a tax rate of 25%.  So in closing, we're pleased to have delivered above our earnings commitment in the second quarter, with excellent performance in the segments. I continue to feel good about our positioning and our focus as we head in the latter half of the year. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : I just had a quick question on the margin guidance by segment for this year. You've obviously updated the revenue assumptions. You talked about Climate before, up about 40 to 80 bps, Industrial flat to up 20. How do those look now to you? Susan Carter : So Julian, when we look at those, we're leaving the Industrial segment at flat to up 20 basis points, and then on Climate, as you pointed out, we were at 40 to 80 basis points. And it now looks like about 80 to 110 basis points. So we did take that up with the guidance increase. Julian Mitchell : And then just within the margin bridge sort of in aggregate, the productivity number was very good in Q2. Do you see that as kind of a good sort of ongoing rate balance of this year and when you look out into sort of '15 and '16? Just because I think you're only halfway covered on the value streams of the cost base and so on. Michael Lamach : Julian, the thing that is important there is the pipeline that we measure. And as I've said in the past, we try to keep that pipeline between 110% and 150% of what's required, understanding that there's timing issues and some things don't work that were planned. So the health of the pipeline, it looks like it's still intact, both from a materials perspective, as well as a direct and indirect labor perspective. So I would say that we're not forecasting any real changes in productivity. However, that's always subject to the pipeline and the timing of when projects actually hit. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Andrew Obin : So very pleasantly surprised on industrial growth revision. Can you give us a little bit more detail as to what's really happening by region in North America, Europe? Michael Lamach : Well, the core industrial markets, which is non-Gulf, are doing better than we anticipated. Europe clearly is better than we anticipated across the board. As we mentioned, we're up 20% in EMEIA in the quarter, and the order book there looks great. North America, a little bit stronger, but again, stronger parts and services as well. China, which showed a little bit more strength in the latter 2 months of the prior quarter, has a decent outlook for the balance of the year in terms of the pipeline. But there, frankly, Andrew, it's large equipment orders typically that become more of a timing issue as to whether it's fourth quarter or first quarter of next year. But all in all, we felt that the core industrial businesses deserve a little bit of a fresh look. Andrew Obin : And then just a follow-up, how sustainable is the EMEIA's strength? And what's driving the strength? Is it market share gain or any particular markets? Because that looked very strong. Michael Lamach : Yes, it's actually mostly in Western Europe as well, too. So it's a combination of another thing, Andrew. I wouldn't just pick one, but clearly, we've done well with the efforts of the fast feet-on-the-street in the region. We've got, I think, great product at a good price point in the region. I think that oil-free has been a significant gainer for us there as well and for that matter, across the globe. So no, I don't think that 20% growth rates are something to plan on in Europe going forward, but we're pleasantly surprised to see that we have a great quarter there. Susan Carter : And Andrew, let me just add one thing on there. For 2014, we're expecting revenues in EMEIA to kind of be mid to high-single digits for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : It's a good quarter. It seems like pricing clearly has been strong for quite some time, but may have surprised to the upside this quarter. Europe was good, but you didn't really take up your growth expectations significantly. It seemed like a lot of the guidance raise was driven by the margins, particularly on the Climate side. And so I guess, just what gives you the confidence at this point in raising the guidance for the back half of the year? Susan Carter : So Joe, as we think about the guidance and what we're seeing in the markets and our performance, we're obviously pleased with what we've seen through 6 months, and what we've seen actually gives us some confidence for the year. As you pointed out, we're still in a low-to-moderate growth environment. And so as we looked at the revenue, the outlook is only a little bit higher, and most of the earnings guidance is from higher operating performance. The enterprise leverage is in the mid-40s, and the segment leverage is in the mid-30s for the revised guidance. And again, as we looked across at the businesses, the performance that we have, what we see on pricing versus material inflation, productivity, et cetera, we thought this was the right place to land. Joseph Ritchie : Okay, that's helpful. I guess, one follow-up on the cadence for 3Q and 4Q, particularly as it relates to the incremental margins. It seems like there's a step-down implied in your guidance for the incremental margins for 3Q and then a step back up in 4Q. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that the right way. And if so, what's causing that in 3Q versus 4Q? Susan Carter : Well, I think as you look across the quarters, I mean, I think we're still seeing in the third quarter that prices is going to offset direct material inflation, but at a lower rate, also the same for the fourth quarter in terms of the overall businesses. And then one of the other things that you see in terms of that leverage is the amount of corporate expenses that are in the fourth quarter. Michael Lamach : That corporate last year, as we were really truing up half the spend, there were some stock-based comps, benefits, changes that came in, and really in the fourth quarter, higher than the normal run rate. So there's a pickup there in the fourth quarter. We also had a flood in China in our industrial businesses, which hopefully won't repeat again this year. So that would be another reason why the fourth quarter leverages look so much higher than the normal. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond : Just wanted to kind of focus on the Applied market, and I think you said the Dodge data is still being pretty choppy, but I'm just wondering what you're seeing in the quoting activity? Any signs of inflection or kind of building momentum into '15? And then within that, if you could just kind of update us on your VRF strategy relationship with Samsung and how you think VRF competes or doesn't compete with the chiller-based systems? Michael Lamach : Well, there's a lot there Jeff, as always. So when you look at the Applied markets in general, the market in quarter one, this is the North American market, which is where the data's most available, was down about 3%. Last year, it was down 4% in total to market. Second quarter was down a little bit lower. The market was down 4%, but the market expectation, the third-party prognosticators here think that it will come back to 0 for the full year, which implies a pretty sizable third and fourth quarter pickup. Conversely, in Unitary, the market last year was about 5%. First quarter was strong at 7%. Second quarter was actually 5% again, and the prognosticators would call that down to 4%. I think it's more likely that you're not going to see -- you're going to see a ramp-up and an improvement in Applied market in the back half of the year, probably not to the extent that it's being prognosticated. And then I think on the Unitary side, those are very strong. If you even take the first 2 quarters for us, our bookings in Unitary were up double digits for the first 2 quarters. And the momentum there certainly will slow, but not to the extent to bring it down to where the market is stalling it. So I think that you'll see more gradual turning of Unitary and Applied as we go forward. Now specific to VRF, remember, our strategy is multifold. We produce some VRF in our other factories. We have an arrangement with Samsung, as well as 2 other VRF manufacturers that we utilize for components. So all in, our Unitary business is doing well across the world, which includes VRF. And of course, our RVF growth rates are growing much faster than the industry VRF growth rates because of the fact that we're working off smaller numbers there. But just as the ductless growth rates are increasing, so too is the ducted component globally for us. So from a Unitary perspective, we've had really good growth across the world in Unitary through the first 2 quarters, both in ducted and ductless. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, great. And then just, I don't know if I missed this, can you give us an update on what think corporate is, and just maybe what the run rate is exiting '14? And is that kind of how to think about the go-forward run rate? Susan Carter : So Jeff, what we've talked about for corporate spending was a range of around $200 million for the year. What we're targeting about today and what we're thinking about is a range of around $200 million to $220 million depending on how some of the things that Mike referenced earlier like the stock-based comp, the benefit plan true-ups and investment spending comes in for the year, but -- so that gives you sort of a $50 million to $55 million a quarter range for corporate expenses. But as we look at that, and I talked about $200 million to perhaps $220 million, I want to be clear that the restructuring spend and the stranded cost that were taken off from the Allegion spin, were taken out in late 2013 and early 2014. If the number was above the $200 million range, it would be because we had decided to do more investments or we had items, again, in stock-based comp or in benefit plan true-ups. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : I'm wondering if we're getting any better visibility into the next iteration of SEER requirements here in the states and how that might impact your business, whether we might see some pre-buy or perhaps that's not an issue? Just any update on that. Michael Lamach : Well, I think to your point, it's probably gotten more murky as opposed to less -- more clear. The standards really, at this point in time, as you probably are aware, are a bit up in the air again. We've got activity happening in the next couple of quarters, where DOE will lead some panels to go through the enforcement of changes to SEER standards in 2015. But those really won't become rules sometime in 2015, so it's very difficult to tell what the impact would be. I would say probably what you won't see is a quarter or 2 ago, the thought was that those rules would be in place, you might see some last-minute manufacturing of 13 SEER systems. And I think that, that probably will not be the case, because I believe that you'll probably see 13 SEER systems manufactured and sold throughout the country sometime into or through 2015. That's a bit more speculation on my part. Stephen Volkmann : Okay, great. And then can you just comment on where you think inventory channel -- channel inventory is? And whether it might need to be adjusted going forward? Michael Lamach : Are you talking about residential HVAC or what part of the business? Assuming you're on mute at this point, I'll try, so I'm going to assume that's residential HVAC. And they're at about normal levels at this point in time. We're running higher bookings in the first quarter, shipped a lot of those bookings in the second quarter and towards fairly low at the beginning of the second quarter. So fairly normalized levels for us, which tends to be a little bit lower than some of what our industry competitors hold. And if you go back over a long period of time, largely, we've been trying to do a better job on cycle times from the factory to the dealer to allow distribution to actually hold less inventory at different times during the year. So to answer your question, in short form, fairly normalized. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Andy Casey from Wells Fargo Securities. Andrew Casey : Just a couple of follow-ups, a lot's been asked. Within the industrial order improvement asking, I think it was Andrew's question, a little bit different, are you seeing any specific pockets of strength like type of customer as opposed to region? Michael Lamach : Well, yes, you do see some. I mean even in China, as you look through it, as an example, you wouldn't see strength in areas like some of the heavy metals businesses in China. But you -- so you would see some in some of the verticals that we would play more into. So of course, food and beverage and nuclear would be a big market right now in China, where we're doing well. It's those markets, but staying away from a lot of the sort of heavy industry, overcapacitized places that China has outlined would be an example. In the U.S., it's a bit broader-based than that. And then from a technology perspective, certainly, as we said, oil-free parts and services are stronger. And frankly, the parts and services piece of that is consistent with some of the investments that were made early in the year, around putting some additional feet on the street, both in terms of selling capability, but also in terms of technical service, ranks and pulling some pockets to get there. Andrew Casey : Okay, great, Mike. And then -- and returning to a prior question, again, that I think last quarter, you called out some improvement in the Applied unit order growth within the Climate orders. Did you see that continue? I know what you said about the industry forecast, but I'm just wondering within your orders, did you see that continue? Michael Lamach : Yes, we have, and we actually have what we believe is a much more reliable proprietary view of that, which is a pipeline view, which goes all the way from an early conversation with a customer or the identification of a project all the way through to following it through a pipeline with a percentage estimate of close and so on and so forth. And so you do see a larger pipeline going through. But again, I don't see that there is sort of an immediate inflection point in Applied that some of the third-party market data points would suggest, I think, some more gradual improvement through 2015 with a more gradual moderating in the Unitary business in 2015 as well. But yes, we're seeing that as well. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Could we just get a little bit more granular, first, on kind of the price side, Mike? Is there any real distinction where you're seeing it, I would guess resi versus kind of Unitary and Applied? But can you just put some perspective around what's going on in pricing in general? Susan Carter : So I suggest let me give a broad overview on pricing and what we're seeing. So from the perspective of being overall, we still expect the pricing environment to be fairly modest in 2014. So about 50 basis points of price. We still expect to be able to more than offset material inflation. But we think towards the back half of the year, as I said earlier, that the positive gap will look more like what we saw at the end of 2013, which is more in the 20 to 30-basis-point ranges as opposed to the 50-basis-point range that we're seeing. And I think that across the segment, we are seeing favorability and -- but to your point, resi was a little bit -- was part of the stronger piece of the price. Michael Lamach : Jeff, actually, we had across-the-board. So if you took Climate, both a resi and commercial, and then split up commercial by region, by product, we actually had positive price in all areas that -- as we did in industrial falls. So there weren't any big gaps you just alluded to. One of the bigger surprises was that residential was actually a price leader for us in the quarter. Jeffrey Sprague : All right. And then, Mike, could you just address kind of the comment or perhaps, Sue, on kind of inventory running higher to meet demand? It sounds a little counter to what we've been hearing on better flow through the factory and better reaction times and the like. Are you hitting some diminishing returns there or is there something in particular in the outlook that you're trying to prepare for? Michael Lamach : Well, it's a very inexpensive insurance policy right now with working capital rates where they are in the company and areas where we've got long lead items. A great example might be diesel engines for TK would be a perfect example of that, with a really strong bookings backlog. And although we expect it to moderate, we really don't want to run out of engines, which can take 12 weeks to come across the water to get here. That would just be an example of that. So -- and then selective throughout the business. But if you'd go to our tools business, there's 25 tools that we just absolutely will not stock out of. And there's been a great activity in that business, particularly around some of the new product launches with our electronic power or electric Power Tools that actually have interfaces, electronic interface, then to customer production systems. That's been a big winner for us. That's not something we're going to stock out of. And so, again, it's really building in advance. There's also campaigns that we're running in certain areas of product growth team are spearheading. So we talked about the 6 product growth team within areas where they've got to deliver a plan to spearhead something into a particular vertical market or a particular region. We're making sure that the buy up [ph] order plan's consistent with what they're trying to do. So in other words, we're trusting that those product growth teams are going to be able to action out what it is we're trying to do. Worst thing we want to do is have them do that, not be able to support with product. So it's selective, not across the board. It's got nothing to do with the value stream. It's got to do with where there are pockets of growth and whether the unique opportunity is being able to take advantage of that and certainly in really long leads, 12 to 16-week items that come in from suppliers, we want to make sure that we're not running out of those. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Raso from the ISI Group. David Raso : X the corporate expense year-over-year, the incremental margins that you're targeting around 30%, 31%, can you give us some puts and takes to how to think about the incremental margin moving forward just trying to look out to '15, just thinking about further productivity improvements? I was happy to see the compressor business, which is usually better incrementals, starting to show some life. Then they also -- maybe Thermo King in North America starting to run up against some tough comps. So I just, maybe just big picture, get your thoughts on how we should think about the segment incremental margins moving forward? Michael Lamach : Yes, David, for 5 years, we've been running somewhere in this 40% to 50% incremental margin range. I haven't calculated it lately, but I don't think we rode it as much in the last year, so. And at some point in time, logic prevails that you're going to be normalizing back toward something that looks like gross margins of the company. Of course, we're trying to drive gross margins of the company up, and worse, without having higher incrementals. But any time we do above 30% we're truly digging in beyond variable cost. We're digging into the fixed cost base of the company. So we guided initially to 25% allowing for some breakage in the business, and pipelines that may not materialize. The first 2 quarters, the pipelines did materialize, and we were able to take advantage of the opportunity to manage away the risks. But that's not always the case, and that's why I caution you and the listeners on the call that a good number tends to be the gross margin of the company. And really, the safer number is the gross margin of the company less the breakage that normally is involved in these sorts of things. David Raso : Just trying to think a little bit. You have the lower share count exiting the year than your average share count. When it comes to things like the tax rate for next year, still think of it as 25% is a good base case? Michael Lamach : Actually, I'll pass it to Sue because I was talking specifically about segment operating leverage. So... David Raso : Sure. No, I still -- I was as well. I was just trying to think of the other puts and takes. Michael Lamach : Okay. Susan Carter : Right. So David, as I think about share count and I think about tax rates, as we're looking at the -- I'll give you the example, for the second quarter, we got about a $0.10 benefit coming out of the share count and a headwind out of the tax rate of about $0.15. And for the full year, you're going to have the same story of -- you're going to have more of a headwind coming off of tax than the benefit from shares. So as I look to what happens next, I mean, obviously, we need to go through and do our operating plan. We need to look at the areas where our income is going to come from in '15 and beyond. But I think from an overall basis, there isn't a reason to think that it would be a lot different than sort of the mid-20s type of range, which is sort of where we've been at for a while. So again, in '14, you're going to have less benefit from shares than the headwind on taxes at around 25% for the year. David Raso : And then that same spirit, thinking about the repo for next year, just again, I know it's only July, but framework, this year, roughly $1.4 billion. I mean, just trying to think of a normal framework for '15, just given your cash flow and balance sheet. I mean, is the $800 million, $900 million kind of number the right way to think about it, just framework for continuing repo going forward? Susan Carter : I think as we think about it, I would say let's hold onto so much about 2015. And so we got, later in the year, see more of the activity and continue to evaluate where we are. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Could you comment on M&A, Mike, and consolidation? We've talked about it a lot in the past. What's your current thinking on that and where we are at this point in time? Michael Lamach : Yes, well, I mean, we always have the mirror we hold up, which is share buyback. And you can do something that's more accretive on EPS, margin or ROIC. We'd probably do it if it fit right into a core business, meaning that it's new technology in a related business that we can use our existing distribution to do. Or vice versa, we might have a gap in distribution, and any distribution actually do more of what we can do today. So -- but frankly, if we found those things we would do and do them, Steve. And I think that the key there is being selective, as we have been and not paying ahead of your synergies. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then just to follow up your answer to the other question on incrementals and fixed cost reduction, it looks like your restructuring opportunity ebbs and flows here, but given how much of the cost base you still have to address on the Lean side as well, I mean, can you describe this sort of longer term restructuring runway that's left inside the existing portfolio? Michael Lamach : Okay. As it relates to factory utilization, which I think is a bit where you're going with Lean, you can think about the fact that we've taken so much, that physical footprint out, which has given us that 40%, 50% operating leverage over these past 5 years. We feel pretty good about the factory footprint at this point in time. And although there's always a thing or 2 we might consider doing, it's not like we're doing any wholesale changes to that, where we're very well utilized across the business. And so Lean at this point in time is more about making sure that as we see business pick back up, we have the capacity, we have the ability to handle more throughput due to the same fixed cost base. And that, again, will help ensure that we're getting operating leverage and at least equal to the gross margins of the business, which will be the plan. That's how I would think about it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Just on HVAC first, what percentage of your sale this year do you think are going to be 14 SEER and above? And using kind of a rule of thumb is, I don't know, 15% to 20% higher price to 14 vs 13 SEER, is that fair? And then just on HVAC, the commercial stuff you talked about, the Applied markets, it doesn't sound like anything in Climate is going to get worse in the second half. It actually sounds like maybe things could get a little bit better, but you have a consistent growth rate there. Maybe just talk about that dynamic as well? Michael Lamach : Yes, Steve, the first part of your question, 14 versus 13 SEER, the industry sort of prices somewhere between 19% and 21% difference between 14 and 13 with the expectation, I think, that when 13's gone, you'd find probably more cost reduction on 14, and therefore probably a lower differential from what was 13 to what would then be 14. I don't have a breakdown in front of me, Steve, on 14 through. We've had a nice share gain there, so it plays to our strong suit because we are seeing a mix-up of particularly, as you're looking at '16 and above, we're seeing a nice action there for us. And then to your point, we're mildly optimistic. I mean our forecast for Applied, Unitary or commercial HVAC, in general, would tell you that we expect a stronger back half than first half. And so it's marginally stout, but it's a better second half than our first half. And that's, again, going back to this point, that the market prognosticators show that happening. We see that happening, albeit we think at not the various steep inflection points that are more forecast out through the industry data. C. Stephen Tusa : And any way to quantify that pipeline comment you made, whether it's bidding activity? Or I mean, any numbers or high-level numbers to quantify that, and help us understand how -- because I think JCI made the same comments about how optimistic they were maybe carried this morning as well in North America, but it's kind of hard to -- for us to get our hands around it. And any kind of high-level data around that pipeline? Michael Lamach : Yes, Steve, actually, interesting for us is there's 2 things going on. One is the pipeline improving, but there's a second activity here, it's making that a little bit difficult to give you an exact answer, which is that in most of our Climate businesses, there's a market coverage initiative underway, which is looking to make sure that whether it's by ZIP code or by country or by region or places we get our hands on it, what's our coverage ratio of the market? How many projects are we finding? What's the density of our revenue per available square foot of HVAC content? And what that's doing is driving investments into these markets, additional salespeople for market coverage. So you've got a combination of market coverage and improved pipeline giving you a larger number than I think what's actually going to be reported by some of our competitors, but I don't want to give you a wild number on that. A year from now, I think we're a bit more normalized there. That'd be a number that I hope we could hope to report to you a bit more would be a leading indicator on pipeline. But I would not be comfortable to throw out a big number at you today. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from Citi. Deane Dray : Mike, if we could stay in that the residential mix topic? We did a survey earlier this quarter, shows a pretty interesting demand characteristics, clustered demand, both at the very low end, the 13 SEER, but also a lot of interest at the high end, and you just mentioned at the 16 SEER and above. So how are you positioning the portfolio today as towards that higher end? You have all of the SEER levels represented. And how do you expect that demand for both the highest and the lowest then to play out? Michael Lamach : Yes, Dean, it's mixing up, which is good always for Trane and for American Standard's, it's good for us. Our strategy has always been to make sure that we're shoring up sort of the 13 and 14, which I kind of see as one bucket, and then really however you play 15. But 16 and above would be the higher efficiency systems that always has been a strength, continues to be a strength, both in the dealer base, but also in the product portfolio. So the key there is we want to continue to have that historical Trane strength, American Standard strength in the highest resistance. But we're making a lot of progress in the 13, 14 as well. And so it's really playing both. Deane Dray : That's helpful. And in showing us these 5 new chiller products, it begs the question, what type of growth investment have these chillers? And just broadly in terms of new product introductions, what type of growth investment is this involved? And where do you stand on your product vitality? Michael Lamach : Yes, that set of investments there would be somewhere north of $100 million, just what you're seeing on that page there. That's been part of what we've been talking about for 4 or 5 years. We started on an ECTV project, I think, when I was still running Trane commercial 2009. So yes, it takes 4, 5 years to do something like that. Now they come out much faster than that, which is a good sign. But vitality is good. I mean, the vitality for the Trane Applied portfolio were really -- kind of be off the charts in the next 5 years. It won't make any sense. It won't be meaningful. It'll be almost a complete transition of the product portfolio. Unitary, we've been at that and kind of cycling through. So it's a more normalized, kind of 20% to 30% number that we see there. But Applied will be 50% to 100%, probably, over the next, say, 3 to 5 years. Operator : And we have time for one more question today. Our final question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : So I just wanted to switch to acquisitions. You addressed that question a little bit earlier. But there's obviously been some time since you did an M&A deal and the -- obviously, the bias is still towards buybacks. But are you actively pursuing acquisition opportunities, bolt-on opportunities at this point? And if you are, what do you see in terms of pricing opportunities? Michael Lamach : Yes, Nigel, I -- same old broken record with me. I can tell you it's well over 100 things we've looked at and the 5 years since I've been here at this job. And I think it's been 3 years, maybe 5 tops, that we've had a real interest in for various reasons. So it's not as if we haven't been looking and exercising that muscle all of the time. It's just for the longest time, certainly was not as good as the share buyback was, and we've made the right decisions there. So as we look to the future, we're going to continue to hold up that mirror and understand which is more accretive and over what period of time. That's the same old answer on that one. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then just switching back quickly to Industrial, the air business. I know we've kind of had a few questions around that already, but just approaching it from a different perspective. You're clearly outperforming with Copco and I'm wondering, you mentioned share gains in air-free, particularly in Europe, but -- sorry oil-free. But if you look at it, smaller systems versus larger systems, do you think that this performance is primarily a mix shift issue or do you sense a gain in share in both smaller and larger systems? Michael Lamach : Well, it comes back to basics. It's feet on the street in the right places. It's been a constant drumbeat on the portfolio innovation there unchanged. If that continues, it's the similar story as our applied HVAC business in terms of what that roadmap looks like or the product portfolio going forward. And when we launched those products, we, in fact, launched them with features that are superior to competition, at margins that are superior to what the replacement product was. So it's a double effect when we launch product that we should have margin expansion and growth, and that's kind of what we're seeing there. But there's not -- there's no magic there. It's been -- that group's been hard at it for 5 years like the Trane team has. They had an earlier market recovery than HVAC did, and of course had much more sporty incremental margins for the first 3 or so years of that. And hopefully, that's what we'll see in the HVAC business going forward. Operator : And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back for any closing comments. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, Karen. Thank you, everyone. Joe and I will be around for any follow-up that anyone has. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.",

Now to introduce the participants on this morning' s call : Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations. With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Great. Thanks, Janet. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we delivered earnings per share of $1.10. There was a small amount of restructuring in the quarter. It was less than $0.01, so reported and adjusted EPS are identical. That's a 21% increase versus adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2013. Revenues were $3.4 billion, up 5% versus last year on a reported basis. Revenue growth was about 1 point higher than our guide, which was to be up about 4% for the quarter. We saw somewhat stronger revenues in transport, particularly in auxiliary power units and marine equipment. And in commercial HVAC equipment in both North America and Europe, revenues were up 6%, excluding currency.  Orders were up 7% in the third quarter and up 8% excluding currency. Climate orders were up 9%, led by auxiliary power unit, marine unit and commercial HVAC equipment orders. Industrial orders were up 3%. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring, was up 90 basis points. Climate margins increased 120 basis points, and Industrial margins were a headwind of 110 basis points.  For the company, pricing exceeded direct inflation as it has each quarter for more than 3 years. Operating leverage was 31% on an adjusted basis. On a year-to-date basis, we have delivered 110 basis points of margin improvement. We repurchased 2.6 million shares in the third quarter.  We have narrowed the range of our full year forecast at the midpoint of guidance for adjusted EPS at $3.22. It is unchanged and now includes diligence and transaction costs related to the Cameron acquisition that were not in our July guidance. I'll give you some more detail on the fourth quarter and the year in a few minutes after Sue walks you through more details on the third quarter. Sue? Susan Carter : Thanks, Mike. Starting at a high level again, our reported bookings for the quarter were up 7%, revenues were up 5%, and our operating margins without restructuring were up 90 basis points year-over-year. Reported earnings per share were $1.10. Versus midpoint guidance of $1.03, the $0.07 beat came from a few areas. As Mike said, revenue growth was about 1 point higher than midpoint guidance, which would be about $0.03 of earnings. The currency exchange impact from Venezuela, which we had spiked out as an estimate in our third quarter guidance of $10 million cost, or about $0.03, did not occur in the quarter. So that was $0.03 of the $0.07 difference plus the revenue. However, the risk in Venezuela remains, and we've rolled that now into the fourth quarter guidance. The tax rate and share count were each about $0.01 favorable. FX, excluding the Venezuela item, was about $0.01 unfavorable to guidance. So that gives you the full $0.07. Now if you'll go to Slide 4. Orders for the third quarter of 2014 were up 7% on a reported basis and up 8%, excluding currency. Climate orders were up 9%. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digits. Transport orders were up over 20% and as Mike said, led by auxiliary power unit and marine unit orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were up 3%.  So if you go to Slide 5. To look at the revenue trends by segment and regions, the top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, third quarter revenues were up 5% versus last year on a reported basis and up 6%, excluding currency.  Climate revenues increased 6% with commercial HVAC revenues up mid-single digits and transport revenues up mid-teens. Residential HVAC revenues were up low single digits. Industrial revenues were up 3% on a reported basis and excluding currency. I'll give more color on each segment in the next few slides. For the bottom chart, which shows revenue change on a geographic basis, revenues were up 6% in the Americas, 9% in EMEIA and Asia was down 2%, all excluding foreign exchange. Within Asia, China revenues were down mid-single digits in the quarter, with Climate revenues down low teens and Industrial revenues up slightly. Now go to Slide 6. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from third quarter 2013 of 11.8% to third quarter of 2014, which was 13% or an increase of 120 basis points. This chart is on a reported basis. We've clearly spiked out the impact of restructuring costs for you, which was 30 basis points of tailwind year-over-year.  Volume mix and foreign exchange collectively were 80 basis points positive versus prior year. Our pricing programs continued to outpace material inflation, adding 10 basis points to margin. We have been consistently positive on this measure for more than 3 years, although as we foreshadowed in each earnings call this year, the gap has narrowed as we move through 2014. Productivity versus other inflation was 60 basis points of positive impact in the quarter. Year-over-year investments in restructuring were higher by 30 basis points in total. In the box, you can see that, that was comprised of 60 basis points of headwind from investments. Those are new product investments, channel expansion and also IT.  There were -- a 30 basis point benefit from lower restructuring costs. So if you prefer to look at this on an adjusted basis, adjusted margins increased a net of 90 basis points versus the 120 basis points on a reported basis. Leverage in the quarter was 31%, excluding restructuring from last year, and 27% in the segment. Climate's leverage at 34% was strong across both the HVAC and transport businesses, particularly in North America and Europe. Now if you'll go to Slide 7. Let's talk about the Climate segment. The Climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the third quarter were $2.6 billion. That is up 6% versus last year on a reported basis and excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid-single digits. Orders were up mid-single digits in the Americas and Asia. HVAC orders were up more than 20% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, with strong increases in both applied and unitary products. Commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Revenues were also up mid-single digits in the Americas, up low single digits in EMEIA and down in Asia. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were up mid-single digits. HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were also up mid-single digits versus prior year. Growth in worldwide unitary equipment revenues more than offset lower applied revenues.  Thermo King orders were up over 20% versus 2013's third quarter, led by increases in marine equipment, auxiliary power units and North American trailer. Thermo King revenues were up mid-teens with truck/trailer revenue up low teens. Plus, APU and marine equipment revenues were all up over 20%. Residential HVAC revenues were up low single digits versus last year. Unit volumes were also up low single digits and mix was positive. The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 14.3% in the quarter, 120 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2013 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation.  Now let's go to Slide 8. Third quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $741 million, up 3% from last year's third quarter. For the Industrial segment, excluding Club Car, revenues were up low single digits and orders were also up low single digits versus last year. Excluding Club Car, revenues in the Americas and Asia Pacific were up mid-single digits while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa declined. Club Car orders and revenues in the quarter were up slightly. Growth in utility vehicles offset a decline in golf markets in the quarter. Industrial's operating margin of 14.8% was down 110 basis points due to inflation and investment spending, partially offset by higher volume, productivity and pricing. We have increased investment spending in Industrial versus prior year to fund product development in advance of upcoming regulatory changes and infrastructure investments to support channel and services. Let's go to Slide 9. Working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4% of revenue in the quarter. The increase versus prior year is from higher receivables and inventory, partially offset by higher payables balances. Day sales outstanding is up mainly due to mix of business and higher terms in certain geographies such as China. On inventory, we've been intentionally increasing stocked levels -- inventory levels of key assemblies in order to ensure availability of supply.  Year-to-date September free cash flow was $417 million. Our full year cash flow forecast is $800 million to $850 million versus prior guidance of $850 million to $900 million. The change mainly reflects investment we're making in inventories to support key stocking levels and to support the regional standards change in residential HVAC. That translates to free cash flow of 90% to 95% of net income.  Please go to Slide 10. We repurchased 2.6 million shares for approximately $160 million in the third quarter. Year-to-date September, we have spent $1.2 billion in share repurchases and repurchased about 20 million shares. Our forecast for the year remains to spend $1.375 billion on repurchase. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike. Michael Lamach : Great. Thanks, Sue. Please go to Slide 11. In August, we announced our agreement to purchase the centrifugal compressor division of Cameron. This chart was shown during the webcast we held on the day of the announcement. It's a great fit with our Compressed Air business. It generates value for our shareholders and it's accretive to all of our key metrics. It adds to our core compression capabilities and it adds breadth and range to our Compressed Air business. Please go to Slide 12. There are no updates to the timing of the closure. Everything is progressing according to schedule. We still expect to close in the fourth quarter. The forecast, I'll go into next. It does not include any operational results from Cameron. And we'll update you once we know the closing date.  Please go to Slide 13. Our full year revenue forecast for growth of about 4% is unchanged. There's been some movement within the Climate segment where transport is going to come in somewhat stronger given the orders we have in hand for marine containers and APUs that will ship this year, which is offset by somewhat lower HVAC revenues in Latin America and Asia and the impact of negative foreign exchange.  Please go to Slide 14. For the full year, as I said, we still see revenue growth of about 4%. We are adjusting our full year 2014 earnings outlook to a range of $3.17 to $3.21 on a reported basis. For the full year, we now expect to spend about $0.03 in restructuring versus $0.05 in our prior guidance, so on an adjusted basis, in the range of $3.20 to $3.24. This includes absorbing some transaction costs related to the closing of the Cameron acquisition, which again were not in the July guidance. There is no change to the full year average share count guidance of 275 million shares with a tax rate of approximately 25%. Fourth quarter 2014 revenues are forecast to be up approximately 3% to 4%. We expect mid-single-digit growth in Climate and low single-digit growth in Industrial. Fourth quarter GAAP continuing earnings per share forecast to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.72. Restructuring costs are expected to be about $0.01 in the quarter. So on an adjusted basis, the EPS range is $0.69 to $0.73. The difference between the prior fourth quarter guidance and current guidance is from the negative Venezuelan currency impact estimate of $0.03, just timing moving from Q3 to Q4, as Sue discussed, some timing of shipments between Q3 and Q4 versus the July view, and transaction costs related to the closure of the Cameron acquisition, which were not included in our prior guidance. We are assuming an average share count in the fourth quarter of 270 million shares and a tax rate of about 25%. There's an EPS bridge versus last year's fourth quarter in the appendix for your reference. So in closing, we're pleased to have delivered above our earnings commitment in the third quarter with solid performance against some macro headwinds. I continue to feel good about our positioning and our focus as we head into the final quarter of the year. With that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Sprague of the Vertical Research Company. Jeffrey Sprague : Mike, can you give us a little bit more color on what's going on in the applied market, whether you're seeing any signs of a turn there? And maybe if there's any geographic color to put around that as kind of the first part of the question? Michael Lamach : Sure. Applied equipment revenue was down low single digits, but Applied revenues were actually up in North America, kind of mid-single digits. So we saw the weakness really in all regions except North America. And so that really, Jeff, I think is the first quarter that we've seen kind of mid-single-digit growth. And I think if we were to see another quarter or 2 of that, we'd feel better, going into 2015, that there would be a moderate recovery in institutional construction. Jeffrey Sprague : And then secondly, just on Industrial, can you give us some color on the investment spend? And maybe more importantly, how does it continue going forward? Obviously, there's some spike out in your walk. But maybe give us some color on where that lays geographically between the segments? And do we see that tapering off into the new year? Susan Carter : Let me give that a shot, Jeff, and talk a little bit about Industrial. And I'll kind of broaden the question a little bit and talk about some of the things that we were doing. So when we think about Industrial and we think about where we are and where we are with the third quarter results, there's a piece of this that says as we've gone through 2014 and we've looked at this. The first quarter created quite a hole for us. And we knew that, and we knew it was going to take some aggressive actions to get back to the target on operating income margins for the year. In addition to that, as we've gone through the year, we've been looking at these businesses, sort of the new structure. And we've been looking at growth and the business has prioritized good payback investments that are going to support growth. They're going to support product development, service infrastructure investments, channel investments like I talked about in the script. And so as we were going through the third quarter, we looked at where we were. Again, Climate has been overachieving. We did accelerate some of the investment in Industrial. And again, looking at new products to prepare them for the upcoming technology efficiency standards, investments in channel and services. And in addition to that, as we thought about the back half of the year, we were expecting perhaps more recovery in Club Car than what occurred. So golf markets have really remained down as we've gone through the year. And so when we think about Industrial then going forward, nothing that we're seeing in the investments that we're making -- it's not going to change our longer-term margin opportunity for Industrial, and we expect them to have margin improvement in 2015. Michael Lamach : Jeff, I'd probably add on here a little bit and say when you back up and look at the longer-term guidance we've given, around 15% to 20% EPS growth in '14, '15 and '16, we're tracking at about 21%, at the midpoint of the guidance we're giving right now. And with bookings being so strong in the third quarter and really setting up well for the fourth quarter in 2015, there's no reason, when we see a good idea here, not to act on it and pull it forward and really build and protect against that 15%, 20% EPS growth in '15 and '16. So I think that there are no surprises here. And I want to emphasize there's absolutely nothing wrong with this business. These are investments that we fully expect to have a return in '15 and '16, and we would expect that business to return to normal incremental margin expectation in '15 and '16. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Just wanted to follow up on Jeff's point on the Industrial margins. And I just want to -- you called out 2 points, one was the investment spending, which you just went through. That sounds like that's going to taper into 4Q and '15. But you also called out inflationary pressures as well, so maybe just discuss that. And Mike, I couldn't help but to reiterate that you put out that 15% to 20% for '15. So do you still feel comfortable with that target for '15 right now? Michael Lamach : Yes, Nigel, first of all, we've laid out a 15% to 20% '14, '15 and '16. '14 happened about how we thought relative to growth in the market : leverage, core share count, tax and buyback all being factors that are yielding a year that should be just a bit up top of that range. And again, we're looking at this thing a little longer term, not just quarter-to-quarter. And there's some opportunity particularly in the Industrial segment, where we think that we can accelerate growth much like we're seeing that acceleration right now in the Climate business. And it's going to take just a little bit of investment, and we want to be smart about that. But I have no reason to have any different expectation than 15%, 20% EPS growth in '15 and '16 as we see it now. Susan Carter : And then the piece, Nigel, on your question on the inflation that we referenced in the press release, so there is a bit of material inflation that happens on the Industrial side of the business. Again it's not something that is unexpected, but it is inflationary pressure. There is also inflation that occurs from our businesses with people, with compensation and different pieces of just year-over-year inflation. Again, none of that would be an unexpected event for the businesses. What you balance that with is that sometimes in the businesses, and this in particular occurred with the Industrial side, is that the productivity is a little lumpy, which means that we had some productivity that was better in Q2 versus Q3. But the inflation numbers were a little higher in Q3 than they were in Q2. So you've got some flips and -- puts and takes between the couple of quarters. But again, there is not an inflation that is something we wouldn't expect or that's unusual for the business. I mean, these are normal things that occur. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Douglass of Longbow Research. Mark Douglass : Can you discuss -- you've talked about Applied, but Unitary must have been at least up high single digits. Can you discuss what's going on in commercial Unitary? Michael Lamach : Yes, actually, a very successful quarter for us. Worldwide, Unitary equipment was up high teens in the third quarter, so that was a success. Trane commercial unitary revenues were up by low teens in the third quarter. That was certainly a positive for us as well, high single digit in the Americas, very strong growth in Europe and a decline in Asia. So again, high teens Unitary orders and then good revenue flow-through in the quarter across the Unitary business, again, low teens, good, continued success in the Americas, high single digits. EMEIA was really outstanding, again, sort of a high mid-teens in Europe -- Western Europe, I should say; a little bit higher than that in the Middle East. And all that brought down by the events of what was happening in Eastern Europe, so a good quarter. Mark Douglass : And then can you talk about how you're approaching the regional standards in the U.S. in resi? Are you anticipating a significant prebuild, but not necessarily prebuy in fourth quarter? And how are you seeing that play out with your distributors in 2015? Michael Lamach : Yes, I'd say, Mark, as of today, the impact is going to be very different for each OEM depending on what their channel structure is. So I think you're going to see different results that are going to phase in over the year. And actually, you're seeing some volatility in order and shipment rates between OEMs in the res business. As you probably know, we own part of the distribution, and part of it's independent. We have been talking to our distributors and our dealers. And even among them, it's not one size fits all. It depends on their liquidity, the stocking capacity and the strategy that they want to employ themselves for managing the transition. But as we see it today, we'll have some prebuy and we'll certainly have some prebuild in the fourth quarter. And so we're following the situation closely. We have plans in place for both, and we're flexible enough to adjust accordingly as it evolves within the quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : I just wanted to follow up on the overall segment incremental margin. So I think you talked in July that it should be in the mid-30s this year. And if that's still the case, that would imply maybe mid- or high-20s for Q4. I just wanted to check that was still correct. And then related to that, should we see that number pick up into next year, more akin to the gross margin level of sort of 30%, 31%? Susan Carter : So I think, Julian, when we look at the full year of 2014 and at the midpoint level for the full year, what you see is an incremental leverage of about 33%. And then in the fourth quarter, what you have is a segment leverage of about 30%. So overall, when you look at first half, second half, they're pretty evenly weighted. And again, I think as we talk about going forward, we would continue to expect that sort of the threshold would be at the gross margin level for leverage expectation. Michael Lamach : Yes, as I said, Julian, I think early in the year, prudent modeling would probably have us telling you something more like 25%, allowing for breakage. When things go right for us, like they've done a lot this year, we might see something closer to gross margins. And in fact, depending on where that business is coming in to us, there could be some leverage against fixed assets, depending on what we've done there at the time. So 30% is probably a good, more aggressive number, 25% more prudent, and there'll be some volatility. I think any -- in quarter-to-quarter, but again over the full year and then over a long period of time, now 4 or 5 years, we've been able to pretty consistently have those top quartile incremental margins. And that's a pretty important part of our commitment and strategy for how we'll run the business. Julian Mitchell : And then just on the Industrial business, yes, I just wanted to clarify that price/mix for you was about 0 in that business in Q2. Was it around 0 in Q3? Or it went negative? Susan Carter : No, it was around 0 in Q3 also. Michael Lamach : Yes, Julian, price would have been just a touch higher than material inflation, but so close that Sue is rounding it correctly to about flat. Susan Carter : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Winoker of Bernstein Research. Steven Winoker : I just wanted to get a little more clarity on the $0.07 you called out for the Q4 reduction versus last guidance. So $0.03 on Venezuelan currency. And then is it fair to say the other $0.04 is all revenue related, and some mix of that that's FX and something else? Because it sounds like you're calling out continued strength in margins. So maybe just a little more clarity in terms of how you broke that out or how you're thinking about that. I'm looking at the bridge, but the bridge is just year-on-year and not your change in thinking from last quarter to this quarter. Susan Carter : Right. So what you would end up with, Steve, is you'd have the Venezuela, as we called it out, we also called out having some of the Cameron costs that were in there. And as we had said in August, when we announced the transaction, about $0.01 or $0.02 on the costs for the Cameron piece. And then as you think about it and as we talked about it today, we may have had some revenue that was pulled into Q3 versus Q4. So nothing again other than really sort of those raw components, but the biggest 2 pieces being Venezuela and also the addition of the expected Cameron transaction costs. Michael Lamach : Yes, simply for me, Steve, you -- just to reiterate, 3 pretty much coming out of Venezuela, a couple coming out of Cameron, one currency maybe, even? And the balance of that is just being a little bit more sensitive to the volatility of what we're seeing with some of the order rates. And China is a great example where you're seeing volatility, one strong bookings quarter followed by a weak bookings quarter and then lagged, of course, to a revenue quarter and so on and so forth. And so there's some volatility here. Latin America is weaker, and I don't think it's going to change for the balance of the year, in addition to China. So it's a little bit of market, but I would say the market is -- it's probably $0.01, exchange is a $0.01, and then the balance is just Cameron and Venezuela. Susan Carter : What I would also say, though, for those on the call is we pegged Venezuela at $10 million as we went through the midpoint of the year, which is what we had in the third quarter numbers, and we've rolled that into the fourth quarter numbers. That's an extremely volatile situation. The number could be different than the $10 million. But we weren't going to play with making any changes in our overall guidance for what that might be doing because we just simply don't know. I mean, it is just going to continue to move. And if there is a negative impact from that, we'll balance it off of the $10 million, but that's not a known number. That's the piece that we've put into the guidance, and we'll continue to monitor that with things down there. And I just wanted to make sure that everyone is clear that that's the number that we arrived at and put into the guidance. Steven Winoker : Sue, is that -- which exchange rate did you use to get to that? Susan Carter : The -- I think it's [indiscernible], right? So the normal rates, so it wasn't the SICAD I or II rate. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then for my second question, if I could, just the VRF, what are you seeing on VRF penetration? And how that's affecting you, good and bad, for the quarter? Michael Lamach : I -- can you repeat it? Steven Winoker : Yes, the variable refrigerant [ph] flow -- VRF penetration in the quarter? Michael Lamach : We had really good growth in the quarter, Steve, really good growth in the quarter in all regions of the world. And as I always point out continued penetration of ducted and ductless markets as well. So it's a good balanced approach, but good success with VRF, excellent growth coming in all regions with the line. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : On the resi stuff, so should we just basically think about the difference in free cash flow as kind of your best estimate of the type of inventory you're going to build for this transition? Michael Lamach : There's puts and takes in there, Steve. We would normally have, without a prebuild, sort of a wind-down and lower working capital we kind of add back on top of that. So it's not completely in that number, but the change in thinking, certainly, I think, would be attributable largely to our thoughts around a prebuild. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then when you think about the transition, do you expect it to have -- there a lot of moving parts here, I mean, do you expect it to be kind of a net impact next year, if you think about the kind of mid-single-digit industry trend line that we're in right now? I mean, is -- given this is more of a prebuild than a prebuy? Any kind of impacts around margins or growth that you want to call out as you guys kind of plan for this thing here? Michael Lamach : Well, it's a little too soon, Steve. We've got to see what happens with, certainly, 14 SEER pricing. And then just in terms of dynamics as it plays out with each OEM in its own strategy as to how much inventory they're prebuilding and holding. And again, that's a factor of how quickly does 14 come down to being -- a push against 13. And I would say that over time, and possibly a relatively short period of time, you're going to see some focus on cost reductions coming into the 14 SEER units across the competitive base. And so there's a lot of play there for us to make a call on that now. So the other point I would make, back to the working capital question, there was some other selective areas where there's quite a bit of order volatility. As an example, marine container, auxiliary power units, even the TK units that go on trucks. So it's the vehicle-powered and self-powered truck units. A lot of volatility in the order rates there. Those are nice businesses for us. And so you've got us holding and bringing in more component inventory of long-lead items to be able to build against that demand. And it's really a fine-tuning of the working capital to the upside to ensure that we've got the ability to take advantage of really good progress in order rates across those businesses. C. Stephen Tusa : What is your mix now -- the last question. What is your mix now of just the baseline 13 SEER? What will mix of 13 SEER be this year as a percentage of your volume? Michael Lamach : I don't even know if I have that handy, Steve. I'll tell you what, we'll look for it. Take the next question, and I'll answer that as we go here. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Robert Barry : Just a quick follow-up. First, on the resi HVAC impact, how much are you factoring from that in the 4Q outlook? Michael Lamach : Well, for the industry, our view of units in the industry has been something to the neighborhood of 5 points of normal growth and probably a couple of points of growth associated with prebuild and trip. So we end up with sort of a mid- to high-single-digit residential environment. That's the environment we think we're playing into and our plans would be commensurate with that. Robert Barry : That couple of points, is that for just the fourth quarter? Or is it for the year, so it'll be higher in the fourth quarter? Michael Lamach : I think in the industry, it started already. We had, competitively, one large OEM that had a ERP system conversion and put about 30 days of extra inventory into the channel. We've had a couple of other OEM competitors that have had more aggressive campaigns against -- moving into the channel. So some of it happened in Q3. I think more of it will happen in Q4. But in total, I think it's a couple of points probably to NBU [ph] volumes, which would put you somewhere in neighborhood of a range of a low end of 700,000 and a high end maybe 1 million units in market being prebuilt. Robert Barry : Yes. And then just finally, could you just update us on what you're seeing changed in Europe since the last quarter? In particular Industrial, I know it was particularly strong in 2Q. I think it ended up being down a little bit in this quarter. I know that's lumpy, but -- and then in TK in particular, just what you're seeing in the Europe environment? Michael Lamach : Yes, thanks. In Industrial, it is choppy. And so I think your question, you have the answer in it as well. It absolutely has been choppy -- large centrifugal air compressor orders are going to be a big swing factor there, and that was a difference for us as well. With TK, it's been, again, strong growth in Western Europe. Of course, marine container is strong. But very, very slow and weak growth in Eastern Europe. Or really no growth, I mean, really no business. It's really dried up until things normalize there. And then with smaller vehicles, again, small trucks, that's moderated somewhat as well. So TK is slowing down a little bit in Europe, but we're picking it up in other areas like in marine. And Industrial, I would expect to see some choppiness, but in essence, to be able to continue to move toward that kind of 1% to 3% sort of growth rate for the year and probably after a couple of quarters. I don't see any big shocks happening there. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Buckingham Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just first on the Applied side, I mean you talked about strong revenue growth there. I think you have a really tough order comp from last year on a new product line. Can you talk about what orders did? And then I guess prospectively, how those are coming along either in quote log or conversations with your customers? Michael Lamach : Well, you've got one solid quarter, I think, of North American growth. And if you recall, we said last quarter that we felt like we're seeing an inflection point. And so you have the inflection point off the bottom. You've had one quarter of good kind of growth. We don't really subscribe to the McGraw-Hill data view that says that there's a sort of 10-point hop happening in 2015 institutional construction. I think that we're more likely to see a multiyear kind of mid-single digit, or on a given quarter or 2 it may touch high single-digit Applied rate. And many, many reasons for that, some of which include the availability of skilled trades and labor to work on these projects for institutional customers. So -- and that's very consistent with what we're seeing for inquiries and what we're seeing in the pipeline of projects that we're looking at. So I'd like to see another quarter or 2, Josh, before we'd say that not only is an inflection point, but is a trend that we would feel good about calling for 2015. But I think it's pointed in the right direction for a moderate year. And again, a stronger but more moderated recovery than what McGraw-Hill is projecting. Joshua Pokrzywinski : What were orders in Applied in the quarter? Michael Lamach : Well, I think you're mostly thinking about North America Applied because that's where we would see typically the institutional recovery that we... Joshua Pokrzywinski : Right, right. Michael Lamach : Yes, that was mid-single digit. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Okay. And I do recall, right, that it was a tough comp from last year from that new product? Michael Lamach : That's right. Joshua Pokrzywinski : And then just a follow-up question. As you see raw mat playing out, obviously, the war on copper has taken down exposure to that over time. How do you feel about that, that price-cost gap that has been narrowing through the year? As we get into next year, should that stay narrow? Is there an opportunity for that to widen out? Or just -- or it could actually go negative if demand stays choppy? Michael Lamach : I think it stays fairly narrow. And we've had very good success for some 3 or maybe more years now of driving price in excess of material inflation. It could invert a quarter or 2. I don't see that happening, but it could happen. But I would expect that over time, over 3 or 4 quarters of time rolling, you would see a slight premium to material inflation. And that's just what we've built into the operating system and into the expectations of product management and in the way that our people get compensated themselves. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got you. And then, I guess, just underneath that, if I can squeeze in one more on the 13 SEER prebuild. Would there be any change in your view on industry pricing for that 13 SEER product versus what it's priced at today? Michael Lamach : It's anybody's guess on that. So it's the Wild West, I think, as it comes to expectations around what really happens on that. But look, at some point, it's not the richest margin project -- product that anybody is selling. And so I think the sensitivity around price/cost is narrow enough that there's not going to be really anything crazy happening there. I mean, why go through the effort of prebuilding if in fact you're going to give it away as part of the 2014 equation? So -- or 2015 equation? So I don't really see that as being a significant problem. And then Steve, back to your question, I think it's about 60%, 6-0, on the 13 SEER mix for us. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question on restructuring. We lowered it from $0.05 to $0.03. Are we doing less? Are we changing the timing? Are we being more effective? Susan Carter : I think as we have looked at restructuring for 2014, Andrew, we started out with a forecast that said we had a lot of plans that we actioned in the fourth quarter of 2013, and sort of a normalized level would be in the $0.05 to $0.10 range in 2014. And as we've gone through the year, what we've done, as a natural part of the business, is we've looked for opportunities that made sense. But we did do some pretty heavy lifting on restructuring in the fourth quarter. And so as we've gone through the year, we sort of let this naturally fall out with things that we needed to do and things that fit the construct of how we were running the business. And it just happens to be $0.03 this year. That isn't a predictor of what the future will be. But we have put in basically a placeholder that said what was normal. And given the work that we did at the end of last year and actually the first couple of months of 2014, just wasn't as necessary throughout 2014, so we're at $0.03. Michael Lamach : And the maintenance, Andrew, I think is sort of -- if you look back over a longer period of time, the sort of maintenance that we do around the footprint probably gets you to some sort of $0.05 that we would put in, to be prudent every year. But it's not the big story. We're generally always looking at, but generally happy with, where the footprint actually is, what utilization is and what the available capacity is, hopefully going into some growth coming into '15 and '16, particularly in the HVAC commercial businesses. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question on the Industrial. As you are pushing into oil-free compressor space with more capacity, should we be concerned that one of your European competitors would push back and would somehow impair the structural profitability of the market space? Michael Lamach : Well, I'm sure if they did, they'd be impairing their own profitability, so I'm not sure if that wins anybody's sort of affection in that regard. I would say that the investments that we're making are fewfold. One is there's been some efficiency rules put in place in China for air compressors. That's moving to Europe, and I think it will be adopted soon and that eventually in early conversations with the DOE, it will come to the U.S. and other countries as well. And so it's really getting in front of a lot of these 2017, '18 and '19 efficiency requirements. Our belief is that the brand promise has been around energy efficiency and around reliability. And so what we want to be able to do is be able to continue to sell the most efficient, most reliable products in the marketplace. And that's really what the investment is. Certainly, it's not indicative of some oil-free pressure that we're seeing around pricing. It's not the story that we had in Q3 or Q4 around the compression in margin. It really is we have not seen the golf recovery, although orders are up a little bit. We certainly haven't seen shipments improve across golf. That's hurt. And then we pulled forward a number of NPD and channel investments to set ourselves up into '15 and '16, particularly -- well, across all of the Industrial businesses x Club Car. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann of Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Just a quick follow-up on Thermo King. I know you guys have had some new product there. It seems like it's going fairly well. Kind of what's going on? What's driving the strength? Is it an upgrade cycle? Do you think you're taking any share? And then I'm curious if there's been any move in the margins in that business with the new product as well. Michael Lamach : Last question first. The incremental margins have been right at expectation and pretty consistent with past performance when the business is growing and leveraged. There's nothing unique or really remarkable about the leverage that we're seeing there. In fact, in the Climate segment, the remarkable leverage has come from the commercial and residential Trane businesses in particular. The growth that we're seeing is certainly highest in APUs. When you think about what our truck customers face, the #1 issue that they have is the availability of drivers. A couple of large customers told me that drivers only last about 9 months in that business. But some of the larger companies have found that by installing APUs in their cabs, they're able to significantly increase driver retention. And so that's one of the reasons we're seeing APUs really expand dramatically even though fuel prices have dropped. And it used to be that APUs increased as fuel prices increased, but this is a disconnect. Fuel crude [ph] prices are dropping and the driver is really around driver-retention more than anything. Marine container has been good, particularly gen sets into marine containers have been very strong for us. And we continue to leverage new product, which is more expensive with the tier 4 new CARB requirements coming into play, and that's driven a lot of, obviously, the revenue upside for us as well. Stephen Volkmann : Great. And then, Mike, any thoughts as we get into 2015 about sort of capital allocation? I know you're in the process of obviously a big acquisition here. But how do we think about things like share repurchases next year or your appetite for further M&A? Michael Lamach : Nothing's changed in terms of wanting to be as smart and practical in pragmatic uses of capital in terms of how we're our thinking about it. We have said that the dividend needs to be 30% to 35%, and we're going to continue to keep pushing on that to make sure that we're competitive in the peer group. We're going to control any share dilution, so share buybacks will continue to be a part of the story. And then depending on what's best from there, which would probably toggle between share repurchase and acquisitions that are accretive to us and accretive in the short term. And we'll see where that goes, but we'll guide more in 2015 on that. But wouldn't expect anything different than what we've been saying over the last couple, few years. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeffrey Hammond : Hey, just to follow on Josh's question on pricing. It looks like in late September, you put through a 2% to 5% price increase in North America commercial. Can you just talk about what's driving that? And what are you seeing from your competitors? Michael Lamach : Well, mostly what's happening is just freight prices are really increasing, particularly flatbed. And so where you're moving really large pieces of equipment, so chillers or extremely large rooftop units, of which I think you know we've got a very high share of, those are moved typically over one or more flatbeds as opposed to closed-body trucks. And the theoretical utilization of flatbeds is like 106% right now in the marketplace, which isn't possible other than if you look at what's happening. You've got prices going up and trucking companies not really investing in new fleets because they can't find drivers. So that's the primary driver there is freight for us, and I think that our competitors are seeing the same thing. We probably, as a mix, have a higher degree of that just due to the mix of Applied versus Unitary and even the large Unitary mix that we have versus their Unitary. Some of our competitors only go up to 30, 40 tons, and of course, we go up to 150 tons of unitary, which can take 2 or 3 semis to move. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. That's helpful. And then just back to the Europe commercial HVAC orders being up 20. Can you just -- is there any kind of good lumpiness in there? Is there a share gain? It just seems kind of an outlier versus what we're hearing in Europe. Michael Lamach : Well, we've had that outlier happening now for a while, so I can't -- probably can't hide -- I can't look past the results there. We're doing really well in Europe. New product launches have gone extremely well. We've got a great management team on the ground that's very energized. And I don't know how long it will persist, but we're enjoying it for the time being. Operator : And our last question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So my first question is really around the, I guess, the elevated investment that you talked about in Industrial. Clearly, it seems to make a lot of sense, given that you're tracking ahead of your 20% EPS growth target and you're looking to protect your investment in coming years. I guess my question, though, is how much has that incremental spending increased this year? I think you guys were talking about like a $60 million plus type rate for '14. So I'm just wondering how much that's changed. Susan Carter : So Joe, the -- if I'm going to add where we are in a full year now, we're probably adding $9 million to $10 million to that $65 million. So it now looks more like $74 million, $75 million on the incremental basis. Joseph Ritchie : Okay, great. That's helpful, Sue. And just my one follow-up is really on just Industrial margins. I think, when we most recently spoke, I think the expectations were to at least kind of try to hold those margins flat. I fully understand that you're investing more in that business today, but what's the expectation now embedded in your 4Q guidance for Industrial margins? And then the corollary to that is how do you think about those margins moving forward into '15 on an organic basis? Clearly, Cameron is going to change things, but it'd be helpful to hear your thoughts there as well. Michael Lamach : So one thing in particular, Sue gave you an absolutely true and factual corporate number, which is around circa $10 million of investment. But even if you look at the mix change of that $10 million, it's shifting much more toward Industrial than it is to Climate. Climate has been very efficient with their plans. And so we've shifted actually more of that than the 10 [ph] to Industrial and a little less in Climate. So that's a bigger impact to the Climate margin than just the absolute $10 million for the company. Incremental margins there should look to recover in 2015, probably certainly at the gross margins. And then depending on weather in Q1 and Q2 of next year, meaning we don't have multiple ice storms and the severity that we had, in Club Car, we should not have a repeat of the Club Car in golf environment Q1 and Q2. And that was a, I'm guessing, $20 million impact to us probably in the first quarter. So if you don't repeat that, you get back to the normal incremental margins in the business, hopefully, with a little higher growth rate, okay, which is something we're looking at, too, as what can we do through these investments to drive a little higher growth rates than what we were thinking. We should get incremental margins at or above gross margins for Air in 2015. So as we enter into that planning process and enter into guidance with you when we talk to you soon in the first quarter, we're going to tune that, but that would be a pretty good indicator of what -- at least my expectation and I know Sue's expectations would be going in. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. That's helpful. Just one -- maybe one follow-up to that is the investment. What's the investment level expected in Industrial in 4Q? And what's that delta versus 3Q? Michael Lamach : I'm trying to look. It's -- probably don't have that broken out exactly where you can see it. It's probably 50 basis points, yes. Operator : Thank you. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call back to management for any closing comments. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, Sam. Thank you, everyone. And I will be available for follow-ups. Everyone have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ma'am. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Janet Pfeffer, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relation. Please go ahead. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2014 Conference Call. We released earnings at 7 this morning, and the release is posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting, in addition to this phone call, through our website at ingersollrand.com, where you will find the slide presentation that we'll be using. The call will be recorded and archived on our website.  If you'd please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from anticipated results. This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables to our news release. Now I'd like to introduce the participants on this morning' s call : Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations.  With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Great. Thank you, Janet. Good morning, and thanks for joining us for today's call.  This morning, I'll spend a few minutes recapping our full year 2014 and our progress on the transformation that we've been working on in the company for the past few years. Then Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results, and I'll end with our outlook for 2015 before we open it up to your questions. So starting with full year 2014. The past year demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multiyear strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in our core businesses, maturing key strategic capabilities and delivered excellent financial results, all while navigating shifts and changes in global markets.  For the year, our revenues were up 4%. Markets were uneven around the globe. Our growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa was double digits, where I believe we outpaced the market in most or all of our businesses. Growth in North America was mid-single digits, while revenues in Latin America and Asia were lower for the full year due to market and currency headwinds.  Adjusted earnings per share were $3.33, a year-over-year increase of 25%. Sue will take you through the bridge in a few minutes, so I'll leave that for Sue. On the quarter, there'll be some puts and takes, but the short answer is that volume and operational leverage were better than guidance, particularly in the Climate segment. We grew adjusted operating margins 140 basis points in 2014. Our Lean focus again showed significant results in the implemented value streams, and we continued to invest in the future of the business by funding significant new product development, investing in IT platforms and building our channel, services footprint and product management capabilities.  We generated $810 million of cash flow. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value, and it's consistent with our overall financial strategy.  We continued to increase our dividend, with a 19% increase in 2014. We repurchased 22 million shares for $1.4 billion in 2014, funded by the remaining Allegion dividend and from free cash flow.  We announced 2 value-enhancing acquisitions during 2014 : the purchase of the Cameron Centrifugal Compressor division, which closed at the beginning of this month and is now part of our Compressed Air business units; and Frigoblock, which we expect to close in the first half of 2015, which will become part of our Thermo King transport refrigeration business unit.  Our performance in 2014, where we outperformed the 3-year glide path we laid out in late 2013, confirms our conviction to our strategy can position us well going into a challenging global economic backdrop for 2015.  Let's go to Slide 4. We have delivered steady improvements in operating margins over the past 3 years. Climate margins are up 340 basis points over that period. Overall, operating margins are up 230 basis points over the last 3 years despite a tough year in Industrial for 2014. And as I'll review when I go through 2015 guidance, we expect Industrial to recover and have 40% organic operating leverage in 2015.  Please go to Slide 5. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from 2013 at 8.9% to 2014, which was 10.9%. This is shown on a reported basis, but we spiked out restructuring for you in the box. Overall margins expanded 200 basis points on a reported basis and 140 basis points on an adjusted basis. The margin expansion was delivered from a combination of organic growth, driven by our strategies to invest in new product and service offerings, maintaining a positive gap between pricing and material inflation through price analytics and value pricing; and productivity from strategic sourcing, implementing our Lean operating system and overhead cost discipline, altogether outpacing other inflation. We continued to invest in new products, IT infrastructure and systems. And service and sales footprint underpin the future growth of the business. 2014's margin performance exceeded our annual goal of delivering 85 to 100 basis points of margin improvement. I've always said that most improvements are not typically linear. But being ahead of the goal going into 2015 is a great place to be, given the sharp movements the world is seeing in exchange rates and oil and metals markets and the economic ripples that, that will create.  So now Sue will walk you through the fourth quarter, and I'll come back to take you through 2015's outlook. Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 6, please. At the high level, our bookings for the quarter were up 5%. Revenues were also up 5%. Foreign exchange was 2 percentage points of headwind to both. So excluding foreign exchange, both orders and revenues were up 7%. Our operating margins without restructuring were up 230 basis points, and operating leverage in the quarter was excellent at 61%.  Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.82, up 34% versus last year. And consistent with Mike's commentary for the full year, the fourth quarter was a very strong quarter, particularly in terms of margin expansion and earnings performance.  Let me start by taking you through a bridge to our guidance for the quarter. Let's go to Slide 7. As you'll recall, we updated our guidance on October 24 to reflect the incremental interest expense from the bond issuance and early retirement of our 2015 notes. So our starting point, on a reported basis, is a range of $0.63 to $0.67 or a midpoint of $0.65. I'll take it all the way to an adjusted basis since that seems to be where most of you are tracking.  Volume and operational performance, particularly in Climate, delivered $0.11 incremental to guidance. Our financial statements continue to reflect the official rate in Venezuela, and therefore, we did not book the $0.03 charge which was included in our guidance. Movements in currencies, including the euro, Asian and Latin American currencies, resulted in a $0.04 negative versus guidance, and there were $0.04 of other positive items mainly in other income. That brings us to $0.79 of reported earnings per share. There were $0.03 of add-back in the quarter to bring you to the $0.82 on an adjusted basis.  So with that, let's go to Slide 8, please. Orders for the fourth quarter of 2014 were up 5% on a reported basis and up 7% excluding currency. Climate orders were up 6% and up 8% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digits. Transport orders were up high single digits led by North American trailer. Orders in the industrial segment were up 3% on a reported basis and up 6% excluding currency. Given that more of Industrial's revenues come from outside of the U.S., its foreign currency impact is larger than in Climate. We saw order growth in all regions in the air and industrial products and a small decline in Club Car.  Please go to Slide 9. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, fourth quarter revenues were up 5% versus last year on a reported basis and up 7% excluding currency. Climate revenues increased 5% on a reported basis and 7% excluding foreign exchange. Commercial HVAC and transport revenues were each up mid-single digits. Residential HVAC revenues were up high single digits. Industrial revenues were up 3% on a reported basis and up 6% excluding currency. And I'll give more color on each segment in the next few slides. The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis with and without currency. Excluding currency, revenues were up 6% in the Americas; up 22% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, led by strong HVAC performance; and Asia was down 3%.  Please go to Slide 10. This chart shows the change in operating margin from fourth quarter 2013 of 7% to fourth quarter 2014 which was 10.7%. Consistent with prior quarters, this is shown on a reported basis, but we spiked out the restructuring to give you adjusted margins as well. Volume mix and foreign exchange collectively were 70 basis points positive versus prior year. Pricing was slightly less than direct material inflation, impacted by negative price in Asia, mainly China. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 210 basis points, driven by strong productivity in the quarter. Year-over-year investments in other items were lower by 100 basis points. And in the box, you can see that this was comprised of 40 basis points from investments and 140 basis points from lower restructuring costs. In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was excellent at 61%.  Please go to Slide 11. The Climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion. That is up 5% versus last year on a reported basis and also up 7% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid-single digits. Orders were up in all geographic regions.  Trane's commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were up mid-single digits. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues were up low single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were up high single digits versus prior year.  Thermo King orders were up high single digits versus 2013's fourth quarter, with a significant increase in North American trailer orders. Thermo King revenues were up mid-single digits, with truck/trailer revenue down, as increases in North America were more than offset by lower revenues in foreign exchange overseas.  Residential HVAC revenues were up high single digits versus last year.  The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 12.2% in the quarter, 210 basis points higher than fourth quarter 2013 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation. Climate's operating leverage was over 50% in the quarter.  Please go to Slide 12. Fourth quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $795 million, up 3% on a reported basis and up 6% excluding currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and material management revenues and orders were up low single digits versus last year. Revenues in the Americas were up mid-single digits, while revenues in Europe and Asia were down low single digits, including impact of currency. Club Car revenues in the quarter were up mid-single digits, and orders were down low single digits versus prior year. Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 15.8% was slightly down compared with last year as volume and productivity was offset by the impact of inflation, investments and currency. Please go to Slide 13. For the full year, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 3.1%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory. This includes some incremental inventory related to the regional standards change in residential HVAC. Additionally, we have been intentionally increasing stock inventory levels of key assemblies in order to ensure availability of supply. We had good collections in the quarter, with our days sales outstanding and days payable outstanding both improving over the prior year. Going forward, we expect our working capital to be in the 3% to 4% range.  Please go to Slide 14. Cash flow was $810 million in 2014. Cash conversion was 87% for the year, held below our long-term target of 100% mainly by our strategy for working capital as I addressed on the last slide. As you will see when we look at 2015, we expect to be back at that 100% target this year.  Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year, given the financing we did on October and the early retirement of the 2015 notes. Our cash balance was unusually high at the end of December as we had the cash on hand to fund the Cameron acquisition on January 2 of 2015. We expect free cash flow in 2015 to be the range of $950 million to $1 billion. And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Mike to take you through 2015 guidance. Michael Lamach : Great. Thanks, Sue, and please go to Slide 15. It's certainly an interesting time to try to predict exactly what will happen over the next 11 months in order to give you guidance. In the past few months, the world has experienced discontinuities in oil markets and in foreign exchange rates. So I will give you the best view of what we see in our markets sitting here today and some more color on how we could be impacted from further movements in foreign exchange.  Starting with North American nonresidential. We anticipate the first positive year in institutional markets since 2008, albeit in a more moderate pace than the current Dodge forecast. We have started to see some positive signs in our quoting pipelines, particularly in K-12 education. We continue to see growth in commercial and industrial, and based on this, we expect mid-single-digit growth for 2015 in North American commercial HVAC markets. We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to be up low to mid-single digits at constant currency but flat to down after considering currency.  We expect North American transport market to be up mid-single digits in 2015 and European markets to be down including FX.  We expect residential HVAC industry motor-bearing unit shipments for the year to up low single digits in 2015. The revenue should be up mid-single digits due to favorable mix. We expect industrial markets to be up low to mid-single digits, and golf markets are expected to be up low single digits. Aggregating those market backdrops, we'd expect our full -- revenues for the full year to be up 4% to 5% versus 2014.  Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 3 percentage points. We'll report the Cameron's centrifugal business for the entire year, and that's going to add 3 points. So for organic growth excluding FX, we'll end back at the 4% to 5% range.  Translating that to our full year outlook by segment, we expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% excluding currency. The Industrial segment revenues are forecasted to be in the range of up 13% to 14% on a reported basis and 4% to 5%, excluding Cameron and foreign exchange.  As Sue noted, Industrial has a higher proportion of revenues outside of the U.S. as compared to Climate, so Industrial experiences more impact from FX relative to Climate.  For operating margins, we expect Climate margins to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. We expect Industrial margins, including Cameron operations and amortization, but excluding the impact of inventory step-up, to be 14.5% to 15.5%. The inventory step-up will be recorded in the first and second quarters that's about $12 million per quarter. Since it's noncash and isolated to those 2 quarters, we felt it was more representative of ongoing earnings to spike out the step-up. I should note that we are in the final validation stages for the purchase accounting for Cameron. So the amortization and step-up numbers might move around a little, but this is our best estimate as of right now. If you peel out the Cameron impact, the legacy Industrial business is leveraging at about 40%. Please go to Slide 16. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $3.60 to $3.75 per share. Excluding the Cameron inventory step-up, which is $0.06, the range is $3.66 to $3.81, an increase of 10% to 14% versus 2014. When you exclude the impact of bringing Cameron's revenue and earnings in for the first time this year, the legacy company is leveraging at about 40% [ph].  Given the outperformance in 2014 with full year EPS growth of 25%, we are on path for our articulated 3-year CAGR growth target range of 15% to 20% even in the face of headwinds from currency and uneven markets. As a note, for 2015, FX is a headwind that's about 3% to revenue and $0.17 to earnings. This reflects a full year tax rate forecast of 25% and an average diluted share count of 270 million shares.  To give you some more insight into the sensitivity to additional movement in currency, in 2014, about 63% of our revenues were denominated in dollars and 7% is in China. And of the remaining 30%, the euro is about 10%; Asia, outside of China and Latin America were 6% to 7% each; and other currencies, such as the Canadian dollar, the British pound, make up the remainder.  So while much of focus has been on the movement and outlook for the euro, currency movements in Asia and the Americas have been significant. For example, between August and December, the yen, Aussie dollar and Malaysian ringgit all moved down 10% to 15%. And since half of our revenues in Asia are outside of China, this has an impact.  We've built our guidance around the euro at $1.16. To give you some simple math to gauge sensitivity, a EUR 0.01 move in the euro means about $0.01 in earnings. And if all currencies move 1% versus the dollar, although it's very unlikely that they would all move with the same magnitude, that would be about $0.02 of earnings. Now to focus on the first quarter guidance to the right-hand column on this chart. First quarter 2015 revenues are forecast to be up 4% to 5% on a reported basis, and you can see currency and acquisition impact on the slide. Reported first quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $0.26 to $0.30. The inventory step-up all hits in the first and second quarters and impacts first quarter by $0.03. Adding this back to get to an adjusted basis, the EPS range is $0.29 to $0.33. And it seemed this morning there are some questions about first quarter guidance, so let me give you some more color now in order to address that. At the midpoint, first quarter is about 8% of the total year adjusted earnings. And historically, it would be closer to 9% or 10%. So slightly less than normal.  There are few things impacting the first quarter. First, as a portion of the full year, Cameron's earnings are less in the first quarter due to the calendarization of their revenues. Second, benefit costs are higher in the first quarter than historical due to the timing of the costs incurred relative to our health care programs and equity compensation grants. Specifically, this year in the U.S. for the first time, our employees are all participating in health savings accounts with their health care program. So employees earn credits through [ph] health care savings accounts through doing certain activities related to wellness. Those fund at the beginning of the year, but we'll see a benefit to us in the year from lower health care costs as we go along. Third, we'll get more benefit later in the year from lower copper because of our layering strategy. We entered the year with copper locked at about 70% for the first half. So copper movements won't have much impact in the first part of the year. And then finally, foreign exchange, of course, is more negative versus prior year in the first quarter given the variance of rates from a year ago. So we provided EPS bridges for both first quarter and full year in the appendix, and that will help you view the walk from year-to-year.  For the full year 2015, we expect to generate free cash flow of $950 million to $1 billion, which is at our long-term target of 100% of net income. We intend to increase the dividends as appropriate to be consistent with the payout ratio in the peer range. We expect Frigoblock to close in the first half of this year, and we'll utilize EUR 100 million of cash to do that.  We anticipate a minimum of $250 million of spending for share repurchase, which will offset dilution from equity issuances. And that will leave us about $350 million of cash that we see as a toggle between value-accretive acquisitions and share repurchase. We have a pipeline of acquisition opportunities related to our core business, and we weigh those risk-adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value.  So in closing, we're pleased to have delivered another solid year with 2014 margin improvement and earnings growth ahead of our targets. Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multiyear trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. Our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementation of those strategies. We have proactively worked to deliver productivity and make prudent investments for the future. Our new product line is as strong as it has been in decades. If any of you were at the AHR show this week, you saw a clear evidence of that. We continue invest in new product and service offerings, our IT infrastructure and systems and by further developing our people and our operating capabilities. We continue to execute a consistent, value-maximizing capital allocation program. So I'm proud of the progress that we've made, the results we have delivered and believe that we are well-positioned as we enter 2015 and for future.  And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Mike, you talked a little bit about the differences between institutional and commercial and in some of the momentum you're seeing in K-12. Can you put that in terms of applied versus unitary for the year? I guess, maybe starting off with what bookings were for each in the quarter and then how you're thinking about the difference between the 2 businesses. Michael Lamach : Well, the unitary markets globally worldwide and in North America were very strong, low double-digit teens type growth there. So we're seeing that in commercial, industrial. And obviously, some of that's happening in smaller institutional projects where unitary would be applied. You might see more unitary in sort of the lower schools, K through 6, maybe some smaller middle schools. You'll tend to see in bigger high schools, perhaps more applied. So it was a time on the mix of K-12 that happens. But we've worked hard over the last 5-plus years that we've got relative parity in margins between the applied and unitary, and we've got good utilization and capacity left for whatever that mix would swing. So I think that from a company point of view, we feel good about the contribution margin of applied or unitary, and we feel good about the capacity upside that we've got in our facilities to build out at -- if we were potentially surprised by better markets, we would have the ability to work against that -- execute against that. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Do you think the unitary still outpaces applied in 2015? Michael Lamach : Yes, I do. I actually do. I think that applied, you probably look at something more like a mid-single-digit growth rate. I do think that, that will sustain itself over a multiyear period. If you just look at what's required from an institutional infrastructure perspective, it would make sense that, that would be the case. So as you get further out into that multiyear view, you may see a mix change where unitary comes back into a more normalized, low to mid-single-digit type growth pattern that it could sustain that way for a while. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Andrew Casey : In the quarter, it looked like productivity benefit really accelerated versus last quarter, and it was against a little bit easier comp, but that doesn't, by itself, explain it. Could you give a little bit more detail on what drove that and kind of what you expect going forward? Susan Carter : So Andy, when you think about what happened in the fourth quarter overall, first of all, we talked about that the revenue side was up and the revenues that came through were good revenues that provided some additional leverage. And when you look at the pieces of the business, we got some good productivity out of our cost base. We got some good productivity out of the direct material inflation and from some of our other components of cost, whether it be something like warranty or other items. So really, when you take and you look in the quarter and all of the pieces, everything was just better than the way that we had looked at it. Because people in our businesses did a great job of not only executing on the revenue side, but they also did a great job of executing on the cost side, which, like I say, across the board in all of the different categories, gave us additional productivity. So there's not really one big thing that you can look at, but... Michael Lamach : Andy, one thing maybe to emphasize Sue's point is we would look normally at every quarter on a really detailed risk and opportunity assessment in the quarter, and we'll update that through the last minute of the quarter end. And it was a case -- and I want to say hats off to the team, the whole team, sort of the business team and functional team, because it was a function of executing all the opportunities and managing all the risks in a way where you get the best net out of that that's possible, and it's just like that. Andrew Casey : Okay. And just a quick follow-up on that. So based on your description of a lot of things going right, it seems like that should be sustainable at least for the short term. Is that accurate? Michael Lamach : Andy, I always say that you have to leave room for breakage, okay? I mean, that was a perfect quarter for us. Most companies, when they tell you, or they don't tell you, things aren't perfect. You allow room for breakage. So we'll continue to look at things on a risk-adjusted basis, and I would suggest that that's pretty good leverage that we have in the quarter. And I dial you back on something that looks a lot more like the gross margin of the business for us, okay, because that's over a very long period of time, which is what we've done over 5 years and going multiyears into the future. If you're able to leverage that at your gross margins, it's phenomenal, it means there's no fixed cost investment, very hard to sustain. Lean is a key part of doing that, but that would be a fantastic 10-year sort of view. That's the essence of the operating system that we're building as we have had 5 good years of that. We'd like to have least 5 more before we call that something sustainable. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : So just -- maybe just to -- obviously, conversations are on closing Cameron. And maybe just -- if you can talk, Mike, about sensitivity of Cameron to the oil price and how the operating plans for Cameron has changed, if at all, since you announced the deal. Michael Lamach : So Nigel, I will get Sue to give you a first crack at that. She's been very close, very, very close to that team and particularly with sensitivity of oil and gas. Susan Carter : All right. So Nigel, the way that I would start looking at that piece of the business is you divide it really into sort of 4 almost equal categories or pieces of the business. So you've got the engineered air piece of the business, which is largely the air separation and pieces; you've got the plant air piece. Those 2 pieces -- so again, let's call each of the pieces 25% of the business for the sake of argument. Those 2 pieces of the business are really going to flex with just the ITR industrial indices. So those are not going to be as exposed. You've got the processed gas piece of the business again, and another 25% of the business, and that has some exposure that comes to the oil and gas side. But that piece of the business is going to look at a lot of things that are hydrocarbon. So while you have an impact from the oil and gas pricing, you also have the piece that says that there's some just power generation. So conversion from, say, a coal to a lower natural gas price, which is a good thing and something that, around the globe, that business has sold product into, which is not necessarily seeing as much impact; as well as petrochemicals which have been strong. So that's another 25% of the business, and then, of course, the other side is the aftermarket. So again, when you think about the business, the exposure directly to oil and gas is really in that one piece, but it's not the entire piece of the business, and it's not just a negative. And one of the things that you had asked, Nigel, was impacts since we actually signed up the transaction. And so what we'll see, if you recall the commentary when we bought the business, was that this is the long-lead bookings for the business. So the things that you booked in one year are going to sell the next year. We saw some lighter bookings in the back half of 2014 before we actually started operating the business. So we'll expect that some of the lightness that we talked about is more in the back half. Mike talked about in his commentary that their first quarter revenues were light. That's part of the normal cycle; that isn't anything to do the markets or how we're seeing the business. So like I say, not a lot of oil and gas exposure. And truthfully, let me expand that out just a little bit and talk about the total company because that may be another question that you might have is for the total company. I would say you could estimate the oil and gas piece to maybe 2% of revenues, something in that range. So I think we're on solid footing with the Cameron business. We're looking at the synergies. We think we're going to continue to do a really good job of executing those. And the fourth piece of the business that I didn't mention was the aftermarket piece and the service piece, which is our intention to grow. Nigel Coe : That was really helpful. I mean, we've been definitely thinking, you're more of a winner than a loser from the low oil price. And then just a follow-on on -- the investor spending was a hurt to Industrial margins in '14. And I'm wondering, what is the investment outlook for '15 overall for Ingersoll Rand? What sort of rate has that grown at? And to what extent did some investment spending get pull forward into '14? Susan Carter : So again, Nigel, when I think about the investment spending and I think about 2015, so our incremental spending is going to be up on a year-over-year basis. It goes from something like $64 million up to sort of an $82 million number with the investments for 2015. And so here's how I would look at those actual investments is when we start to look at them and we look at where we're investing money, so about 50% of the investment dollars in 2015 are going to be in product and product-related type of areas. So -- and that would include any go-to-market type of pieces out of the investment spend. And then you're going to have the other pieces, which are going to be the business operating systems, so call that another 25% and then the IT systems. And so when you think about sort of that breakdown and think about it in terms of our overall strategy, we want to continue to grow the investments in our product and how we go to market with the product. We certainly want to continue to invest in the business operating system per the strategy, and those things are really paying off for us. So we think that those numbers in 2015 are good investments and something that is really going to be helpful for us. Michael Lamach : Nigel, maybe to add, the remaining piece was the IT systems and infrastructure piece, and we did the beef up some of infrastructure piece particularly as it relates to the security and some -- and making sure that we're doing that. And largely from a headquarters\u2019 basis, it's the best way to spend that as opposed to every business unit making a different decision about that. So that's the source of the other piece of the investment. We'd probably flatten out here from an IT perspective through about 2018, and then we begin to sort of roll off a lot of that depreciation in 2019. So that piece of it, as Sue mentioned, I think kind of flattens out here in 2015. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : My first question is on price/cost. Mike, we did go to the AHR show earlier this week, and it seems like you're getting really good pricing on your commercial HVAC products with all the new products that you auctioned. And clearly, there is a cost tailwind as well this year. And so I'm just trying to understand what's embedded in your guidance in terms of the price/cost tailwind that you should see in 2015. Susan Carter : So Joe, let me try that one on and then Mike can add some color if he chooses at the end. So the way that I would think about our pricing versus the direct material inflation, which is how we talk about it, is we look to have a positive spread in sort of the 20 to 30 basis point revenue. So it looks a lot like 2014. So we've built that capability in, in the pricing with our ability to anticipate and react. So we're focused on maintaining net spread regardless of sort of what's happening on the commodity side. Now having said that, we're fully aware that copper has come down in price. Now the impact to an Ingersoll Rand based on the way that we buy copper is really going to be more in the back half of the year. So we go into the front half of the year being -- we've bought 70% of the copper that we're going to buy. So you're not going to have a direct impact in the earlier part of the year based on that commodity spend. And then we also have exposure on the aluminum and the steel side, which are more in the flattish. So overall, in 2015, again, you've got the piece that you know of with the benefit coming out of copper, but we still think that, in total, direct material is going to be a slight headwind for us. And again, we think we're going to have pricing that's 20 to 30 basis points above that direct material inflation overall. Michael Lamach : Joe, so that spread is an important concept there because we look at scenarios that are kind of 40 basis points of deflation, 40 of inflation. I would lean more towards the deflationary story than inflationary story. But again, I was just really testing ourselves around the ability to react on the spread. The only place where it's been difficult in the quarter for us was really China, where you've got just a lot of mainly local competitors, pricing lower on anticipated cost. And so that was one the place where we didn't catch up with ourselves, but -- and actually, it was quite close. It wasn't like we really missed it out there. So I think net-net, 20-, 30-basis-points positive spread, pick your number on inflation, and that's what we would hope to do during the year. Joseph Ritchie : That's really helpful color, guys. And I guess, maybe my one follow-up question here is really on the applied markets. Mike, you mentioned earlier that your expectation is below where Dodge is for '15. And when I take a look at your order trends for this quarter, it looked like you declined. So I'm just curious like what are you seeing in that market today? What gives you the confidence that we will get some growth as we head into '15? Because it does look like municipal spending has gotten better. I'm just curious to hear what you're thinking. Michael Lamach : Well, actually, total applied were actually up in bookings a little bit in the quarter low single digits, but they were up. And then as we're talking to our people around the globe and we have the ability, of course, to see further a little bit out with pipeline that we would look at in our sales pipeline. And that's more positive, reflecting some of the K-12 activity that I mentioned, which I think that will translate into bookings in the year. Being that K-12 school is generally a little bit smaller and typically have a lot of activity between April and September, a possibility there that we would see some of that come through toward the middle or early fall in the year and that would be a good indication for us that we're seeing momentum there. Our view about being a little bit lighter than Dodge has been our view now for a long time, but particularly in the last year around how institutional recovery would really take shape. And it has a lot to do with industry capacity of tradespeople, about how funding flows through to municipalities and states and just the ability to construct as much infrastructure. Frankly, it's not going to snap back at that double-digit-rate. It's our belief that you'll see a more sustained mid-single-digit curve going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just a question on the Industrial guidance because your sales and margins have been flat there for about 4 years. Your guidance today for '15, you've got a decent organic growth rate of 4% to 5% dialed in. And I also think you're looking at, what, close to 40% incremental margins on the incremental business x Cameron. So maybe talk a bit about the confidence on the organic growth step-up. I see you had one good quarter of orders and also why the incrementals underlying suddenly take off. Susan Carter : So Julian, when we think about Industrial and what's happening in those markets, you're right. As we look at 2015, we've got the revenue grows -- growth and on the legacy business where we're looking at that 40% leverage in 2015. We think that the business has got a good line of sight to the market's, to the orders that they were expecting. They've all been their honing their strategies. And again, if you think about what we were doing with the reorganization of the business and going to a business unit structure and focusing on growth, that gives us a lot of confidence that we've got people that are looking at the right things in terms of their products and their revenue growth. They've also been looking and prioritizing some really good payback investments that support the growth. Those include product development, service infrastructure investments for the business and other channel investments. And so when you look at 2015, they're a larger percentage of the investment spend than they are of our revenue profile, but we think that those are -- we think that those are the right things for those businesses to be doing. And so what we think is as you put all of those pieces together with the team is focused on the businesses and growth focused on remaining these focus on remaining markets and the focus on investments to really grow those businesses, that's what gives us confidence that the business will have the 2015 that we're projecting. Michael Lamach : Julian, I have to say mechanically too, Club Car last year lost 10 days on an ice storm, and about 10 days it had some system issues that were knock-on effects really right after that. So you don't have that repeating. And so just by having a more normal, low single-digit Club Car business, leveraging at really good margins, which you normally would do, plus not having to repeat last year, let's hope, okay, ice storm again. It happened in February, so let's hope that we don't get one down there again. That ought to snap back even mechanically much better just due to that alone. Julian Mitchell : And then my follow-up would just be on the Climate's adjusted operating margin. It looks like you are hitting the margin target there 1 year early, assuming you hit the guidance. So looking beyond that, given you are running at such a good rate, where are you targeting sort of medium term the margins in Climate can get to, assuming no major gyration in organic sales outlook? Michael Lamach : Yes, Julian, if you recall, our structural view was something in the 14% to 16% range for the Climate business. And so I think clearly, we think there's structural opportunity up into that area. So let's work on that probably next. But we're a ways away from that at this point in time, and I think that they're going to continue to see that. But again, it takes investment -- we're investing heavily into product channel, service footprint all around a long-term view that, that's really the structural opportunity in the business. We're going to update that in May, talk about it at that point in time, but we're really pleased to be where we are at this point. It's great execution by the entire global team, both resi and commercial and the service business. So all cylinders fired there early. Operator : Our your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : I'm wondering about your comments about building a little bit of inventory in 2015, and I guess I'm just curious, you're thinking behind that. What areas would that be? And what gives you confidence that, that's sort of a helpful strategy? Michael Lamach : What we saw in some of the higher-margin businesses last year was order volatility that could literally be 200% of sort of at historical rates. And so the market volatility that we're seeing in the world is translating into order volatility on stock and semi-assembled product. And we want to make sure is that when that stuff is very quick-turn, somewhat discretionary in terms of you've got the product, you're going to sell it. We don't want to be stingy on that. We want to make sure that we protect it against the possibility of that sort of volatility. And so widening out the con bonds, widening out the stock rates. And we think about there are certain products in the company that we say it's a 0 stock-out product. Literally, we want 100.0% of the time, you want product, you get the product right when you want it. And we really like that when those products -- the contribution is accretive to the overall margins of the company. So margin-accretive to the company is overall margin profile, stock, semi-stock. We want to have product when you want to buy it. And there's no point, with cost of capital being what it is, to be too stingy about that. So it's just straight economics. Stephen Volkmann : And then maybe a quick follow-up. Are there any share changes in any of your product lines that you'd like to call out for us? And I guess, Thermo King continues to look pretty good. And sort of in that vein, are you worried at all about a competition in the compressor business with your competitor having kind of a euro cost base? Michael Lamach : Yes, if you've listened to me for long enough, I don't talk about sort of market share one way or the other much because I think that over the long run, if you're growing margins and your growth rate is higher than your peer set, you must be doing a good job. Our approach is to be top-quartile every single year around incremental margins and organic growth. That's what we've done over the last 5 years on margins and last couple, 3 years on our organic growth profile of the company. So that's our formula. And I can tell you that we feel like the investment in product and service is working. And I feel like skewing more of that toward the compressed air side of our business, the tool side of our business and the fluid side of our business on a pro rata, Sue mentioned that, is good for us as well. We see good growth opportunities. We see some pockets of growth and some niche opportunities for the product that we've assessed. So we've done a lot of strategic analytics behind the scenes to support that. So we feel good about that. We're going to poke into those areas. So compressed air, tools, fluids are all big ideas that we've got to kind of grow that disproportionately. The product growth teams around the company, you've heard me talk about that, we've doubled those in 2015. We got outsized growth in share and margin performance in those last years for the 6 that we had and feel like we've got the capacity to take on and do 6 more for it's 12 in total. I'm excited about that going into 2015, eventually really having that match the value stream of the company. In fact, all of those product growth teams are actually value streams in the company anyway. So that was a prerequisite for selecting those. So this is, sort of the next 5 years looking out, I think a really good model to grow the company and focus our strategy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : I have one question in 2 parts. On the commodities side, first of all, what are you assuming on price? Was price realization kind of the majority of the 20 basis points this year? Is that the same thing you're assuming on price? And then assuming all other commodities like steel and aluminum are a wash and you just marked copper to where it is today, you said plus-minus 40 basis points, I'm not sure what you were saying, but we know it's been not going to be -- probably not going to be a drag. So what would copper be? Michael Lamach : Steve, my comment on the 40 basis points was rather than trying to be so precise in our ability to predict fluctuations in commodities, we've brought in cases to synthesize ourselves toward how quickly can we respond and react by business in different inflationary, deflationary environments and could we sustain 20, 30 basis points of improvement. A big part of that, though, is not just relationship between the cost of commodity and pricing of the current product. It's making sure that there is an economic value estimation of new product that better value prices what it's replacing. And where there's an opportunity to grow margins on the top line relative to that economic value created, that's a big idea. Obviously, that's where we're doing fairly well at this level. So the introduction of new products for us is an enormous opportunity to raise the margin profile of the company even if we were to hold commodity and pricing flat on the legacy product, which is not our goal, of course. It's to get price there, too. But net all that out, that's how we come back to 20, 30 basis point positive for us on multiple scenarios. C. Stephen Tusa : So basically, what you're saying is that you are going to use some of the commodity tailwind to drive -- to kind of get these new products out there? Michael Lamach : Different thing. The commodity tailwind largely is going to be reflected in competitive pricing at some point in time. And so that's going to take its own, I think, competitive dynamics into consideration. New products that we're launching, when you look at the -- as an example, the energy efficiency or the reliability of product or the total cost of ownership or other serviceability factors that could translate into a value to the customer, that's not something that you see a cost for. You see a margin pricing opportunity. That's the kind of thing that we absolutely want to make sure that we're doing a good job understanding that as we launch products. So there are 2 different thoughts that both show up in the pricing column. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Michael Lamach : I just want to make sure that -- I want to give Steve another crack here to make sure that we got his question. So if you could just make sure, Steve, if you could tell us we got it, I'll give you one more crack at it if we didn't. If not, well, I will go on. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. David Raso : My question is on Thermo King for 2015. You mentioned mid-single-digit growth in North America as a target. Is there a notable slowdown that you're looking for in the outquarters? I'm just trying to understand. At least the industry data seems to be far stronger than that. So I'm just trying to understand how to read that guidance. Michael Lamach : So we're coming off a peak data, and I think that as we look at even some of the changes that have made in terms of driver stops and the ability to create additional driver capacity through a decent number of mandatory stops, helps to create and unlock a little bit of capacity to our customers. Well, that being said, you're coming really off the peak, and so again, lapping -- the new product lapping the old product. It's not that big sort of revenue price differential that we're going to get. Lapping now this year to last year, we'll get some but not much. But early in the year, and again, this is an early read on the full year, you tend to lock in orders early or at least lock in customer intent. And there's a lot of sensitivity to marketing and capacity for these customers. So throughout the year, those intended order rates may change. So that, in particular, David, is a good reason for us to update guidance in April and in July because that number can move around. But right now, that really is our best guess. David Raso : But just so I'm clear, is your current backlog or order trends up that modestly? Michael Lamach : Backlog is up a little bit higher than that. Order trends are okay. Europe is slow. So it supports the forecast that we've got. David Raso : Okay. Real quick, just a clarification. When you spoke of 40% leverage on organic, that was pre-investment, just so I'm clear. Is that correct, pre-investment? Michael Lamach : Is that the 40% organic on industrial? David Raso : I think -- I thought it was a total company comment, making sure I understand the organic leverage comment. Michael Lamach : Yes. Janet Pfeffer : Yes, David, this is Janet. It's just basically taking the -- taking Cameron out. It's kind of legacy parts of Ingersoll Rand. David Raso : But it includes the incremental investments for this year? Janet Pfeffer : What? David Raso : It includes the investments figure for this year? Janet Pfeffer : Yes. David Raso : It does. Okay. Michael Lamach : Your note actually this morning, you're correct. I mean, you're bringing all of Cameron in this year at the beginning of the year. So the math is a little bit different. The true incrementals of the company are closer to 40%, and then Cameron is towards [ph] that, okay, in the 1 year. David Raso : Well, I guess, I have it then. The currency drag, what are you assuming on decremental? To be fair, if you're looking for the whole company to have about $145 million of EBIT growth, if you put 40% on organic, I'm already up at $230 million. So how much is the currency drag? I mean, I run the numbers on how you imply $0.17, and it looked that quite the drag is only $60 million. Janet Pfeffer : David, this is Janet again. I think you're misunderstanding how we use our -- legacy is the right word. It's a legacy company. So that is... David Raso : So it must be x investments? Janet Pfeffer : [indiscernible] is offset by FX. David Raso : But it must be x investments then. Is that what you're saying? Janet Pfeffer : No, it's all-in. [indiscernible]... David Raso : We'll do the math offline. I'm just saying you've got $230 million of EBIT growth just from organic growth at a 40% incremental, and the EPS comment on currency would suggest currency drag -- again, the currency decremental must be rather significant. Janet Pfeffer : David, why don't you give Joe or I a call? And we'll take from there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Just 2 quick ones. Just back to Cameron, it looks like your guide would imply Cameron revenues are something like $360 million for 2015, kind of a 12% off -- to your Industrial base. So that's down 10% or so from what the 2013 revenues were described as. I don't know if that was just some kind of round numbers in the mix there. But are you actually looking for the business to be down that much? And maybe just high -- I mean, your Industrial orders actually look pretty good, right? Up 3 in Q3 and up 6 in Q4. What is it about their business that their orders would have been soft in the second half? Michael Lamach : Jeff, when we look about valuing the business since we acquired it, we had given it a 10%, 15% haircut from where it was just based on what we knew then, I'm glad we did, based on what we're seeing. So your math isn't too far off. We're somewhere between $350 million and $360 million in probably how we see that. Susan Carter : Yes, and I think, Jeff, when -- again, as Mike said, your math is right. And when you think about the business being down and we went through all of the different pieces, one of the areas where my assessment is that they've missed on the booking side in the back half of last year was on the normal book-and-bill that goes on in the business. Now what causes that, I don't know, because we weren't in control. But that's something that our team, and as the Cameron team now part of Ingersoll Rand, need to look at for 2015 and really focus on getting that book and bill back in. So I think the issue is it's not a fundamental issue with the business. It's getting it put into our operating system and our management team and focusing on the business and just operating. Michael Lamach : Yes, I think the good news, Jeff, is that we've been really able to kind of go back and look at the EBITDA and EBIT numbers and confirm that we've got a line of sight for how to do it based on the business case we've put together which, to your point, already was haircut 10%, 15% as we did a valuation for it. Jeffrey Sprague : And I just wondering on investment spending. And coming around to that, the comment that it levels out, was that just the IT piece of it? Can you -- I think it was. Can you just give us a view holistically on investment spend when it might kind of, I don't know, normalize the sales growth or something that is not a meaningful P&L headwind? Michael Lamach : So correct on the IT spend, Jeff. We're up -- that's the only one that flattens out. And relative to the business investments, it really depends on the pipeline of ideas, and there's an innovation review that we're conducting all the time. There are bulk generation road maps that we're looking at for the product. And we think we've got a pretty good equation here. And again, if we could continue to get the same incremental margins and growth in the business, we would have no reason to tell you that we're going to ever change the investment profile of what we're doing. Now having said that, we don't know beyond about 18 months because it really does depend on what that bulk duration product plan might look like or what acquisitions look like in terms of the footprint that we'll be bringing onboard to serve channel and footprint which is another -- a big part of investment. So we're going to give it to you 1 year at a time, but what you see kind of here is that we're investing in growth of the company and in the OpEx performance of the company at about the same rate, albeit in larger absolute dollars year to year to year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Winoker : You spent $200 million for shares, $3 million to $4 million-ish in the fourth quarter, but you're holding share count flat, I guess, at $270 million through '15. Maybe just -- and what, generating about $1 billion, you mentioned, of free cash flow. Just give us a sense for why you're guiding in that way for the rest of the year and what you're thinking about capital deployment more broadly then. Susan Carter : So Steve, I think the way that we've gone about it and just modeled for you was if you take that $950 million to $1 billion, maybe 1/3 of it goes to our dividend. We said that we would follow our long-term guidance, which is to, at a minimum, keep the dilution from occurring from option exercises and from programs that -- where things are maturing. And so we gave it to you in those 2 pieces and said the remaining, say, 1/3 of the cash flow that we would toggle between M&A and share repurchases. And so we just broke it up that way so that you would say, \"Okay, here's the minimum that they're going to do.\" And then the other piece, if we have good M&A candidates that follow along with our strategy for that, we would do it. And if not, we would look to return the cash to our shareholders. Michael Lamach : Steve, I think to your question about share count, and I'll bring in the experts here if I get off-track, but we would be issuing shares in the first part of the year equity program, so we're buying back shares in last part of the year. So you're going to see dilution in the first couple of quarters, and then you're going to see us coming back to neutral in the back half of the year. It's just the way it averages the share count for the full year. So if 270 million is an average share count, it's not a beginning, not an ending -- I'm sorry, it's beginning and an ending, but it certainly has extremes of issuing in the first quarter and doing a lot of buybacks toward the fourth quarter. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then, Mike, you talked about risks and opportunities, R and Os before in the fourth quarter and how -- I think you used the word perfect, that was for -- for their performance. Maybe just give us a bigger idea of how the Rs versus Os are? It looked like they're balancing out or what you have to believe? What do you think? What are you most excited about that in that list? And what are you maybe most concerned about it as you think about 2015 results? Michael Lamach : So Steve, our philosophy in giving guidance has always been to give sort of the net R&O that we see for guidance and for the quarter. One of the things that you don't see in our numbers now is we haven't put anything in for Venezuela. It just was noisy for us to forecast that, didn't know what was going to happen. At some point, it probably will happen, and we can just update you when something like that actually happens. You also noticed that we didn't spend much really in restructuring last year. Rather than putting noise around that, if we see something that we need to be doing, we're going to do that and update you on that. But probably, we can manage that within the base that we've got. The rest of the items that show up in here are typically commercial puts and takes, win something, lose something. It's all based on pipelines that have typically 4 levels of commitments, everything from -- we've pretty much got it in the bag to pretty much the competition has got it in the bag. Occasionally, you get a swinger where we'll win one, that's a long shot. We'll lose one that we were -- we should have got. So we net those things out. The operational performance of the company is becoming much more predictable in terms of how we're executing against that. And again, this is a big kudos for the bench strength around the company operationally for getting it done quarter-over-quarter for a long time now and managing through that. Because they have their own unique set of R&Os between suppliers that are having floods and fires and suppliers that were switching out, changing line moves, plant moves and running the day to day. So that's the kind of thing we look at on a, at least, monthly basis. Operator : I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you. Thank you very much, and everybody have a good day. Joe and I will be around for questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Joseph Fimbianti : Thank you, Danielle. Good morning. Welcome to Ingersoll Rand's First Quarter 2015 Conference Call. We released earnings at 7 :00 a.m. this morning and the release is posted on our website. We'll be broadcasting, in addition to this phone call, through our website at ingersollrand.com, where you will find a slide presentation that we'll be using this morning for the call. And this call will also be recorded and archived on our website.  If you would, please go to Slide 2, which is our safe harbor statement. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities laws. Please see our SEC filings for descriptions of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to vary materially from our anticipated results. This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in our financial tables to our news release.  With me this morning on the call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. So if you will please turn to Slide #3, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Michael Lamach : Great. Thank you, Joe. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. In the first quarter, our adjusted earnings per share was $0.38, an increase of 31% versus last year's quarter. We closed 2 acquisitions in the quarter. The acquisition of the Cameron centrifugal compressor division closed on January 1, so results were included for the entire quarter. We also closed the acquisition of FRIGOBLOCK in early March, so that had a very minimal impact in the quarter given that less than 1 month of results were reported. Both integrations are going very well. Cameron compressor achieved our forecast for bookings, revenue and operating income. We are seeing some early traction on cross-selling and synergies, and we expect continued progress for the balance of 2015.  Currency had a significant impact throughout the results. So in our comments today, we will mainly focus on organic growth, which excludes currency and acquisitions, so that you can get a better view of end market trends. In the first quarter, we saw solid organic revenue growth of 8%, led by strength in the U.S. and Europe, particularly in the Climate segment. Order rates remain healthy in the first quarter at 5%, excluding currency and acquisitions.  Adjusted operating margins increased 40 basis points, and increased to 100 basis points excluding the impact of currency, and bringing Cameron results into our financial statements for the first time.  Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.07 above our adjusted EPS guidance midpoint of $0.31. The improvement primarily came from higher-than-expected volume, mainly in North America, and good cost control and execution to our plan. Foreign exchange translation negatively impacted the quarter by about $0.01 compared with guidance, however, this was more than offset by FX gains recorded in other income.  Now Sue will walk you through the first quarter in more detail, and then I'll come back to take you through our outlook. Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. We're very pleased with our performance and our execution in Q1. And as Mike talked about, you're going to see a lot of moving pieces with currency and purchase accounting, and we're trying to provide you with a lot of details to facilitate your understanding of the quarter in both the slides and in our comments. So if you would go to Slide 4.  Orders for the first quarter of 2015 were up 3% on a reported basis and up 7% excluding both -- excluding currency. Orders were up 5%, excluding both FX and acquisitions. Climate orders were up 2% and up 6% excluding currency. Global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digits on a reported basis and by high single digits x currency. Transport orders were up low single digits and up high single digits x currency. Organically, Thermo King had strong order growth in North America and high-teens growth in Europe. Orders in the Industrial segment were up 3% on a reported basis and up 9% excluding currency. Orders for Industrial were up 2% excluding currency and acquisitions. We saw organic orders increase by low single digits in air and industrial products and improve by high single digits in Club Car. If you would go to Slide 5.  Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, first quarter revenues were up 6% versus last year on a reported basis and up 8% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions. Climate revenues increased 6% on a reported basis and 9% x currency. Commercial HVAC was up high single digits and transport revenues were up mid-teens, both x currency. Residential HVAC revenues were up high single digits. Industrial revenues were up 7% on a reported basis, up 13% excluding currency, and up 4% excluding currency and acquisitions. And I'll give you more color on each segment in the next few slides. The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis with and without currency. Excluding currency, revenues were up 10% in the Americas; 22% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, led by strong HVAC performance; and Asia was down 3%. If you back out acquisitions as well as foreign exchange, the primary change is in the Americas, which would be up 8%. Please go to Slide 6.  This chart shows the change in operating margin from first quarter 2014 of 5.7% to first quarter 2015, which was 5.9%. Consistent with prior quarters, this is shown on a reported basis, and we've spiked out the restructuring to get you to adjusted margins as well.  Volume, mix and foreign exchange, collectively, were 40 basis points positive versus prior year. Price was positive but was slightly less than direct material inflation. Pricing was most competitive outside of North America.  Productivity versus other inflation was positive 80 basis points, driven by strong productivity in the quarter. Productivity favorability was in direct materials, G&A and solid execution, including the third phase of our ERP implementation in the first week of April.  Year-over-year investments and other items were 80 basis points. This was the first quarter which included results from Cameron and, as expected, impacted margins by 50 basis points due to inventory step-up and intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 60 basis points of headwind from investments and 30 basis points positive from lower restructuring costs.  In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 12%. Backing out currency and acquisition results, leverage was approximately 20%. Please go to Slide 7.  The Climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the first quarter were $2.2 billion. That is up 6% versus last year on a reported basis and up 9% x currency. Global commercial HVAC orders were up mid-single digits on a reported basis and up high single digits x currency. Organic orders were up in all geographic regions, with notable strength in North America and Europe.  Trane's commercial HVAC first quarter reported revenues were up mid-single digits and up by high single digits x currency. Commercial HVAC equipment revenues and HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were both up high single digits versus prior year x currency. We saw year-over-year gains in both applied and unitary ducted and ductless equipment. Thermo King reported orders were up low single digits and high single digits versus 2014's first quarter x currency [Audio Gap] organic orders increased in all regions except Latin America.  Thermo King reported revenues were up high single digits and up by mid-teens x currency, with strong gains in North America truck and trailer and auxiliary power unit. In Europe, organic revenues were up high single digits.  Residential HVAC revenues were up high single digits, with volume gains in all major residential product categories as well as in light commercial products, which were up low double digits for the quarter. The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 7% in the quarter, 40 basis points higher than first quarter 2014 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by inflation, currency and higher investment spending. Please go to Slide 8.  First quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $729 million, up 7% on a reported basis and up 4% organically, which excludes the Cameron acquisition and currency. Air systems and services, power tools, fluid management and material management organic revenues and orders were both up low single digits versus last year. Organic revenues in North America were up low single digits, while revenues in overseas markets were flat.  Club Car organic revenues in the quarter were up high teens from improved sales of golf cars and utility vehicles. Organic orders were up high single digits versus prior year.  Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 11.9% was slightly down compared with last year as we're in the early days of the Cameron acquisition, including heavy purchase accounting impact and negative currency. For this segment, price offset direct material inflation and productivity offset other inflation in the quarter. We achieved our Q1 plan for the Cameron acquisition and the business will continue to add benefit as we continue the integration process. Industrial's organic operating margin at constant currency was 13.9% for Q1, an increase of 180 basis points over prior year. Please go to Slide 9.  For the first quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.3%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory. This includes some incremental inventory related to the regional standards change in residential HVAC and additionally, we have intentionally increased stock inventory levels of key component assemblies in order to ensure availability of supply as we enter the prime selling season for commercial and residential HVAC product. We had good collections in the quarter, with our days sales outstanding and days payable outstanding both improving over the prior year. Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year given the financing we did last October and the early retirement of the 2015 note. Our cash balance is at normal levels. We expect free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 million to $1 billion.  Before I conclude, you saw that we devalued our assets in Venezuela in the first quarter due to the ongoing decline of the Venezuelan currency. This charge was recorded in other income and expense, and we've adjusted it out of earnings per share given its unusual nature.  And with that, I will turn it back to Mike to take you through our guidance. Michael Lamach : Okay. Great, Sue, thank you. Please go to Slide 10. Overall, our forecast has not changed materially since the last call in January. North American institutional markets were up in the first quarter and we expect to have a positive year, albeit at a more moderate pace than the current Dodge forecast. We also continued to see growth in commercial and industrial buildings and retrofit. Based on this, we expect mid-single-digit growth for 2015 in North American commercial HVAC markets. We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle East HVAC markets in the aggregate to be up low to mid-single digits at constant currency but flat to down after considering currency. We expect North American transport markets to be up mid-single digits in 2015 and European markets to be down, including FX. We expect residential HVAC industry motor-bearing unit shipments for the year to be up low to mid-single digits and revenues should be up mid- to high single digits due to favorable mix.  We expect industrial markets to be up low to mid-single digits. Golf markets are expected to be up low single digits.  Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up 4% to 5% versus 2014. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 3 percentage points, and we expect the Cameron centrifugal business to add 3 points for the year. So for organic growth, excluding foreign exchange, we end up back at the 4% to 5% range.  Translating that to our full year outlook by segment, we expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% excluding currency.  For the Industrial segment, revenues are forecast to be in the range of up 13% to 14% on a reported basis and 4% to 5% excluding Cameron and foreign exchange. Industrial has a higher proportion of revenues outside of the U.S. than Climate, so Industrial experiences more impact from FX as compared to Climate.  For operating margins, we expect Climate margins to be in the range of 12.5% to 13.5%. We expect industrial margins, including Cameron operations and amortization but excluding the impact of the inventory step-up, to be 14.5% to 15.5%. The inventory step-up will be reported in the first and second quarters, it's about $12 million per quarter. Since it's noncash and isolated to those 2 quarters, we felt it was more representative of ongoing earnings to spike out the step-up. If you remove the Cameron impact, the legacy Industrial segment has operating leverage over 50%. Please go to Slide 11.  Transitioning to earnings. Our reported earnings per share guidance range is $3.42 to $3.60. Excluding the Cameron inventory step-up, restructuring and the Venezuelan currency devaluation, the range is $3.66 to $3.81, an increase of 10% to 14% versus 2014. When you exclude the impact of bringing Cameron revenue and earnings in for the year and currency, the legacy company leverage is at approximately 30%, and including acquisitions and currency, we should be in the 25% range. The $0.07 per share outperformance for the first quarter largely offset the additional currency headwind from the strengthening of the dollar against overseas currencies in the quarter. For example, we built our original guidance at a euro rate of USD 1.16 and our current forecast is at USD 1.08.  Just as a reminder, the information we gave you last quarter to give you some simple math to gauge our sensitivity to currency movements, a 1% movement in the euro means about a $0.01 in earnings. If all currencies move 1% versus the dollar, that would be about $0.02 of earnings. To focus on second quarter guidance, see the right-hand column on the chart. Second quarter 2015 revenues are forecast to be up 4% to 5% on a reported basis. You can see the currency and acquisition impact on the slide.  Reported second quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $1.14 to $1.18. The inventory step-up all hits in the first and second quarters and impacts second quarter by $0.03. We also expect about $0.01 of restructuring costs. Adding this back to get to an adjusted basis, the EPS range is then $1.18 to $1.22. We have provided EPS bridges for the second quarter in the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year.  For the full year 2015, we expect to generate free cash flow of $950 million to $1 billion, which is at our long-term target of 100% of net income. We increased the dividend by 16% to be consistent with the payout ratio in the peer range. We also utilized EUR 100 million of cash to pay for FRIGOBLOCK. We anticipate a minimum of $250 million of spending for share repurchase, which will offset dilution from equity issuances. So that leaves about $350 million of cash that will be put to either value-accretive acquisitions or share repurchase.  We have a pipeline of acquisition opportunities related to our core businesses, and we weigh those risk-adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value.  Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multiyear trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. Our focus is to continue to grow earnings cash flow through further implementation of those strategies. We have proactively worked to deliver productivity and make prudent investments for the future. We continue to execute a consistent value-maximizing capital allocation program.  In closing, we've given you a lot of data and analysis on our operations this morning. There are a lot of moving parts for this year's numbers and it's likely to continue as we go through the year. Filtering out all the noise, I hope it's obvious that our overall business fundamentals are strong. Our investments are fueling our revenue growth and our productivity improvements are on plan. Our 2 new acquisitions are on forecast, and we believe we have purchased 2 very sound businesses.  There's still a lot of work to do, but I'm very pleased with our steady operations improvements and the growing maturity in our operations. Proud of the progress we've made, results we've delivered and believe we are well positioned for 2015 as well as for the future. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Danielle, I'll turn it over to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : So just wanted to just kick off first of all with the margin bridge from the slides, and a little bit surprised to see 20 bps impact from price rolls this quarter, especially given the deflation we've seen in raw materials. So I'm just wondering, can you maybe make some commentary on price and why that was negative? Michael Lamach : Yes, Nigel. We had positive price in the quarter. We had a little bit of carryover material inflation just due to some of the assemblies that we're working on. But essentially, the price would come into the Asian market, particularly China, a bit into Latin America, which really in the last quarter or 2, those markets have struggled, and we've got some local competitors, I think, with some capacity to utilize. So that's been a bit more pressure there. We also had a bit of a rebate timing from Q4 to Q1, and if you sort of add that back to Q1 and normalize it, we were pretty close to being flat, which it is 20 basis points less than what we had hoped for, but it was fairly flat. Nigel Coe : Are we still looking for about 20, 30 bps benefit for the full year? Michael Lamach : Yes, we're challenging ourselves to do that. That's -- it's probably one of the challenge points in the forecast. But our plans, the road maps we're building, the countermeasures that we've got to realize price would have us doing about 20, 30 bps of price and material inflation gap. Operator : And your next question comes from Mark Douglass from Longbow Research. Mark Douglass : Is there a little bit of conservatism in guidance on the organic growth expectations? I suppose some of that's because 1Q is really seasonally weak. Don't want to read too much into the year, but your trends seemed pretty good and certainly outpacing the 4% to 5% organic growth expectations. Michael Lamach : Yes, I mean, the optimism in the quarter was the strong growth, but as you pointed out, it's seasonally such an insignificant quarter to the full year for us that we typically go back and fine tune in July, and we'll do that again this year. But your question and Nigel's earlier question, where we might see potentially some upside to volume, mix was not particularly favorable in the quarter for us. Currency is still quite a bit of headwind if you look at the euro at $1.08 and currencies where they are today, it's about $0.11 of headwind. We offset about $0.07 in the first quarter, but we've got more room to work for the balance of the year. And then, again, the pricing question, we've got a more aggressive view around pricing for the balance of the year. So you net it all out, I think it nets out to a balanced view on guidance. But specifically, on your question, if we were to see stronger markets by July, we would probably make a little higher call there at that point in time. Mark Douglass : Okay. And then you mentioned Industrial hits better than 50% incremental margin in the legacy business. Can you describe what's really driving such strong incremental leverage? Susan Carter : Well, I think it goes back to, Mark, what I talked about when I talked about the segment, is that if you -- they have a higher impact from currency, right? So if you take that out, that's a piece of it. And then if you take out the Cameron acquisition that in its early days and it's got all that purchase accounting, the business or the segment itself actually had positive price versus direct material inflation. They actually had productivity that offset inflation and so they actually had a very nice quarter in terms of operational performance that underlie the basics of that. So -- and also investments were in line with the revenue percentage in the first quarter of 2015. So you take out some of that noise that we talked about, they actually leveraged very, very well for the quarter. Michael Lamach : Club Car did a great job, too, doing what we expected against a very easy comp from last year, but Club Car did a nice job in the quarter. Operator : And your next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : A couple of questions. I was hoping you could give some clarity on that whole inventory situation with residential HVAC and the new SEER requirements and has that inventory been sorted out. And then secondly, some commentary on the strength you saw in EMEA that upped 22% x FX. Michael Lamach : Deane, on where we sit with 13 SEER, just for competitive reasons, we're not going to talk much about that. We really don't want to discuss our position at this point in time. The main thing we're trying to do is -- we saw across the business a lot of order volatility starting last summer. And I commented on that in the third and fourth quarter. And frankly, that volatility was broader than even the min-max requirements we would have for stocking key components. And so rather than trying to guess the volatility of the markets, we've expanded those min-maxes for key material, for components and assemblies, particularly in high margin businesses where cycle times were very short and there was some discretionary opportunities with customers that wanted to buy what was on hand. And so we took that up, and I think that's an important point because we're looking at fulfillment rate and cycle times we balance with inventory levels, and the net of that really is strong growth in the quarter and improved customer delivery rate. So I'm not sure where working capital will really end for us exactly, but frankly, if we can continue to get the strong growth, great fulfillment, it's an inexpensive investment in terms of EPS growth for the company. Europe discontinued the HVAC business, but I would also say across all the businesses, it performed very well. The standout was the HVAC business, as it has been for probably more than 1 year now. And it's a combination, I think, of -- it's just the winning combination of having the right management team on the ground, a lot of new product hitting the markets at the right time, and the combination of that, really coming together with some great results. I think they were probably north of 20% before currency in that business. Operator : And your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Mike, could you give us a little more color on what's going on in the institutional markets, institutional applied in particular? And it does sound like commercial unitary was robust also. Is there any particular verticals there that are standing out? Michael Lamach : The interesting -- Dodge is calling for an 11% increase in institutional. It's about still 25% off its peak. And we've contended that you're more likely to see an extended sort of mid-single-digit institutional recovery perhaps over 2 or 3 years. Education is probably a little better than 5%. Health care is looking at probably a little less than 5%. Those are 2 important markets for us. I commented that we needed to see some education orders moving through the pipeline. We're seeing that, so that's a positive. And we would expect health care, which typically are going to be a bit more complicated, a bit more applied work going in there, applied engineering, applied product going in there, probably late this year, early next year. So that's shaping up. We're seeing strong still commercial and manufacturing construction going on. That vertical, as it relates to HVAC, I'm talking about industrial buildings being built, commercial buildings being built, continues to be strong. But we've had great success with light commercial. That is a product growth team for us. They've done an excellent job. Sue commented that we've seen double-digit growth year-over-year there. So we're very pleased with what's happening across that business. Jeffrey Sprague : And just a quick one for Sue to follow up. So we had FX gains, I guess, in other. Can you just describe what -- where you're at on hedging for the year and kind of what the strategy is and how hedged you might be? Susan Carter : Right. So when -- Jeff, when we think about what goes into the other income and expense and the favorability that you see in Q1, that whole line is going to be a couple of different items, one of which is the foreign exchange that I'll get to. What's also in there is earnings from some of our equity affiliates, some interest income and, as you might expect, the other cats and dogs on the P&L that don't fit in to another line item. In general, that line item is going to be somewhere between $2 million and $6 million favorable. And if you think about looking back to the fourth quarter, it was actually $6 million favorable. So you've got the $10 million in the first quarter, not unheard of. But the big drivers for the first quarter, to answer your question, were better earnings out of our equity affiliates, and then also the foreign exchange gains and losses outside of the Venezuelan currency devaluation. Now what happens with the foreign exchange gains and losses is the only thing that we do cash flow hedging on is our balance sheet position and things that are known to us. So when we put those hedges on, if the dollar is strengthening, when you close out those positions, you get a gain. And that's part of what we saw in the first quarter. It doesn't mean it's repeatable because as you roll those hedges, you're resetting the rates. And if you look at Q1, this is the biggest change quarter-over-quarter in terms of foreign exchange rates, particularly on the euro that would have been an average of $1.33 last year and $1.09 this year. So again, some nice gains that are in there from a transactional point of view. And we try -- there isn't a direct percentage that I would say is hedged, but we're looking at things with the intercompany loans and things that are known that don't have a lot of volatility and risk for those, and that's just a routine for us that we're putting cash flow hedges out for that. Operator : And your next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Robert McCarthy : I just want to talk about the trajectory for the U.S. nonresidential construction in terms of how you're seeing it, in terms of the exit rate, in terms of orders coming into March and April. How are you feeling about the year? And then maybe if we could talk about operating margins throughout the back half. Michael Lamach : I think that a mid-single digit view is a good view. Again, I think that you'll see education maybe a bit of north of 5%, health care a bit less than 5%. We'll still have a good unitary business for office and manufacturing. So really sticking to that kind of mid-single digit. And to your earlier point, if things continue to shape up, maybe it's to the high end of that range, and we'll come back and adjust in July. Robert McCarthy : And just given the cadence for the year and all the noise you're seeing and obviously some of the incremental headwinds with FX, how should we think about the cadence for incremental margins of Climate throughout the back half of the year? Michael Lamach : Well, in general, for the company, I'd start -- you would look at sort of all-in reported about 25%, and if you take out acquisitions, you're probably closer to 30%, the gross margin of the company. Climate would do about the same. Interestingly, when you see translation in our company, obviously, it's going to impact businesses like Industrial will a have higher exposure to foreign currency, which is a higher-margin business than our Climate business. You also find it in the TK, it's one of the global businesses we have. And so obviously, the operating leverage -- or deleverage on currency there is higher coming back in. So it's obviously more difficult to offset translation per se. So we have to drive harder with productivity to be able to do that. And that's the road map that we're building. And so a lot of companies I know have taken down guidance as a result of currency. I thought, a, it was too early in the year for us to do that; and, b, we've had good success with productivities and good volume in the quarter and feel like the leverage should support staying with the range that we've got at this point. Susan Carter : And the other part of that, Robert, is going to be that -- the direct material inflation. We talked about we've got some inflation in the first quarter and a bit in the second quarter, some of that Tier 2 carryover in the back half of the year. We see that, that levels out and we're not getting material inflation, so that also helps the leverage in the back half of the year for, actually, both of the segments. Operator : And your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just a question on the Industrial margins. You've got the target for the year of 14.5% to 15.5%. I just wonder if you think you'll be able to get into that in Q2 or it's really about a big sort of second-half move. Susan Carter : I think that as we look at it, Julian, our projections would say that we're going to continue to grow and that the second quarter will be stronger than the first. So I don't want to not allow for any breakage, but I think we'll start to see things get close to that range in the second quarter for Industrial. And when we think about what's happening there, they're still going to have the big FX impact, they're still going to have the Cameron step-up, but there is productivity and the additional volume that is going to help them. So the short answer to your question is, yes, we should get close to that in the second quarter. Julian Mitchell : So then my second question. Asia revenues organically were down sort of 4 consecutive quarters now. Just maybe give a bit of an update on that. I understand there's been a price war in Chinese HVAC for sort of 6 months or more. And do you think that your Asia business can get back to organic growth in the next 6 months? Michael Lamach : Well, the overall market is down, so it's not actually any sort of a share issue. And it's somewhat choppy. And we've seen this before in China in terms of the choppiness and the shortness of the cycles, that we've had years of 2 quarters down, 2 quarters up, net up, and I think that you're looking at that here. The pipeline there would support a back half of the year which is stronger than the front half of the year. And so even for the second quarter, we're likely to see sort of flat for the overall company, down in terms of bookings. But for Climate, I would expect to see an uptick in Q2, potentially high single digits, maybe even better, if bookings -- timing of bookings comes in as we would expect. And then for the full year, we should have, I think, pretty strong growth there in HVAC. Operator : And your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore. David Raso : My question's on Thermo King. The strength, positive in North America for a while, but seeing some improvement in Europe. Can you flesh that out for us? What are the order growth rates you're seeing in Europe? Just trying to maybe find a little offset to Thermo King is down in '15 domestically, do we have some international offsets? Michael Lamach : Yes, I don't think we've seen the order growth rates really coming back in Europe, although I think there is more optimism, in general, in Europe. And if you take currency out, obviously just look at the market for itself, there's more sort of optimism around Europe. But we didn't really see that in the first quarter. The growth we had in TK there, it was largely North American truck and trailer. But across the world, we would have seen great container growth again. We saw APUs with really strong growth, something near 50% in that regard. Also, air, rail and bus combined were up as well, David. So those businesses are becoming more significant as a total part of the mix at TK. North America's performing about where we thought it would be. Europe hasn't quite recovered, but we think we will a bit toward the end of the year on a constant currency basis. And we expect the ancillary products around rail, bus and APUs and containers to continue to have good growth. Overall, kind of a mid-single-digit view. David Raso : And for this year, at least, Thermo King domestically has a pretty healthy backlog. How far does it extend into? Does it cover now pretty much the majority of the rest of '15? Michael Lamach : We've got a pretty good view at '15. We're slightly less than ACT. Looking at 43,000 units, I think, in the last forecast, and we would be something a bit less than that at this point in time. So where ACT is calling for, say, 10%, we're calling for kind of more of a muted mid-single-digit growth rate there. Again, if there was some optimism, if we chose to view that, hopefully ACT is right. Again, this is where we've got inventory in place in case it is right. That typically could be some longer lead items on diesel engines, and that's one of the positions we took would be a stronger backlog of components in inventory there. Operator : And your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : My first question is on Cam. You've had Cam into the -- in the fold for a quarter. I just wanted to see if you can give us an update on your outlook for that business. And specifically, whether you've seen any pricing pressure, particularly on the oil and gas side of that business. Susan Carter : Let me try to walk you through the business and the different markets that they're participating in. As we told you, they met our revenue and operating income expectations for the first quarter, and we're on track with generating the synergies and doing the things that we are planning to integrate the business. So everything is going along as we would expect with the business at this point in time. If I divide and go into the individual markets for them, processed gas, again, a piece that does have some exposure on the oil and gas side, we're actually seeing some strength in the business with natural gas and with LNG. There's some project delays that are happening in, perhaps, the Middle East. But petrochem is holding up as well as power generation in some of the pieces. So all in all, processed gas is holding up well. Plant air, we're seeing good activity there with the business, and the book-and-turn activity was good in the first quarter. Engineered air, which is the piece that is exposed to air separation and some of those markets, is showing a little bit of a pull back, and that's really more of an across-the-industry type of pull back, particularly in Asia where there was a lot of building and a lot of overcapacity in air separation. And on the aftermarket side, the aftermarket is stable for us. But we, of course, have plans to grow that, as we talked about when we did the acquisition. So all in all, we're seeing what we expected to see out of the businesses. The markets haven't really let us down in any big way. And again, our exposure, being more on the gas side than the oil side of this, are keeping us on track with what the plan was for the business. Joseph Ritchie : That's really helpful. One follow-up, I guess, just on the incremental margins just being slightly lower this quarter for a variety of different reasons, lots of moving parts. It seems given that you've got an expectation that you're going to get a little bit more price/cost leverage as the year progresses, I mean, is it fair to say that as we get into the second half of the year, you should see -- could you see incremental margins that are closer to the type of incrementals that you experienced last year? Michael Lamach : Well, if you go back to the first quarter guidance, we probably did just maybe a point or 2 better in terms of operating leverage than we had guided. So we're pretty close on that. Got there a little bit differently than what we expected : a little bit weaker price, material inflation; a little stronger productivity; a little better volume; a little worse mix. But the bottom line is it was a solid execution to get to the leverage that we had planned. When you look at getting the 25% reported op leverage, a 30% x acquisition op leverage, it would imply a better back half than front half. And I think we're, at this point, all of the productivity pipeline, all the plans we have for price realization are in place, so it's a matter of executing on that. But again, our forecast to be 25% reported, 30% x acquisitions on leverage for the full year. Operator : And your next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Just a question on the acceleration in the Americas HVAC bookings, up to the high single digits. I think it's been a while since we've been there. Does that feel like sort of achieving lift-off to you guys or is there something sort of keeps you in check, whether it's because it's 1Q or something else you're seeing out there that doesn't want to extrapolate that? Michael Lamach : Well, I think we're getting great lift-off from the product growth teams we put in place. And again, I couldn't be more happy with the efforts of that entire team, which is a very broad team of product management, engineers, operational people and the whole selling organization doing a fantastic job with that. So I'm more pleased with the execution of the product growth team than I would be to call it any more than what I have, which is a decent institutional market which, believe me, we're delighted to see after years of negative, it'll be a positive. And I think that the commercial and industrial building and retrofit markets has some legs left as well, too. But again, we're -- all in all, even Dodge would say we're 25% off the peak, so we've got a long way to go. Shannon O'Callaghan: Right. And then just on the M&A versus buyback, with the discretionary cash, maybe just a little more color on what you're seeing out there in terms of the M&A environment, what kind of things you're looking at, sort of which segments or size we might view as possible. Michael Lamach : Well, we've taken the philosophy to -- across all of our businesses to look for the best opportunities. And so I think the filtering that we would do and the balancing that we would do would be at the corporate level. But as it stands right now, we've really got all of our businesses looking for the right tuck-in opportunities that are markets we know well, either channels that we can use to exploit new products and services or the other way around. We've got products that we need a channel for. And so those are the typical acquisitions we're looking for. Obviously, we're trying to balance toward a 15% overall operating margin target for the company, so that pushes us to looking for good businesses where the synergies are clear, and that's a tough threshold obviously to look at out there for us. But look, it's competitive out there in terms of acquisitions still today. A lot of these pipelines take a long time to develop. A lot of these are based on historical relationships, relationships we're building with companies that we would have an interest in. In some cases, they may be partners or suppliers to us in other areas. So it's across-the-board, Shannon, and I wouldn't highlight or isolate one particular interesting business for you. Operator : And your next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Steven Winoker : A couple of questions I'd like you to put a finer point on. The first one is on your material inflation assumptions for the rest of the year. Copper, steel, particularly, seems to me like there's a lot more opportunity than what I'm hearing in your commentary. Can you just help me understand how you're thinking about your raws? Michael Lamach : Yes, copper and steel are moving in the right direction, Steve. We buy a lot more components than assemblies. That is twofold. One is, in some cases, you're paying more for overall general wage inflation or freight inflation in some of those commodities. It's not always just a material commodity decrease as a part of the assembly. But we're working with suppliers to make sure we're getting our fair share of that back, and where that's not happening, we'll clearly resource that to the supplier with a better price point. And that will take some time as well. So I think we're on top of it. We do see sort of a flattish to down overall inflationary environment. And certainly, steel and copper and zinc are factors that are positive in that as well as freight for that matter. Steven Winoker : Okay. I think you'd be in a pretty good negotiating position right now on those. On the other question, the finer point on volume mix. So 8% core growth; and volume mix, 100 basis points of expansion. Mix must have been really bad, or just help me understand the trade-off between those a little bit, given the very, very strong core growth you had. Michael Lamach : Well, Climate grew specifically in HVAC, much of -- sort of it was the largest contributor to the overall absolute in the company, and it was largely equipment. It has a long service tail on that and that takes a while to materialize over time. So look, when you're mixing higher Climate versus Industrial and higher HVAC versus TK, it puts a bit of a challenge into the mix. But that's really the sum of it. Operator : And your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : The -- I think you guys are -- the majority of your inventories are -- what are they? 50% is LIFO, is that right? Susan Carter : Something like that, yes. Michael Lamach : We can let you know, Steve. Susan Carter : Yes. C. Stephen Tusa : Is there a dynamic there on how the raw materials benefits are going to kind of run through given kind of the more pronounced seasonality in your business? That's the first question. And what kind of impact that may have? And then just on the buyback, just remind us where you guys stand on your authorization for the buyback. And do you need a new one to kind of -- if you're going to do more in the back half, do you need a new one? Susan Carter : So let me take the share buyback because that's probably easier than LIFO, but I'll come back to LIFO. We had the $1.5 billion authorization in 2014 and as of the end of the year, we had utilized about half of that. So given the minimum of $250 million that we had said for 2015, that still will carry us through the year. So no problems on the share buyback authorization. On the LIFO side, with prices going down and volumes, there was no impact as I looked at the financials, really, in the first quarter from LIFO, and I wouldn't expect that to change as we go through the latter part of the year, Steve. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay, great. And then one last question just on the non-resi stuff. JCI also out there saying things are pretty positive. I mean, on the institutional front, I believe the Dodge forecasts have gotten a lot better. Maybe if you could -- just for the sales guidance, I mean, it just seems like things are getting better, not worse, out there. How much kind of visibility do you have into the back half of the year now for commercial HVAC? Michael Lamach : Look, I mean, we had great performance in the quarter, revenue; great performance in terms of orders applied. The books are filling up through the fall. Education, a little less applied. Health care, a little bit more applied. So you'd see more of a move up there. Unitary continues strong, Steve. That, I don't think is going to slow down much for the year. So yes, we are optimistic in kind of a mid-single-digit growth rate. Dodge has been optimistic for a long time. And so we've generally used our own pipeline and a triangulation of all the data that we have and have had a fairly accurate estimate over the last, say, 4, 5 years around that. I don't see any reason to change from that. With that being said, look, if there is some sort of a boom we're missing here, once again, it's this sort of component inventory, particularly on the applied side, that we're going to make sure that we're not cutting ourselves too thin in terms of inventory. And we have plenty of capacity. That's not an issue for us at all in the capacity for applied. Operator : And your next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Robert Barry : I wanted to start by just clarifying what the message was on the commodities. I don't want to mince words too much, but I think on the 4Q call, you had talked about commodities still being a modest net headwind for this year and I know, Mike, you just mentioned that being flat to down. So I just wanted to clarify what the bottom line message is there. Michael Lamach : It's so close to flat that I couldn't call it either way, frankly. But it's certainly not going to be, to my mind, much of a headwind, if any headwind, at this point in time. If things continue as they're continuing, it would be a slight tailwind for us. Robert Barry : Okay. So that sounds a little better than what the message was last quarter, which... Michael Lamach : It's also part of why pricing probably isn't as strong, too. Again, it's all about this gap between price and some of the commodities, which drives some of the pricing in the marketplace. Robert Barry : Yes, fair enough. And then I also just wanted to follow up on the answer to a prior question about TK in Europe and clarify the outlook, I think you guided to low single-digit decline in Europe. In the first quarter, you're seeing high single-digit growth, I don't know if one of them is with currency and one is without, but maybe you can clarify that. And if you're seeing high single now and expect low single for the year, does that imply a meaningful deceleration through the year? Any color there would be helpful. Michael Lamach : Yes, European revenues were actually up high single digits organically. If you take FX against that, obviously you get a story, which isn't as rosy. Susan Carter : Yes, yes, the low single digits was with currency. Operator : And our last question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc. Jeffrey Hammond : Mike, you mentioned kind of being more confident in your product groups and the way you're going to market in commercial versus, say, optimism about demand side. Can you just give us a little more color on what they're doing right? What you're excited about from new product or how they're going to market differently that's driving that? Michael Lamach : Well, the market analytics and the segmentation we're doing around some of the customer segments has been really critical, both in understanding about what will grow and why, what competitors are doing, are likely to do, scenario planning around that, economic value estimation of the products we're launching and making sure we're valuing sort of the product versus looking at it on a cost-plus basis. All that really consummating and having an operations team, an engineering team and a product management team having the same goals and objectives. Just as an example, if a plant manager is looking to maximize inventory turns and a product manager is looking to maximize product availability, they're obviously in conflict. When these people all agree on what it that's being the #1 or #2 thing to grow market share and margins, great things happen. We've got those teams totally aligned on how to grow margin and how to grow market share. And if you talk to anybody on that team, no matter sort of what stripe they wear, from ops, engineering, sales or product management, they're going to give you the same exact answer. And that's where the investments are going and they're not going anywhere else. And again, this is why we've got 3, 4x growth in the overall portfolio last year. This is why I'm excited about doubling that this year and ultimately, this is why I'm excited about the next, say, 5 years because we'll build this thing out all the way. People are having great time doing this, they feel like they're winning, and we're going to keep going as fast as we can. Operator : I would now like to turn the conference back to Joe Fimbianti for any further remarks. Joseph Fimbianti : Okay. Thank you, all, very much for this morning.

And with that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Great. Thanks, Janet. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. In the second quarter, we -- our adjusted earnings per share were $1.20. We saw organic revenue growth of 3%, led by strength in the U.S. and European transport and commercial HVAC businesses. Industrial markets were weaker in the quarter, as distributors delayed restocking and some customers deferred purchase decisions. As a result, organic revenue in Industrial was down 4%. Industrial revenue trends started out weak in quarter 2 but strengthened in the last few weeks of the quarter. Not enough to fully recover within the quarter, but giving us some more positive trends going into the second half. Similarly, organic order rates softened in some markets but remained healthy overall in the second quarter at 4%.  Adjusted operating margins were slightly down but increased 50 basis points, excluding the impact of currency and the accounting impact of bringing Cameron and FRIGOBLOCK results into our financial statements for the first year.  Adjusted EPS for the quarter was at our guidance midpoint, but there were some puts and takes, and we did not perform to our expectations in terms of operating leverage and margin. Revenues were approximately $100 million lower than the midpoint of our guidance forecast. On a percentage basis, we were looking for organic growth of 5% to 6% as compared to the actual 3% growth rate for the quarter.  Climate came in right on our revenue outlook, the difference was all in Industrial. For Industrial, organic revenues in Europe were down low single digits, excluding currency. Asia continued to be weak. U.S. seemed to have taken a pause in April and May and showed some signs of stabilization in June. North America was down 6% on an organic basis in Industrial.  The earnings impact of the lower volume was offset by corporate spend controls, lower compensation benefits as well as favorability in other income. We'll talk more about it in the outlook. We're taking aggressive and targeted cost actions where we see volume weakness. U.S. industrial trends improved in June and have continued thus far in July, so we are partially reflecting that stabilization in our outlook. Before I turn it over to Sue to take you through the quarter, we did reach an agreement with the IRS in mid-July to resolve all disputes related to intercompany debt and similar issues for the period 2002 to 2011. The details are in the 8-K we filed a week ago and Sue will take you through that in more detail today. So with that, I'll turn it over to Sue, and then I'll come back to take you through the outlook. Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Before I go into details on the quarter, I wanted to take you through the reported versus adjusted results, given the larger difference due to the impact of the tax agreement. On a reported basis, our continuing EPS was $0.31. To get to adjusted earnings per share, we're making 3 adjustments totaling $0.89, which we think are appropriate given the nature of the items.  First, the tax agreement resulted in a charge to income tax expense equaling $0.84. Second, as we've guided all year, we are adjusting the inventory step-up component of acquisitions. This now includes both Cameron and FRIGOBLOCK, but the great majority is Cameron. In total, that adjustment is $0.04 this quarter.  And finally, we had $0.01 of restructuring in the second quarter. So that's the breakdown of the $0.89 to get you from reported continuing of $0.31 to the adjusted earnings per share of $1.20. Now let's go to Slide 4. Orders for the second quarter of 2015 were up 2% on a reported basis and up 6%, excluding currency. On an organic basis, which excludes both currency and acquisitions, orders were up 4%. Climate orders were up 3% and up 6%, excluding currency. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 1% on a reported basis and up 5%, excluding currency. Organic orders for Industrial were down 1%. We saw organic orders decrease by low single digits in Air and Industrial products and improve by high single digits in Club Car.  Let's go to Slide 5. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, second quarter revenues were up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 3% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions. Climate revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. Industrial revenues were down 1% on a reported basis and down 4% organically. I'll give more color on each segment in the next few slides.  The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis as reported and organic. Organic revenues were up 4% in the Americas, up 3% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, both led by strong HVAC and transport performance, and Asia was down 4%.  Let's go to Slide 6. This chart shows the change in operating margin from second quarter 2014 of 13.1% to second quarter of 2015, which was 12.6% on a reported basis and 13% on an adjusted basis.  Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were a 70 basis point headwind to operating margin versus prior year. Within that, about 40 points was from currency and about 30 points was from volume and mix. Price and direct material inflation contributed 20 basis points to margin, with positive price and very little direct material inflation.  Productivity versus other inflation was positive 90 basis points. Year-over-year investments and other items were 90 basis points. That breaks into 3 pieces. This is the first year in which Cameron is included in results, and as expected, impacted margins by 50 basis points due to inventory step-up and intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 30 basis points of headwind from investments and 10 basis points from higher restructuring costs.  In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 10%. Backing out currency and acquisitions, organic leverage was approximately 30%.  Now let's go to Slide 7. The Climate segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the second quarter were $2.8 billion, that is up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 6%, ex currency. Climate bookings were up 6%, excluding currency. Global HVAC orders, excluding currency, were up high single digits, with growth in all geographic regions, except Latin America, led by double-digit growth in North America. Thermo King orders were down slightly versus 2014 second quarter, excluding currency. Organic orders increased in North America and were down in Europe, Latin America and Asia. Second quarter organic HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits, led by a mid-teens increase in the North America Applied business. Excluding currency, HVAC revenues in North America increased by mid-single digits in the quarter compared with last year and increased by a high single-digit percentage in Europe and Middle East.  The North American residential HVAC market continued an orderly transition to the new regional SEER standards. Weather impacted end market demand in part of the quarter, but we saw positive trends in June, and they've been continuing in July.  HVAC revenues, excluding currency, increased by a mid-single-digit percentage in Latin America, as revenues in Asia were down by a low single-digit percentage in the second quarter compared with last year. Thermo King revenues were up high single digits, ex currency, with strong gains in North America truck trailer and auxiliary power unit. In Europe, organic revenues were up low single digits.  The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 14.4% in the quarter, 20 basis points higher than second quarter of 2014 due to productivity and volume mix, partially offset by other inflation, currency and a higher investment spending.  Now let's go to Slide 8. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $785 million, down 1% on a reported basis and down 4% organically, which excludes the Cameron acquisition and currency. Air systems and services, Power Tools, fluid management and material management organic revenues were down mid-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues in both North America and overseas markets were down mid-single digits.  As Mike noted, order and shipment trends in the U.S. were unfavorable in the first 2 months of the quarter and strengthened in June. But the pushouts in customer requests moved some revenue out of the quarter and impacted results. For the balance of the year, based on the backlog and order trends over the past several weeks, we see some recovery but are reducing our revenue and profit outlook for the second half in Industrial to reflect the lower volume.  At the consolidated level, that volume is essentially offset by an improved volume outlook for Climate. We're also taking appropriate actions to increase productivity in the impacted businesses to mitigate as much of the profit impact as possible. Mike will take you through the entire forecast in a few minutes.  Club Car organic revenues in the quarter were down slightly. Organic orders were up high single digits versus prior year. Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 13.3% was down compared with 16.4% last year. The Cameron acquisition, including known purchase accounting impact and negative currency account for 180 basis points to the decline. The remainder was due to lower volume, inflation and investments, partially offset by price and productivity.  Let's go to Slide 9. Let me take a few minutes to walk you through the agreement with the IRS. On July 17, we signed an agreement with the IRS to resolve all disputes and litigations surrounding the treatment of intercompany debt. The agreement encompasses the years 2002 to 2011. We previously disclosed the IRS had asserted Ingersoll Rand owed approximately $774 million in taxes, plus additional amounts for penalties and interest during the 2002 to 2006 tax years, and the company expected the IRS to raise similar claims for the 2007 to 2011 period.  We believe that this agreement is in the best interest of the company and our shareholders. When final, it will provide greater certainty around the company's tax structure, effective tax rate and financial position going forward and avoids the risk, expense and time commitment inherent with litigation in a complex multiyear matter.  The agreement covers all aspects of the dispute before the U.S. Tax Court, the Appeals Division and the Examination Division of the IRS. Under the agreement, no penalties will apply with regard to any of the tax years 2002 to 2011. The company will pay $230 million in withholding tax, plus interest with respect to the 2002 to 2006 years, and no additional tax will be owed with respect to these intercompany debt and related matters for the years 2007 to 2011. The next step is for the agreement to be reported to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation or the JCT for review. The agreement cannot be finalized until the IRS considers the views, if any, expressed by the JCT about the agreement. In connection with this agreement, we recognized a charge of $227 million to income tax expense in the second quarter of 2015 and expect to have a net cash outflow in the second half of 2015 of approximately $375 million, consisting of the $230 million in tax and $145 million of net interest. We will fund the payment from cash flow and commercial paper.  We've gotten some questions regarding how this will impact our capital allocation for the year and in the future. First, the amount of the payment is manageable within our current leverage target. We expect no impact to our ratings. We still plan to repurchase $250 million of shares in 2015 as we've guided all year. What has changed is that based on the pipeline we currently see, our M&A spend for the second half of 2015 will be pretty minimal. If opportunities emerge over the next few months, we'll evaluate them, but as of today, I don't see much usage of cash for M&A in the back half. You may recall that we had a $350 million placeholder for M&A. That reduction, in essence, funds the majority of the IRS tax payment.  For the future, this does not change our balanced capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in the businesses, paying out a competitive dividend, share repurchase to, at a minimum, offset share creep and value-accretive M&A.  With that, let's go to Slide 10. For the second quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.8%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory. This includes some incremental inventory related to the regional standards change in residential HVAC. We had good collections in the quarter, with our days sales outstanding and our days payable outstanding both improving over the prior year. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have no debt maturities this year. Our cash balance is at normal levels. We continue to expect adjusted free cash flow in 2015 to be in a range of $950 million to $1 billion, which excludes the IRS payment.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through guidance. Michael Lamach : Great. Thank you, Sue. Please go to Slide 11. In the aggregate, our adjusted EPS forecast has not changed since the last update in April. But within the guide, we've made some adjustments based on market and performance trends. Let me walk you through some of the geographic regions. This is probably the best way to give you some color. North America institutional markets continued their recovery in the second quarter, and we are increasing our revenue forecast here. We also continue to see growth in commercial and industrial buildings and retrofit. Based on this, we expect mid- to high single-digit growth for 2015 in North American commercial HVAC markets.  The regional standards change in residential HVAC is going as planned. Monthly trends bounce around based on channel stocking levels and weather. At the end of June, channel inventory levels were at normal levels, and distributors had begun restocking to maintain those levels. We expect motor-bearing unit shipments for the year to be flat to up low single digits.  To round out North America, we expect North American transport markets to be up high single to low double digits for 2015, reflecting good trends in trailer truck and APUs.  North American industrial markets took a pause in the second quarter. Overall, we did see signs of stabilization in June, which continued so far in July in most businesses, but we did bring down the industrial markets' growth outlook for the year based on the trends. This particularly impacted some of our shorter-cycle businesses in Industrial such as small, medium compressors, Power Tools, Material Handling and fluid management. [indiscernible] markets are expected to be up low single digits.  We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to be up low to mid-single digits at constant currency, but flat to down after considering currency. Within those regions, Europe and Middle East have been relatively strong for us, with flat to slightly up expectations in Asia and a decline expected in Latin America. We expect European transport markets to be down, including FX, but up at constant currency. Industrial markets in Europe, Middle East, Latin American and Asia are more challenging, and we expect them to be flat to down for the full year.  Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up 4% to 5% versus 2014. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 3 to 4 percentage points. We expect acquisitions to add 2 to 3 points for the year. So for organic growth, we end up back at the 4% to 5% range. That's unchanged from the prior forecast at the consolidated level. However, we did update the ranges for both segments. Based primarily on a stronger outlook in North American HVAC and transport, we now expect Climate revenues to be up 3% to 4% on a reported basis and 6% to 7%, excluding currency, which is up 4% to 5% than our prior outlook.  In the Industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in a range of up 6% to 7% on a reported basis and organic revenues to be up 1% to 2% versus 4% to 5% in the prior -- from the prior forecast, reflecting softness we saw in the second quarter and continued weakness in overseas markets.  This forecast requires Industrial to have roughly 2% to 2.5% organic growth in the second half versus about flat in the first half. We see a path to that based on the activity that we've seen over the past several weeks and our booked backlog. Also, the Cameron compressor revenue calendarization is heavily skewed to the second half and specifically to the fourth quarter, based on customer delivery dates that are already in the backlog. The orders are in for about 60% of Cameron's -- I'm sorry, take that back, 60% of Cameron's revenues are in the back half, and we're focused on the operational execution and coordination and requirements of customers needed to deliver on that schedule for those units.  For operating margins, we expect Climate to be in a range of up -- of 13%, which was the midpoint of our prior guidance. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be at approximately 14%. That's about 1 point lower than our prior guide, which is a range of 14.5% to 15.5%. Slower industrial markets, particularly in some of our shorter-cycle businesses in North America, Asia and Latin America, geographies and markets where we generate higher-than-average margins, put pressure on those margin targets. And despite aggressive cost actions in the impacted areas, we cannot see a path to the prior range. This does not change our long-term view in the margin potential of the business. But given the demand environment, we're accelerating productivity and actions to help mitigate the impact from lower volume. Please go to Slide 12. Transitioning to earnings, our adjusted earnings per share guidance range is unchanged at $3.66 to $3.81, an increase of 10% to 14% versus 2014. That excludes acquisition inventory step-up, restructuring, the Venezuelan currency devaluation and the IRS agreement. If you include those items, the range for reported EPS is $2.59 to $2.74.  We are reconfirming our adjusted EPS range. The forecast for the second half of the year reflects some pluses and minuses versus our prior outlook, which about netted, reflects lower material inflation, in fact, it's actually deflation in the second half versus first half and higher levels of productivity from cost control and reduction actions, as well as prioritization of higher-return productivity projects, particularly in the businesses where we have seen some weaker end market trends.  We plan to fully use the top end of the restructuring range of $0.05 that we had guided for the year. In parallel, we're evaluating additional actions, and we'll trigger those if needed to further adjust the cost base to market conditions.  To focus on the third quarter guidance, so the right-hand column on the chart, third quarter 2015 revenues are forecast to be up 4% to 5% on a reported basis and 5% to 6% on an organic basis. That compares to an organic growth of 3% in the second quarter. The higher growth rate comes from several areas : restocking in the res HVAC business, which we are seeing in order rates thus far in July and correlates with channel inventory levels; delivery of scheduled backlog in the longer-cycle businesses such as Applied HVAC and centrifugal air compressors; some recovery in certain of the shorter-cycle Industrial businesses such as Club Car, smaller compressors and fluid management parts. And at this point, we see an improving order rate from the low activity in April, May continuing through July.  Reported third quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $1.13 to $1.17. We expect about $0.02 of restructuring costs. And then adding this back to get to an adjusted basis, the adjusted EPS range is $1.15 to $1.19. We've provided EPS bridges for the third quarter in the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year.  I'd conclude by reiterating that although we met the midpoint of our earnings guidance in the second quarter, we didn't perform to our own expectations and potential in terms of operating leverage and margin. We've already taken and we're going to continue to take action to generate the growth in earnings that we've been communicating to you.  Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multiyear trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. They remain the right strategies for the future. So our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementing these strategies.  And now Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Earl, I'll turn it over to you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : So Mike, you sort of answered my first question a little bit in your closing remarks. The 5% to 6% organic for 3Q just feels, on the face, to be a little bit aggressive. But you talked about the swing on residential and talked about the shipments in some of the backlog businesses in the commercial HVAC business. But is there still some, obviously, assumed recovery in the short cycle, I'm just wondering, what's the degree of confidence do you have in that 5% to 6%? And if you had to haircut that number, would you be comfortable assuming some acceleration from the 3% we saw in 2Q? Michael Lamach : Yes, Nigel. And I saw your note this morning, because Q2 and Q3 are fairly flat and so there were some questions about the normal seasonality of the business. But there are a few things that go on here. First, third quarter North American commercial HVAC bookings and Thermo King are going to continue at high levels, and that really underpins the Climate forecast there. We had excellent bookings and growth in second quarter, a lot of that in the schools market, and so I'm pretty confident that we're not going to see weakness at the North American commercial HVAC and TK in the quarter. We also have seen the restocking of the res channel take place in late June and through July and believe it should match results that we had in our direct model, so that goes well. In fact, we had a good quarter in res for Q2, and think that will continue in Q3. China is interesting, because it's a place you wouldn't expect for us to see a lot of growth. But if you go back to the fourth quarter of 2014, we had bookings of about 33% growth in the fourth quarter in China. A lot of that now ships in Q3. And those projects are in markets where -- I'm sorry, those projects are being delivered into the vertical markets that are growing. So we don't see any real risk in delivering those as planned. Now the Industrial segment moves from really negative revenue comparisons in the second quarter to really, a low single-digit rate, and that's based on a couple of things. First, Club Car had a strong June, kind of plus 18%, so that's really a delay, if you will, in Club Car business from Q2 to early Q3, so I think that we'll see that pick up. We're seeing a pickup, an example, June's, our Compressed Air business was up like 22% in bookings, most of that being in small and midsize compressors, which we feel like we'll book in turn. But then as you look at late Q3, and I know this goes now into Q4, this is where we get into just delivering on the backlog of large machines, whether they're Cameron or Ingersoll Rand. So I think that it's a little bit maybe unusual from a seasonal pattern for us, but I think all the pieces make sense that we should be able to deliver that.  We have put in place a lot of actions, about compressing the productivity schedule, looking at discretionary spend, looking at investment spend, triggering many things now. And if in fact things get weaker or it doesn't materialize in the top line, we're looking between third and fourth quarter to make sure that we manage the bottom line. So that's probably more than you asked for in your question, but that's the answer. Nigel Coe : No, that's incredibly helpful. And by the way, 3% still isn't too shabby compared to some of your peers. The follow-on would be the headwind from volume mix, the 30 bps this quarter, big swing from the plus 100 last quarter. And it sounds from your comments that that's more of a geographic mix than a product mix. Can you maybe just confirm that? And maybe talk about the big swing that we're seeing Q-to-Q and what's caused that swing? Michael Lamach : The mix, it's a bit of a worst-case mix that we saw. If you step back, it's your higher-margin Industrial segment that is just down everywhere, averaging at the gross margins of the business. Then if you unpack that, you end up with a very disproportionate growth rate and deleverage happening in the highest-margin businesses, which are going to be tools, fluid management and Material Handling. Then if you look at it on a geographic basis, it's particularly weak in Asia and Latin America, which have historically been very good, profitable markets for us. So when you look at that sort of mix challenge, it's squarely into the Industrial segment for us. In essence, Climate did well and offset mix with some extra volume and really hit expectations, both for leverage and top line. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : First, just to follow up on Industrial, Mike, again, if you could, and then a separate question. But in Industrial bookings, that strength does sound quite remarkable, just given kind of the general tone in industrial land out here this earnings season. Can you give a little color on kind of vertical markets where you're actually seeing that level of activity? And then as part of the Industrial outlook, it does look like Cameron is actually coming down quite hard. You mentioned it's typically seasonally back-end loaded. But certainly, on a year-over-year basis, it looks like it was very weak here? Michael Lamach : Jeff, actually Cameron is not as bad as you would think. If you go back to the original idea that we had, we thought that it was a $350 million to $365 million business, where based on that, depending on which side of that you take, worth maybe $15 million to $25-ish million lighter overall, it's really coming across -- heavily coming across the smaller businesses and the smaller compressors, which go into small industrial customers across the board. So it was really sort of a pause in the industrial economy in the U.S., which was quite unexpected. Most of these things are going to be stock products we had built and turn them, and they didn't build -- I'm sorry, they built and didn't turn in the quarter, and so it was pretty tough for that. It's also the business that in June was up 22%, largely in small compressors. We also saw some improvements in the fluid business. I mentioned Club Car was up nearly 20% in June. Haven't seen quite the increase back yet in the tools business, and the Material Handling for us is really our only oil and gas-exposed business, and that continues to be very weak there. So the backlog, as I think about big machines, is at this point in time pretty well in the bag. The catch -- the key for us here is being sure to deliver that. I mentioned that Cameron's business is 40% skewed toward the fourth quarter. And so that is actual customer requests for delivery on big machines. And so it's more of an execution of the backlog question there for the full year. Susan Carter : And Mike -- and Jeff, I think we might have confused you just a tad with one of the slides in terms of Cameron. So let me try to add a little bit of color to what Mike has already said. In the second quarter, there were a miss of revenues in the Cameron business. But it was, perhaps, nearly 10% of the Industrial miss, so it wasn't a big part of that. And some of that was actually revenue that shifted over to the third quarter and the back half of the year. On the slide, where -- on Slide 11, where we talked about organic reported revenues, and we said 2% to 3% for acquisitions and 3% to 4% for FX, our original guidance for the year, as you well know, was that we were going to have about 3% on acquisitions, offset by 3% in FX. This is a little bit of the rounding and puts and takes. I do expect the acquisitions to be right about 3%, and FX may be slightly over 3%, but we won't be at the outer margins of that guidance. So I would say, let's call it back to more of the 3% on acquisitions and maybe just slightly more than that on the FX side. Jeffrey Sprague : That's helpful. And then just on raw materials. Mike, you touched it a little bit as you were wrapping up your concluding comments. But can you give us a little bit more color on how that plays? Obviously, we're in a pretty severe industrial metals deflation right now. Obviously, you've got hedging and other things, but can you give us a little bit of an update on how we think this should play through? How big of an impact do you see in the back half? And do you see that really undermining any way your attempts on the other side, on the pricing environment? Susan Carter : Jeff, let me give that a shot. As we look at commodities, first of all, we've said all year that the commodities would turn to a deflationary environment in the second half of the year. And so if we look at that back half, we've got about 70% of our copper bought and about 40% of our aluminum bought. So that deflationary environment is going to flow through what we've got in the back half, so I don't see a big risk to that. And it does help us, from a first half to second half comparison in terms of materials. Now on the pricing side and what we've talked about with pricing, we consider that we still want to have a positive spread between the direct material inflation and price of about 20 to 30 basis points for the year. And that's where we were in the second quarter, we were roughly about 20 basis points. And so I think the back half material deflation is going to give us some -- a wider -- a little bit wider gap or some more positives there. And we still expect to have some positive price. And the overarch on price and material inflation is that we build our pricing capabilities to get paid for delivering higher value to our customers and to anticipate and react to movements in commodities, and I think that's what we're doing. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Robert Barry : A quick follow-up on the price cost. I think it was down 0.2% in 1Q and up 0.2% in 2Q, so call it neutral for the year. Does that imply that to get to the 20 to 30 for the year, it would kind of be 40 to 60 in the back half? Is that kind of order of magnitude? Susan Carter : I think it'll be in the 20 to 30 range, a little bit higher than that to get us to in our range. And we said 20 to 30 for the full year, so just slightly higher than that. But again, that's really the material coming down. As you know, we had a slight amount of material inflation in the first quarter, very minimal in the second quarter, so that turns deflationary in the back half. Michael Lamach : Yes, I mean, Robert, your rough math works. We fundamentally, as material is coming down fast, price won't come down as fast, and so you get a little bit bigger spread in the back half of the year. And unless something happens with pricing and it just destroys the marketplace, I think that, that would be the case. We would see that, from a commercial perspective, things have been weak in Latin America and Asia for sometime, so I don't see pricing deteriorating further there. So I don't think the risk there is great. So it does support falling commodities, prices sort of moving slower and the spread widening in the back half. Robert Barry : Got you. And then maybe just a follow-up on the productivity actions. If you kind of put aside the price cost on materials, it sounds like those are stepped up. Could you quantify how much kind of incremental productivity you now expect versus what you had been expecting? And maybe in that, you can touch on, in particular, corporate. I think that was expected to be kind of 230 to 235. It looked like it really stepped down in 2Q. How is that tracking? Michael Lamach : Yes, right now, Robert, it's probably 30 basis points more productivity in the back half versus the front half. And then in addition to that, we're really putting together re-forecasts for the balance of the year and re-evaluating any sort of investment spend and timing. Even some of the CapEx, just to kind of go back through that and scrub it for the back half of the year. So we're looking to not only get to 30 basis points second to front half, but really get a bit of a natural hedge built in through some productivity actions being built in to protect the EPS forecast we're giving you. Susan Carter : In the unallocated corporate, Robert, we're taking to sort of 220 to 225 for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : I just wanted a bit more color on what you're seeing in Asia, and China specifically, on the Trane side. I guess your margins in Q2 in Climate may be a little bit less than some people have thought. Was there a mix impact from Asia being down within that? And then maybe just give some color on the bookings you're seeing in Asia now. I think Carryall was down very significantly in Q2. Michael Lamach : Well, any sort of mix in Climate, maybe to start there first, would be that on the res side, we're probably one of the few people that actually mix down to 13 and 14, sort of the more we fill out the channel, the more we fill out the product range, we tend to mix down on it just a little bit there. We also mix down a little bit when you look at European transport. And this is really weakness in Eastern Europe that is kind of pulling down some pretty good results in Western Europe, as an example. So there are minor things happening within that. Latin America has been a really soft market in Climate, a very profitable market for us. There's really no recovery happening in Latin America as we speak, and so those are the mixed drags that you see to Climate at present. Now China, it's not unusual, gosh, I can think about last couple of years, where we get this see-saw happening between strong bookings, weak revenue and so on and so forth. Now granted, it might be weak 2 quarters, strong 2 quarters, but as an example, the fourth quarter bookings we had last year kind of coming through into strong revenue in Q3 and good revenue in Q4. When we look at Q3 bookings in China, and this of course is based on a pipeline of real deals and real projects, we also expect a strong bookings in Q3 and in Q4 for China in the HVAC business. This happens to be some of the vertical markets that we are working in. It would not be surprising to find it to be mid-teens in quarter 3, as an example, in HVAC for bookings. But it's a see-saw there to a certain extent. I think that Industrial in China remains weak. I know that power consumption, as an example, was down 2% in China last quarter. Now compare that to the reported 7% growth in the quarter and you get a difference between what's happening sort of on the ground, where the proxy is power consumption, and what's reported in terms of GDP growth. And obviously, the more you focus on heavy industry, sort of the worse off you're going to be. The more you focus on health care, data centers, food, beverage, pharmaceuticals, probably the better you're going to be in that mix. Julian Mitchell : And then just my follow-up would be, with the IRS thing potentially out of the way, you talked about greater clarity or greater certainty in the release on the future effective tax rate. I just wonder if there could be any mechanism to think about bringing that down a little bit in the long run? Susan Carter : I think we -- Julian, I think we'd keep the range sort of in our 24% to 26% range, with sort of that midpoint at 25%. I don't -- we haven't evaluated anything that would change that from a longer-term rate basis. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just on some of this near-term improvement, Mike, that you've seen in the Industrial business, I get the 22% bookings growth in short-cycle Industrial. I would imagine that, given some of the pushouts you saw in 2Q, that there might be a little bit of a hedge to the second half. Can you help us maybe outline the difference between what the backlog supports, what the orders are telling you and what you're baking in the guidance? So I guess, maybe the long way around there is that, do you have more pushouts baked in? Because I guess from an industrial perspective, this doesn't feel like the type of environment where people are pulling in business. And it does seem like there's still a lot of reliance on those fourth quarter bigger projects still shipping on time? Michael Lamach : Yes, Josh, when you look at, sort of -- if you stand a month in front of the next quarter and look at the visibility typically you have of that business, it might be somewhere between 45% and 60%. The other 40% to 55% really comes through those short-cycle small compressors, tools, fluid management businesses. Club Car, Material Handling and larger compressors tend to add just a bit more visibility in what we're looking at. What's a little bit unusual now as we think about how the Cameron business works, and this is really historical for the profile of Cameron, they're a big back half, big fourth quarter type of company. If you think about their top 5 to 10 customers, their pattern every single year is delivery around that time of the year and so that happens. It's got the benefit of really improving visibility there, and of course, we've always had good visibility on our big machine. So it's a pretty fair forecast kind of looking ahead, because we can see that big machine, we can see the Club Car business to the balance of the year. To a certain extent, you're guessing on the overall economy as it relates to the tools business and some of the small compressor business. So if you had to sort of handicap all of this, there is probably, if you want to net it out further, maybe more upside that could happen on the HVAC businesses, maybe a little bit more weakness on the short-cycle industrials. But at the end of the day, I think we've cut it fairly close and fairly. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got you. And then just a follow-up on maybe the margin end of that on the Industrial side. Can you dimension out maybe what was more of a surprise factor in 2Q on the margin versus what gets better by managing that in real-time? And how that relates to kind of the better backlog outlook? So how much of the problems in Q2 just go away because you're now on top of things and no more surprises versus the revenue uptick? Michael Lamach : Well, let me kind of walk you from 16.4% last year to the 13.3% this quarter, just the big pieces, and you can tell me, so you can have your impression about what you could be more on top of and what you couldn't. The biggest piece of what we saw was volume and mix, which was 210 basis points of the difference. The FX piece was 110 basis points negative and then Cameron at 70 basis points. But that's more mathematical, Cameron, of adding revenue in at small OI and now moving toward the back of the year, where they really over-absorb Q3 and they really absorb Q4 -- over-absorb Q4, so you kind of balance that out. You also end up with investments in Other, which were about 1 point and almost -- I'd say the majority of that is just a legal accrual on an old item. So with -- I mean, the other way back, you had productivity over other inflation of 120 basis points and price over the direct translation, which is 60 basis points, so the good guys around productivity and price, 180 basis points. I don't think the investments in Others is a drag. I think Cameron turns itself around just through absorption in the factories, and then volume and mix is what we've been talking about. You've got to place a bet on some of that, both on short-cycle, high-margin businesses and some geographic spread on that. But all in all, the plans we've taken to address this really are contingencies around if things remain weak. And so I would look for productivity to then significantly be better than other inflation and for price to be -- could still be better than direct translation, in this fast-reducing direct material environment that we're in, with price of material deflating, basically. Operator : Next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Evelyn Chow : This is actually Evelyn Chow for Joe. Maybe just returning a bit to your Climate margin guide, I understand that resi [indiscernible] channel, that impacts mix, but it seems like your second half margin guidance implies kind of a normalization of incrementals. Can you help us think about the puts and takes on margins as it relates to mix, investment spending and other items? Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, leverage in Climate just in the quarter was pretty good. So it was right around 25%. But if you take FRIGOBLOCK out, it was right around 30%. So if you start looking at Q3 and -- correct me, Q4, it starts to look around 30% again. So there's really not much of a difference in the leverage that we're seeing and expecting around the Climate business, even with the res mix. So maybe you want to fine-tune your question if I'm missing a little bit, but we're fairly -- it's fairly flat and linear there. Evelyn Chow : Okay, understood. And then maybe just returning to your comment on China HVAC bookings potentially being up in the mid-teens in the back half. That seems a little bit at odds from what we heard in that region from your competitors. So what's driving the strength in your business? Michael Lamach : It's really not unusual for competitor A to have bookings in one quarter and B bookings in the second quarter. It's just based on what they're working on and the customer order profiles for major projects. We see it all the time. When we're up 15%, 20%, it might look good compared to a competitor, and you flip it around and it may look bad. But all in all, one quarter, 2 quarter differences in the competition are really what we're talking about. There is some difference, though, depending on what competitors you talk about. Clearly, we don't have much of a presence in the res business in China. And so I think we've been helped by that, somewhat insulated by that. And we tend to focus on markets, again, like pharma, health care, electronics, data centers, food and bev, where we've done better. Evelyn Chow : Okay. And then maybe just returning to CAM briefly, could you just provide maybe a little bit more color around what you've seen in the 3 main businesses there this quarter? Susan Carter : It's Sue, Evelyn. Let me look at -- take a look at where we are in the market for the centrifugal compressor business. So first of all, on the processed gas side, we're really more exposed to gas than to oil and gas. So we're seeing a little bit of growth from natural gas and from LNG and particularly in the U.S. In the Middle East, you do have some project delays that are related more to oil prices, but we see petrochemical doing okay. And we expect power generation to grow for the business. On the engineered air side, we're seeing some of the industrial gas business, particularly in Asia, with air separation declining, and that's really due to overcapacity in that area, but where steel demand also had -- has an impact on the engineered air segment. For plant air, we see a slow recovery in North America. So we've got some good markets in auto, in food and beverage, pharma, electric power. So North America is stronger; Europe and Asia are slightly softer in the plant air side. And then, the fourth, really, piece of the Cameron centrifugal compressors is the aftermarket, and the aftermarket is stable. But we still have some more opportunities and synergies to gain on the aftermarket side of that business. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Sorry, I might have missed this. But what did you say about the resi -- how resi kind of ended the quarter and started in July again on your independent distribution channel again. Did you give numbers around that? Michael Lamach : Yes, so let's go back to the beginning. We saw wholly owned up double digits and in the quarter, we had independents down roughly the same, actually down double digits. And then if you look at that and break it apart further, April and May were incredibly strong. First couple of weeks were frankly a little bit slow and then the last couple of weeks of June were record levels of shipments that we have seen, and we're seeing that through July. My guess is that it's going to look a little bit more like the sell-through that we had with wholly owned. Now all that, Steve, gets you to kind of maybe flat to low single-digit, motor-bearing sort of markets for the year. But pretty strong last 4 weeks, 5 weeks. C. Stephen Tusa : So what do you think resi can do in the third quarter, assuming kind of weather is stable, in total, your total resi rev? Michael Lamach : Yes, great question. I mean, best case, you're probably looking at double digits -- low double digits. C. Stephen Tusa : Wow, that's good. And as far as the margin dynamics there. I mean, are you starting to see -- I know you guys redesigned your 14 SEER. What are you seeing on the margin front there? I would assume that's not fully reflected yet because there was clearly some prebuy dynamic in your numbers, so maybe just talk about how you can convert that with the new 14 SEERs? Michael Lamach : Yes, 14 SEER is good, Steve. 13 SEER is what it always has been, and I think that as that really comes out of the market, and I would assume for the most part, it would be out of the market relative to AC units by August at this rate. This is the market. The PT pumps to the market a little bit longer than that, but I think that you see the margins start to look better and mix back up. I think that for the res HVAC business this year for us, you'll see good growth, probably share gain and margin expansion again. So I think that they're playing it right on cue. Good launches coming in the fourth quarter relative to the heating season, those are on track. I think that, that's kind of one more nice sort of arrow that they've got to shoot in the fourth -- third and fourth quarter. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then lastly, just on your '16 margin targets for Industrial. I mean, are those kind of off the table here now? Michael Lamach : No, it's too soon to really tell on this. I think we need to get through and look at the delivery on Cameron for the year, look at the bookings going in. But structurally, nothing changes for me. I just -- before coming out and shooting from the hip, I want to make sure that we've had as much of '15 as we can, look at the bookings and the really big stuff and just make sure that we're giving you a number that we can live with for '16, so it's too early for me to do that. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. Can you buy back stock here? Sorry, last one. Do you have the desire to buy back any stock here in the second half of the year if the stock kind of stays where it is today? Michael Lamach : Yes, we're going to buy it all back that we talked about, so it's $250 million? Susan Carter : Yes, the $250 million. Michael Lamach : Yes, $250 million is what you can expect. Operator : Next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Mike, could you comment on the inventory turn number? I guess it came down from 7 to just over 6? And Climate versus Industrial, what's going on there, a little more detail? Michael Lamach : Yes, Steve. When you end up with sort of getting an air pocket come through and you build inventory and it's sitting a bit, it didn't, particularly in those quick-turning stock businesses, you get caught a little bit sitting there. You also get caught needing to pull some production days out because you've built the inventory and so that even compounds some of the margin problems you see when you've over-built. So we've got to work that out in Q3. And then you're going to see, obviously, the res business start to really move inventory levels down as you've got the independent restocking taking place in late June or early July. So there'd be no question in my mind that by the end of the year, that we'd have turns in the right place at that point. And then the teams are working on very detailed plans that -- taken out, month-by-month on a glide path, certainly by December, and we're doing our best to pull it forward into the third quarter, just to have a better chance to build and collect it in the fourth quarter. Steven Winoker : Okay. And that's -- it's not weighted disproportionately to Industrial, the challenge on that one or it is? Michael Lamach : Well, res HVAC would be a big part of it, and the balance would be Industrial, I think. Susan Carter : Yes, it's about 50-50. It's not overweighted to Industrial. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then on the IRS litigation, assuming that the settlement, that, that's all finalized, just looking through the Q and your exposures that you had called out publicly before, looks like, just adding all that up, you're closer to -- it looks like something like $1.8 billion to $2 billion, depending on how you count the '07 to '11. But this gets rid of all of that, and it also -- there's nothing else that's pending out there, right? So this completely removes the litigation as called out in the filing, is that correct? Michael Lamach : '02 through '11, all open issues and items are addressed. So again, it's the [indiscernible] on things. And then if you look at sort of '12 and on, I mean, these are just normal open audits that the IRS would normally be working within any company. It's something where, if you've gone from '02 through '11, and then you have a change, '12 through '15, in terms of how you're sort of looking at managing your taxes, it would be very hard to assume they would assert anything that was already agreed to between '02 and '11. So my guess would be although that '12 through '15 is not part of the agreement in writing, it would be logical to assume that you wouldn't see those same issues asserted, since we have sort of settled that already. Steven Winoker : Okay, great. And then maybe just one last one. On non-resi, a little more depth there. You guys are really -- it sounds like significant strength. You mentioned schools, but any place else where it's giving you confidence of a really, I guess, a long-lasting rebound, Mike? Michael Lamach : Well, what's interesting for us, I would say, Steve, now is that the institutional markets, we're really strong, but we're pulling that with controls and performance contracting. And the performance contracting projects, we booked one, kind of in the mid-$30 million range for a school this past quarter. We've got some very large ones booking in other verticals in Q3 and Q4, it's larger than that. They are slow burns, 18 months, 2 years, in terms of the project cycle that have to be managed. They put a little bit of pressure on the gross margin, because you end up with a lot of pass-through subcontracts. But they're accretive to the contribution margins because all of your costs are embedded in those projects, right? Everything down to the commissions for the salespeople, if you will, right, are embedded in the project margins. So I think you might see some larger numbers start coming out there. I think the nice part about it is these are 10-, 15-, 20-year deals, where it's equipment, controls, service, all bundled together. And it's a really nice project management business that's helping us from an energy retrofit perspective, just being able to take on and do really large projects effectively for customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Marketing. Jeffrey Hammond : So it looks like you're coming up against some tougher order comps. And I think you mentioned China up 33% in 4Q, and I think you had some really good order growth in back half, Europe last year. As you look at kind of quoting activity and thinking about that tougher comp, how should we think about order momentum into the back half? Michael Lamach : Quoting activity in commercial HVAC, North America is very strong. Performance in Europe in HVAC continues to be very strong, double digits, again strong, continues to go well. Middle East, same thing, double digits, teens-type growth there. The low activity is in, really, Latin America. Choppy activity is what you see, really, through China but all of Asia Pacific. And then, really, in Industrial, big machines, Sue kind of highlighted there what the strengths were, so I won't reiterate that. Probably a little bit more of the choppiness comes back into some of the plant there, where you could see some air pockets from month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, that I think is just indicative of the overall economy. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay. And then just on residential, I mean, you mentioned kind of mixing down. And it seems like the market is kind of going the other way. So can you just talk strategically how you're kind of positioning that business? And how you feel like you're doing competitively? It seems like you have a little bit lower growth rates versus some of the competitors. Michael Lamach : Well, Q2, that wouldn't be the case, actually. The data we got from HR would say it was a really good quarter for us in Q2 and actually year-to-date. So I don't -- it's a little tough with all the data you get and reporting people do, but the benefit is, at least in North America and the U.S., with the HR data, we're able to see that relative to the marketplace. So we had a really good quarter and it's been a good couple of -- a good 6-month period there. It's hard for our business, Trane, American Standard, to do anything but mix down, because historically, we only played at one end of the spectrum. So whole strategy has been for years now to build a product line that runs the gamut, so the dealer has the opportunity to use the product line across all aspects of the price points customers want to pay. So it would not be at all unusual for us to see motor-bearing units going up, and obviously, as you sell 13 SEER, 14 SEER, the mix goes down a little bit. Nothing unusual or unplanned about that at all. In fact, I would say, to reiterate [ph], that we're getting more of our channel base and our dealer base to use more products across their businesses. That feeds the parts business, and it feeds everything down the road, including replacements, too, so it's all good. Operator : And our last question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : You said -- a follow-up on the IRS settlement. And Sue said there'd be no change at this time to the tax rate. But would there be any change to how you're booking intercompany debt? Is there a P&L effect? And would we be able to see that? Susan Carter : No, Deane. There shouldn't really be that much of a change and so really, that change has already happened. So if you think back to the inversion debt, which was a big part of this settlement, that inversion debt was gone at the end of 2011. And then we've simplified the structure, even as we went through the Allegion spin in 2013. And we've really been very conscious of making sure that we're using our Irish domicile in the right ways for moving cash around the globe, but not really being aggressive on any of the different items. We've said a number of times that we've been playing it right down the middle of the fairway, and that has been the case for the last few years, and so I don't expect any change to that at all. Deane Dray : Great. Just last question. With copper at a 6-year low, I know you've always stayed very disciplined in terms of doing your laddered purchasing, you've got 70% already purchased. But with copper at these levels, would you ever consider walking in a -- or extending the duration of these hedges or advanced purchasing? Susan Carter : Yes, I think the -- we have a commodity team that looks at all of these different items and a policy that gives us some flexibility when we do have prices that are at an all-time low and so that's something that we continuously monitor, and the sourcing group is doing a good job of making sure that where it makes sense, that we take advantage of that. Deane Dray : Has that happened yet? Michael Lamach : We've got about 1/4 unlocked in Q3 and about 1/3 unlocked in Q4. So there's a little bit more room there than we normally have to go take advantage of stock rates anyway, Deane. Operator : I'd like to hand the call back over to Janet Pfeffer for closing remarks, please. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, Earl, and thank you, everyone. Joe and I will be around if you have any follow-up questions. Have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

This release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables, which were attached to our news release this morning. With that, let me turn it over to Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. Mike? Michael Lamach : Great. Thanks, Janet. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the third quarter, we exceeded our EPS forecast, improved operating performance and delivered profitable growth through solid execution that more than offset headwinds from the global economic environment. Our operating income and operating margin percent were both all-time records, particularly good performance in the face of a slowdown in the Industrial segment and in the Asian and Latin American regions. Our team responded well to the challenges. We were able to overdeliver on our commitments despite lower-than-forecasted revenues. Adjusted earnings per share were $1.21. That's up 10% versus the third quarter of 2014. That compares to our guidance range of $1.15 to $1.19. So adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.04 better than our guidance midpoint.  Revenues were approximately $50 million lower than the midpoint of our guidance forecast, about half of that from more unfavorable FX and about half from lower volume. And that translates to a couple of cents headwind versus our earnings guidance.  The tax rate was also a little higher, and that was another $0.02 of headwind. These headwinds were more than compensated for by higher productivity and lower spending as well as a slightly lower share count driving the $0.04 earnings outperformance. Organic revenue growth was 6%, led by strength in the U.S. and European Transport and Commercial HVAC businesses as well as Residential HVAC. Europe and the Middle East, excluding currency, remains strong. Ex currency, Latin America was down low single digits, as strong results in Mexico partially offset weakness in Brazil. Excluding currency, Asia revenues were down 3%, reflecting continued weakness in China and emerging markets. Climate organic growth was 8%. Industrial markets were weaker in the quarter. Organic revenue and Industrial was down 2%. As you'll see when I get to the forecast, we adjusted our fourth quarter down slightly to reflect slower Industrial markets and currency. Organic orders in the third quarter were up 1%, impacted by tough comparisons in Transport against record orders in 2014 as well as a slowdown in Industrial.  Commercial HVAC bookings, excluding foreign exchange, were up low single digits, and were up mid-single digits in North America. Adjusted operating margins increased 1 full percentage point as stronger productivity and pricing, combined with deflation, more than offset negative currency, investments and other inflation. We repurchased about 4 million shares in the quarter and have completed our announced $250 million of share repurchase in early October. And now I'll turn it over to Sue, and then I'll come back to you to take you through the fourth quarter outlook. Susan Carter : Thanks, Mike. Let's go to Slide 4, please. Orders for the third quarter of 2015 were down 2% on a reported basis and up 3% excluding currency. On an organic basis, which excludes both currency and acquisitions, orders were up 1%. Climate orders were up 3% excluding currency. Commercial HVAC bookings were up low single digits, and Residential HVAC bookings were up mid-teens.  Transport orders were down, primarily due to difficult comparisons with record 2014 bookings in North American Transport and in Marine. Organic orders for Industrial were down 4%. Organic orders decreased by mid-single digits in Air and Industrial products and improved by low single digits in Club Car.  Please go to Slide 5. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, third quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis and up 6% on an organic basis, which excludes both foreign exchange and acquisitions. Climate revenues increased 8% on an organic basis. Industrial revenues were down 2% organically. I'll give more color on each segment in just a few slides.  The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis, as reported and organic. Organic revenues were up 7% in the Americas, up 10% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, both led by strong HVAC and Transport performance, and Asia was down 3%. Let's go to Slide 6, please. This chart shows the change in operating margin from third quarter 2014, up 13%, to third quarter of 2015, which was 13.6% on a reported basis and 14% on an adjusted basis.  Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively were a 20 basis point headwind to operating margin versus prior year. Within that, about 40 points negative was from currency and 20 points positive from volume mix.  Price and direct material inflation contributed 60 basis points to margin with positive price and direct material deflation. This is consistent with the expectations we gave you in July, as the positive gap widens in the second half of the year from material deflation.  Productivity versus other inflation was positive 90 basis points driven by strong productivity and cost containment. Year-over-year investments and other items were 70 basis points. That breaks into 3 pieces. This is the first year in which Cameron is included in our results and impacted margins by 20 basis points due to intangible amortization. In the box, you can see 20 basis points of headwind from investments and 30 basis points from higher restructuring costs.  In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 45%. Backing out currency and acquisitions, organic leverage was 41%. That is better leverage than our July guidance, as lower revenues were more than offset by productivity and spend controls.  Let's go to Slide 7, please. The Climate Segment includes Trane commercial and residential HVAC and Thermo King Transport refrigeration. Total revenues for the third quarter were $2.8 billion. That is up 4% versus last year on a reported basis and up 8% ex currency. Third quarter organic Commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Excluding currency, Commercial HVAC revenues in North America increased by mid-single digits compared with last year and increased by high-teens percentage in Europe and Middle East, and HVAC revenues in Asia were flat. The North American Residential HVAC market continued an orderly transition to the new regional SEER standards. Residential HVAC revenues were up low teens. Thermo King revenues were up low teens ex currency with strong gains in North America. In Europe, organic revenues were up low teens. Climate's margin performance was strong. Adjusted operating margin for Climate was 15.8% in the quarter, 150 basis points higher than the third quarter of 2014 due to productivity and volume/mix, partially offset by other inflation, currency and higher investment spending.  Please go to Slide 8. Third quarter revenues for the Industrial Segment were $729 million, down 2% on a reported basis and also down 2% organically as revenues from the Cameron acquisition offset the negative impact of currency. Air Systems and Services, Power Tools, Fluids Management and Material Management organic revenues were down mid-single digits versus last year. Organic revenues were down low single digits in the Americas, up low single digits in Europe, Middle East and Africa and down in Asia. Third quarter organic revenues from Parts and Service increased mid-single digits. Club Car revenues, excluding currency, were up high single digits. Industrial's adjusted operating margin performance was strong in the face of volume challenges. Adjusted operating margin was 14.4%, down 40 basis points when compared with 14.8% last year. However, the Cameron acquisition, including known purchase accounting impacts and negative currency, account for 190 basis points of downward pressure on Industrial margin. On lower volume, the team delivered pricing and strong productivity and cost savings initiatives to more than offset inflation and investments.  Please go to Slide 9. For the third quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.4%. The increase versus prior year is primarily inventory. This includes some incremental inventory to support Q4 air compressor shipments and some prebuild of inventories prior to ERP system go-live, which went live in October without event. Also the lower growth forecast puts pressure on inventory, which will probably end the year higher than our prior forecast. We had good collections in the quarter, and our DSO improved year-over-year.  Our balance sheet remained very strong. We have no debt maturities this year. We expect adjusted free cash flow in 2015 to be in the range of $950 million, which excludes the IRS payments and restructuring. That would be within a couple of points of our 100% of net income target for cash generation.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike. Michael Lamach : Great. Thanks, Sue, and please go to Slide 10. North American institutional markets continued the recovery in the third quarter. There's no change to our revenue forecast there. We also continue to see growth in Commercial and Industrial buildings and retrofit. We still expect mid- to high single-digit growth for 2015 in North America and Commercial HVAC markets. The regional standards change in Residential HVAC is going as planned. We expect motor-bearing unit shipments for the year to be flat, up low single digits in 2015, reflecting the prebuy that occurred in the back part of 2014. To round up North American Climate Segment markets, we expect North American transport markets to be up double digits in 2015, reflecting good trends in trailer, truck and APUs for most of the year.  North American Industrial markets have remained fairly weak. Gulf markets are expected to be up low single digits. We expect Latin American, Asian, European and Middle East HVAC equipment markets in the aggregate to be up low to mid-single digits at constant currency, but flat to down after considering currency. Within those regions, Europe and the Middle East have been relatively strong for us, excluding currency. Asia had slowed since July, and we now expect Asian markets to be down for the year. We expect European transport markets to be down, including FX, but up at constant currency. Industrial markets in Europe and the Middle East, Latin American and Asia are more challenging, and we expect these markets to be down for the full year.  Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2015 to be up about 3% versus 2014. Our prior range was 4% to 5%. So in total, we're reducing the back half revenue forecast by about $140 million. As I said earlier, $50 million of that happened in the third quarter.  Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 4 percentage points, which reflects the deterioration of several currencies since July, when the expected impact was 3% to 4% negative. We expect acquisitions to add about 3 points for the year. Organic growth, ex currency and acquisitions, remains at the same 4% to 5% range we gave in July. We expect Climate revenues to be up about 3% on a reported basis and approximately 6% organically. There was very little change in the Climate revenue outlook, only about $25 million or $30 million. And it's mainly a reflection of softer FX rates than in July and reflects continued weakness in China. For the Industrial Segment, revenues are now forecast to be in the range of up approximately 3% on a reported basis, which compares to an anticipated growth of 6% to 7% in July. In dollar terms, the full year Industrial forecast was lower by about $120 million. It's almost all from lower volumes, as short-cycle markets have not recovered, as well as allowing for some shipment push-outs on larger machines. You might recall that our July forecast needed about 2% organic growth in Industrial in the second half. The new forecast reflects about 2% contraction and organic growth in the second half in Industrial.  Within the Industrial Segment, organic revenues are now forecast to be down 1% for the full year compared to our July view of up 1% to 2%, reflecting the softness we saw in the third quarter and continued weakness in overseas markets. For operating margins, we still expect Climate margins to be in a range of 13%, identical to our prior guidance. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be up -- to be approximately 14%, also identical to our prior guidance, as higher productivity and continued spending controls are offsetting the impact of lower volumes. Please go to Slide 11. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance range has been tightened to $3.69 to $3.74, an increase of 11% to 12% versus 2014. That excludes acquisition step-up, restructuring, the Venezuelan currency devaluation and the IRS agreement. It slightly moves the midpoint for the year down by $0.02, which reflects lower revenue backdrop that we're entering the fourth quarter with, and partially offset by the cost actions that are taken, and that'll continue. The range for reported, or GAAP, continuing EPS is $2.57 to $2.62.  Fourth quarter revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 3% on a reported basis and on an organic basis. Currency impact offsets the impact of acquisition.  Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $0.90 to $0.95. We expect about $0.02 restructuring costs and a $0.01 related to taxes for Venezuela. Including these, the reported continuing EPS range is $0.87 to $0.92.  We have provided an EPS bridge for the fourth quarter in the appendix to give you the walk from year-to-year. The fourth quarter forecast would put leverage, excluding currency and acquisition, so organic leverage, at about 75% and about 2.5 percentage points of growth. That higher-than-normal leverage is driven by strong productivity, material deflation in the quarter and includes $15 million lower corporate expense than last year.  Before we go to questions, you might have seen the announcement we made this morning naming Todd Wyman as the President of our Compressed Air Systems and Services business. Many of you have had the opportunity to meet Todd since he joined us 6 years. ago. He's been instrumental in our value stream transformation and the development of the company's business operating system, which is the foundation for the company's growth and Operational Excellence strategies. Todd's global business experience and demonstrated success in strategy implementation makes him highly qualified to serve as the Compressed Air Systems and Services business President. Keith Sultana was named to succeed Todd as Senior Vice President, Operations and Integrated Supply Chain for the company, including leading our Operational Excellence strategy. Keith joined Ingersoll Rand 7 years ago and most recently served as Vice President of Global Procurement. Before that, Keith led the Global Integrated Supply Chain for the company's commercial heating, ventilating and air conditioning business in North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa. Before that, he led the Climate Solutions and Industrial Technologies sectors. So our commitment to our business operating system remains as strong as ever. At one point or another, Keith has had direct manufacturing and supply chain responsibility for every IR business, which makes him an ideal successor to Todd. These changes reflect our commitment to premiere performance and aligning capabilities with business opportunities and market conditions, and they are consistent with our organizational leadership development plans. So in conclusion, our strategies for growth and Operational Excellence have delivered a 5-year trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement, and they remain the right strategies for the future. This quarter's performance was a demonstration of our focus on meeting or exceeding our commitments to you. Our focus remains to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementation of our strategies. We have already taken and will continue to take action to generate growth and earnings as needed to respond to market conditions. And so with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : So I just want to start off with the change of management for the Industrial segment. So congratulations to Todd and Keith on their new roles. I'm just wondering what, if anything, changes in terms of the margin orders for Industrial tech? And the reason I ask the question, Mike, is that -- the margins there attract a lot of investor attention, and I'm just wondering is there a recognition, given Todd's background, that perhaps there's a -- should be a sharper focus on productivity and cost containment there? Michael Lamach : We're looking at the opportunities, Nigel, and we're dead committed to the 17% to 19% operating margins that we've communicated in the past. We want to accelerate that as quickly as possible. And for the segment to achieve that, we've got to achieve that in the Compressed Air business first and foremost. So the effort here would be certainly on all of the growth and Operational Excellence activities in the company. We see great opportunity in the value stream work in accelerating that, reaccelerating that. So it's really, I think, a tribute to Todd's leadership, but also to a commitment to being on-track and getting ourselves on track for that business. Nigel Coe : Okay. Fair enough. And just a quick follow-on there, Mike. the 50 bps of price cost benefit this quarter are consistent with commentary, but I think probably a little bit better than certainly what we expected. Does that continue to get better as the hedges start to roll off on the copper and aluminum? Or is this a pretty good run rate from here? Susan Carter : So Nigel, let's think about the cost -- or the price and material from a longer-term perspective. So what we would have as a goal is we'd have a goal to have a spread between direct material inflation and price of about 20 to 30 basis points for the year. What we said when we talked in July was that in the second half of 2015 we would see wider spreads because the material deflation was really kicking in, which is exactly what we saw in that 60-bp spread. But in general, we're still targeting about 30 percentage points of spread for the year. And then as we look at going forward, we'd hang onto that goal of having a positive spread of 20 to 30 basis points. So I don't think that as you look forward, at least in the near term, that 2016 commodities are going to increase. We've got about 50% of our copper for 2016 locked in. However, I think it's more realistic to think about the overall spread being 20 to 30 basis points rather than a 60 basis point spread being a new normal. I don't think that works. Michael Lamach : We might have give [indiscernible], Nigel, more than we thought, really. But we kind of thought 50. It was 60, so it's pretty close to the number that we had thought. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Just quickly on Cameron and just the M&A impact. Just wanted to check my math. It sounds like you've actually held your Cameron forecast, if I'm assuming a 3% acquisition contribution, that would imply about $380 million in revenues in the back half with FRIGOBLOCK, so the end was -- we end up with, like, $340-ish million for Cameron. It sounds like no change there, but then, Mike, you also made a comment about derisking Cameron a little bit. So can you just reconcile that? Or am I missing something in that math? Michael Lamach : Jeff, great question. Let me walk through -- so I talked about the fact that we reduced the back half of the year in total for the company by $140 million. $50 million of that would have happened in Q3, so $90 million relating to Q4. Also, so we have that, the attributable change to Climate, really, let's call it, $30 million, leaving $60 million in the Industrial businesses. We think about the Cameron piece of large machines, and we took a $20 million to $25 million view of risk on that saying that we know of some instances, and perhaps we'll know of some more, delays for, often times, customer acceptance or readiness on those sites. So think about $20 million, $25 million being associated with big machines. The balance of that could be split 50-50 between all of what the short cycle replenishment is in Industrial and FX. Again, so if you look at sort of the Cameron piece of this on the large machine exposure, $20 million, $25 million. And then if you look at just short-cycle recovery, some of that would be plant air for both Ingersoll Rand legacy and Cameron, it would be the normal smaller plant air. We're not seeing the order rates returning there. We're seeing some slowdown with capital spending from Industrial customers in Q3 and Q4, and so there's a bit of that in there as well. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. And then just shifting gears, on TK, orders, down on tough comps, but the comps are going to stay tough, right, in North America, in particular, in trailer. How do you see things playing out? Should we still be thinking about double-digit-type decline or more in trailer in North America in 2016? Susan Carter : So Jeff, let me give that a shot. So you're right, as we look at the order rates for North America for trailer in the third quarter, they declined again. We expected that. We talked about some of those orders being roughly at peak in the second quarter, and it really is a tough compare to 2014. So when we look at the fourth quarter, so first, I'll take fourth quarter, we expect the trailer orders again to show negative year-over-year comparisons, again, based on really strong 2014, actually, record order levels last year. And so what we're looking at is the tough comparisons on TK in total, orders for the third quarter in overseas markets were actually down, and ex currency, we're roughly flat. But you also asked a question about 2016. So if we look at what's out there in terms of ACT data, so we're not talking about our forecast, but we're looking at ACT data, we still are seeing forecasts for that to come down in the ranges of probably some of those double digits. But we're closely assessing the markets, especially in trailer, and looking at the record volumes. So not really a precise answer, but the tough comps are really the big part of the story, and in 2016, ACT doesn't see much change from their prior outlook. Michael Lamach : Jeff, if you took that 10% or 15% kind of as sort of the market for North American trailer and recognize it's a little bit less than 25% of our business, we're probably going to see pretty good markets in Europe and Middle East. We're seeing probably good markets for Marine, rail, bus and for our air refrigeration businesses. So we talked about the scenario last time that a 10% to 15% decline in North American trailer is something where we think we could still grow margins in the TK business and potentially actually grow the top line, but that's not to be concluded until we finalize the plan. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Just to clarify that answer for Jeff. On the Cameron deal, you had originally promised $0.08 to $0.10 of gross accretion for 2015. So bottom line, like, where is that -- what number looks like you're going to achieve this year on that? Michael Lamach : So cash accretion is at about $0.08, maybe a little bit better, but about $0.08. Steven Winoker : Okay, great. And then on the restocking impact in resi and destocking across Industrial, what are you seeing? What kind of impact do you think that's happening -- having on the business? Michael Lamach : Well, Residential is lumpy, Steve. So that's hard for a quarter-to-quarter compare with Altap [ph] and with the change in SEER regulations, but -- our global Residential business was up mid-teens but our North American Residential bookings were up high teens. I wouldn't put a lot of stock into the booking numbers and just some of the anomalies from quarter-to-quarter. The industrial restocking is just more of an indication of slowing industrial markets and the fact that companies like ours are probably pulling in a bit on CapEx, and we see our Service businesses growing. So one thing you see in a typically mild pullback in either Commercial or Industrial space is the Service business should grow, and our Service business grew mid-single digits in Industrial, which is pretty good performance. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then just following up your point about 30 basis points ongoing price versus raws. And if I think about same growth rate, maybe, next year as this year for the overall business, if that were to be the case, do you think you can hold these kinds of mid-40s organic incrementals? Susan Carter : I think, Steve, we'd look at really more along the lines of what we've said longer-term, which is we're more comfortable with looking at incrementals that are at our gross margin levels as opposed to trying to project what happens to all of those. And I understand the comment on deflation and the productivity that we've had, but I think there's going to be some other areas that are going to have tougher comps in 2016 going forward. So I think, the price spread of 20 to 30 bps and our incremental leverage being at the gross margin levels are probably better longer-term ways of just thinking about the business. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : I was hoping Sue could clarify the comment on expectations for, you say inventory increasing in the fourth quarter, just -- and its impact on your free cash flow conversion. Susan Carter : Right. So I'm hoping that our inventory does not increase in the fourth quarter. What I meant, and hopefully what I said is right now, our inventory level are higher than what we would have seen a year ago. Part of that is because of the buildup of the air compressor inventory for Q4 shipment, part of that is the prebuild for the ERP go-live and some other impacts from, actually, revenue decreasing. But what I expect to see in the fourth quarter is I expect to see the inventory come down, but the comment is that I don't really expect it to get back to the previous levels. So a year ago levels at the end of 2015. So we'll continue to work all of that off. It doesn't mean it's an issue. It just means it's just going to be slightly heavier. And what we've done, to answer your question, on a free cash flow basis, is that we did -- our original range was $950 million to $1 billion. We said roughly $950 million at this point in time. And what we're doing from a free cash flow perspective is everything that you might expect us to do, which is we're overdriving performance on receivables, we are looking at all of the things that make sense in terms of being tight on all the other elements of free cash flow to make up for the fact that we've got a little bit more inventory than what we had a year ago. So I don't think any of this is an issue. I think our free cash flow, being at 98% of sort of projected net income, is right in line with where we'd like it to be. So I don't think it's a problem. I think it's just going to be a little higher than it was a year ago. Steven Winoker : So that's that -- I appreciate that clarity. And Mike, I was hoping you could comment on the European strength in Climate. Did that surprise you at all? Is -- how much mix is a factor there? And it looks like you could be getting some share gains. Michael Lamach : Well, it's been surprising us for a couple of years in terms of just the success that I think we've had with there. But as I've said in the past, we've got an excellent team leading the business and a lot of new product and services being launched into the marketplace. So a continued good performance there. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just a question on Industrial. I think you're guiding for Q4 organically to be down about the same degree in revenues as Q3, so maybe down about 2% year-on-year. But the orders progression has got worse Q3 versus Q2, and the organic sales hurdle is higher in Q4. So maybe just confirm if that's really the case. And maybe talk a little bit about how you're seeing industrial demand trending kind of within the quarter and in the last couple of months, specifically. Michael Lamach : The widest area now, Julian, that we have, I think, is really in China, which really runs a pretty wide range of worst case, best case. And so -- we're taking something on a more conservative range in China at this point, and that's really the wild card. The balance of it is really just sort of the booking turn we know of and some conservative views now on restocking for some of the stock businesses. Susan Carter : Yes, and I would think, Julian, that you're right. We -- when we talked to you in July, we had seen some short-cycle markets recover in June, some but not all, certainly. And that re-acceleration didn't continue in the third quarter as we had anticipated, and so we did lower our Industrial organic growth outlook for the second half from plus 2% to minus 2%. So you're absolutely right. Julian Mitchell : Got it. But I guess, you're not expecting the decline to get worse in Q4 even though you have a tougher comp in Industrial? Michael Lamach : Yes, a little -- we had a little bit of a surprise -- favorability in bookings in Latin America in the compressor business, a bit of a surprise. And again, we think we've taken a conservative view, and China team has a road map on some larger orders that could close, but I think we've got this tackled with the $90 million in the back half, $60 million of it really being attributed to -- I'm sorry, back in the fourth quarter, $90 million for the company, $60 million in Industrial. We think we've got it covered here with what we know of today. Julian Mitchell : And then just a quick follow-up on train in Asia. I think that, obviously, the trends even back in July were pretty unsteady in China. Maybe just talk a little bit about how you've seen the order intake and the backlog moving there. Susan Carter : So let's just kind of talk about China in general. So obviously, economic growth rate significantly below the historic rates, with the government attempting to rebalance the economy and all of those different pieces. Some of that's not smooth. Some of it's lumpy, and so some of the comparisons get a little volatile if you just go from quarter-to-quarter. But if we look at HVAC bookings in China for the quarter, they were actually up low single digits versus last year. And for the quarter, HVAC revenues in China are expected -- or I'm sorry, for fourth quarter, the HVAC revenues in China are expected to be down low single digits as -- and part of that is applied systems and the growth there being more than offset by lower unitary revenues and currency. And so there's a lot of different pieces that are moving around. If we just looked at nonresidential construction market starts in the fourth quarter of last year, some of that continued into the second half of 2015. Some of the areas of strength or verticals where we do see some growth would be data centers, healthcare and mix development opportunities. Michael Lamach : The good news there, Julian, was the fourth quarter positive bookings in HVAC in China. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Mike or Sue, just on the -- to clarify the leverage point in the fourth quarter, I think you said corporate going down $15 million to $60 million. Is there some other maybe offset below the line in other income or anything that we should be aware of? It just seems like I end up a little high, if that's -- if corporate goes down $15 million. Susan Carter : Well -- so when you think about the fourth quarter leverage and the different pieces, in the spot where you're going to look at what's happening is, if our organic growth is going to be in the range of 2% to 3%, so you've got $75 million to $80 million of revenue, if you've got productivity and direct material inflation with still continuing to get price. And if those are the primary drivers of productivity in the fourth quarter, and you have lower corporate, to your point, the math does work out to be in the 75% to 80% range for the fourth quarter. Michael Lamach : And, Shannon, another way to look at it, it's $75 million of revenue at the midpoint. $40 million in OI on that. Take $15 million off for corporate. Now you're talking about really $25 million on $75 million. You've got 33% leverage. And look at the price deflation spread, look at the productivity of other inflation spread, and it's really a doable number. Julian Mitchell : Okay. And then there's nothing -- I know your other line moves around. There's nothing funny -- or different going on there, I mean, it's been bouncing all over the place. It's tough to know how to model that. it's mainly currency, but do you have anything moving significantly down the other line? Susan Carter : No, so the fourth quarter should be relatively flat. So not really a lot of movement there that we're looking at. Julian Mitchell : Just on the Commercial HVAC bookings, up mid-single digits in the Americas. Do you have the, sort of, North America split of that, I think you used to give? And is there any parts of North America that you see getting better or worse? Michael Lamach : Applied is trending as we said, applied mid-single. It's sort of the institutional piece of that large unitary that applies to institutional is -- the larger unitary is doing clearly well. The open-quote backlog sort of matches what the booking trends looks like, which give us some sense that, if you think about open-quote log pre-dating bookings by 3 to 6 months, the rate stays fairly consistent going into 2016. So I think that it's shaping up like we thought, which is this mid-single-digit institutional recovery that should last a few years. Dodge data still is quite a bit more aggressive on that. They're showing institutional put in place '16 versus '15 up 14%, starts up 10%. But I think as you well know, it's historically been fairly high and it comes down throughout the year. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : On -- just following up on Shannon's question, what -- can you just give us kind of the approximate margins? There's some rounding dynamics here, and you guys have some squiggly lines next to the numbers annually, and so I'm just having a little bit of trouble, again, getting kind of low enough for the fourth quarter. Can you just give us a rough -- more rough approximation of what the 4Q is for the segments, margin-wise? Susan Carter : So if we're looking at the total year for Industrial being in the range of 13%, or roughly 14%, so you're right, we've got a little bit of a squiggle in there. What would that would imply for the fourth quarter on Industrial is margins in sort of the 15.5-ish type of range. And part of that gets driven by the compressor shipments in the fourth quarter, as well as continued productivity and a lower inflationary-type environment. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then for Climate, I think we're backing into something of around 13.5%. Is that about right? Susan Carter : So Climate, with the sort of 13% that we're looking at for the full year, would be -- if you backed into a Climate midpoint, would just be a smidge under the 13% range for the fourth quarter. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. That makes more sense. And just last question, just on the Resi dynamics, what will mix contribute this year? I don't think you guys had great mix in the second quarter like maybe some others did. So there's maybe different timing dynamics around how much 14 SEER you're now selling, how much of that 14 SEER transition is booked this year? And then how much is kind of still yet to come for next year? Michael Lamach : So we've had some negative mix, Steven, in the year with 14 SEER, which works itself out this year. But we think that, generally, '14 is accretive to '13, and we're seeing really good margin expansion in the Res business. So in spite of the mix down, '14 for us good -- good absorption, good expansion and it works itself through in 2015. C. Stephen Tusa : And then for '16, is there still some benefit to come there? Michael Lamach : I think there's -- I don't think we've got the issue of mixing down in 2016. I mean, there could be a quarter, 4 or 5 months, but you have to think, with the dynamics of the change this year in terms of stocking -- 13 SEER. But for the most part, no, I then we should be having a pretty clean year next year in terms of mix. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert McCarthy : I guess, the first question I would have is just, taking into account some of your comments around the state of the U.S. nonresi and the limited visibility on the Industrial side, I mean, how do you think about, just directionally, about '16 in terms of EPS growth? And what can you provide, or what can you provide in addition, maybe for CapEx, or you have provided something I think on the margin side, what can you provide about '16, how we should be thinking about it? Michael Lamach : First of all, remember we'll do this in February, so I'll give you just some general sense as to where things are going. But before I do that, step back for a minute, and if we look at 75% of the company as being the Climate Segment. Of that, really 60% of the company is HVAC, and more than 60% of that is in North America. So you've got, really, 40% of the company with pretty strong growth dynamics going into 2016. I think HVAC in Europe, Eastern Europe, even potentially the Middle East, will be growth organically for us, probably not the same rate, of course, as North America, but we've got that growing. So in essence, a large part of the business is growing for us. We think about Industrial, look, I think that Asia and Latin America, is going to continue to be a bit of a struggle, and maybe some currency headwind coming at us, but not -- we see that even with low growth next year will expand margins nicely. I'm not going to give you an EPS number today, but we certainly feel like there's an opportunity, with the pockets we're seeing of growth in 2015, to grow the company. Robert McCarthy : Okay. And then just one follow-up. In terms of just capital allocation and then just reinvestment in the business, given the prevailing environment, is there change or nuance at the margin in terms of M&A or other forms of capital redeployment or internal reinvestment? Susan Carter : No, Robert. When we look at it, we expect to continue the balanced capital allocation that we've got with investment in our businesses. We can expect to continue having a strong dividend payout, so in the 30% to 35% range. We'll continue to, at a minimum, offset dilution with share repurchase activities. And then the remainder of it, we'll basically continue to toggle between value-accretive M&A and additional share repurchase and just evaluate what makes the most sense at any given point in time. Now you had also asked about CapEx. And so generally speaking, our CapEx is usually in a range of about $250 million, which is roughly equal to depreciation, and we don't expect that to change going forward either. Michael Lamach : Both the CapEx and investments are a number that, Robert, we can work with during the year depending on what we see in terms of the environment. So there is some flexibility for us to spend less if we need to, to help bridge some of the EPS commitments that we'll make. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just a couple of questions. First, on Cameron, obviously, backlog is typically weighted to the fourth quarter, but can you give us maybe an indication how order trends and visibility or coverage in the next year looks, maybe versus what normal seasonality should look like? There obviously, don't have a known end of the year yet, but just kind of any color on orders would be helpful. Susan Carter : Sure, Josh. One of the interesting things about the history in what happened in that engineered compressor business is that not only are our shipments back half loaded, but generally, orders in the large engineered compressors are also back half loaded. So we're seeing real time what's happening in the different places in the market. So let me give you a little color on what I think we're seeing and how that translates into what we see for 2016. So, in general, you're going to look at this space being negatively impacted by all of the oil and gas majors are going cutting capital 20% to 30%. There's industry consolidation. EPC activity has slowed. And so when you think about projects, there's probably, in general, fewer projects, same number of competitors, which means that you need to be a really sharp, you need to be really focused and really work at the orders. Now having said that, if I break down the different pieces of the business, so on processed gas, which is roughly a quarter of the business, there's still some growth from the natural gas side of things and LNG. There are some Middle East project delays. However, you've got petrochemical doing okay, power gen, particularly in Europe, being an area where there's some projects and things that we can look at. And so when we think about the processed gas, one of the things that you can start to think about is on the chemical side, or petrochemicals, is does the lower gas price give you a lower feedstock price and does it change some of those dynamics? I don't know. But still a tough environment with, as I said, fewer projects and some things happening. On engineered Air, so another quarter of the business, you've still got air separation, particularly in the China market that, to be honest, I don't see changing anytime soon. There's going to be some activity, but there's going to be a lot lower activity. And if you looked at just what's happening from industrial gas businesses and activity, you'd see lower activity in the first half versus 2014 and 2015, and I'm not sure that, that changes. And again, that's an industry looking at projects where we might take plays with some of that engineered air product. With again, air separation, you've got overcapacity, lower steel demand and all of that. On plant air, which is a book-and-turn piece of the business, it's roughly flat versus 2014. There's still some good markets out there with auto, food and beverage. Europe's a little slower on that side, and Asia is down. And then the aftermarket for the business is where opportunities still exist. And so in general, you've got softer markets, still some projects moving forward, but we're in the period when a lot of the orders take place and so we're -- we've got our eye on what happens in 2016 with all the different pieces. Michael Lamach : Synergy-wise, too, Josh, we're really on track there with, as an example, just sort of the plant air, the revenue synergies, the cost synergies. And if anything, over the last few months, we've gotten an sort of even more conviction around the opportunity for the engineering, supply chain and manufacturing synergies that could exist in the business. So I think that we'll continue to make the business accretive. And in 2016, we'll make sure that if we've got the weakness that Sue's talking about, now that we've got a response to keep the margins at or better than where they were this year. We have a roadmap to do that. Susan Carter : Yes, and I think the bottom line of all of that is it's still a great business and it's still great products for us. And like I say, in spite of all of the things that I said about the market, it's accretive in 2015, and we're getting the synergies. So there's more to come on this one. Joshua Pokrzywinski : That's great detail. And if I could just ask a follow-up on TK. I've heard that some of the trailer guys have opened up the order books maybe a month or so early than they normally would, for the following year. Is that something you guys have seen? And is any of the strength in North America this quarter maybe a month or so pull-ahead from what you might normally have seasonally? Michael Lamach : Well, it's very spotty on which customers open up their order books and whose customers they are. So you could take the top 10 in customers, they're going to order at different points in time. But yes, I would say in the third quarter, you had some customers open up their order books, and we've seen the same thing happen in the past, where there's a little bit of an anomaly between who's ordering. So we're aware of who's ordered and who's left to order, and I don't think we're seeing a lot of dynamic shift in that. But you will see differences in book rates and revenue rates depending on when that occurs. Some of these guys will buy 1,000, 2,000 to 3,000 units, and so it makes a difference when you're looking at a 7,000 to 9,000 -- a 6,000 to 8,000-unit month, which is what we've been seeing the last few months. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Just a question. There was some debate inside the company about how to look at the value stream process, and at the Analyst Day, you had indicated that you are reassessing your approach because you've sort of touched a lot of low-hanging fruit. And then we seem to have had a pause in execution last quarter, and this quarter, operating leverage just seemed to have come through very nicely. Can you describe to us what internal operating changes you've been implementing over the past 6 months to address this next level of operating improvement? Michael Lamach : Yes. A lot, Andrew. I'm not sure I'll cover it here. It would be a great discussion that we could have when we're together for our review this spring, in general. But we've used these product growth teams as a basis to expand the effort across the company. We've continued to now touch really all of the business with their value streams. Sourcing has become, I think, mature across the company. We have got really good productivity the last 3 quarters, really, in general. If you look past Q2 and kind of look at the last 3 quarters, we're seeing productivity accelerate. It's never really that linear. I know we'd all like for it to be, but it's not. We'll have projects and ideas that, at a certain point in time, pit in a quarter, and those make a difference. Higher volumes would make even a more positive difference, of course. So we're doing this all with actually quite sort of low volumes in some of our businesses. So we're excited that if volumes do return, we'd see even better productivity on the changes that we've made. And so, look, I think that we haven't really changed the operating system in 5 years. We've just really looked across as product growth teams that now have touched most or all of the company in one way, shape or form. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question, I apologize if you've answered it already, but can you comment on cadence of industrial orders throughout this quarter? Michael Lamach : Cadence throughout the quarter. I -- there really weren't any sort of high spots in the quarter to say that they were choppy. They were just sort of low in the entire quarter. We had pretty good growth in our Fluids Management business, obviously, which was a highlight for us, kind of a double-digit grower there. That's a good sign. But Material Handling, which is really our only oil exposed business, significant declines. We're off 50% in bookings in that business from prior year. So -- inside Industrial, when you move the compressed air business out of the way and you look at some of the smaller businesses, there's some high and low points, but generally speaking, pretty explainable. If you look at Material Handling, that's a good example of that. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So a quick clarification, Mike, you mentioned earlier the Dodge data on the institutional side and the expectations for next year, but there's been a lot of noise in the data, especially on the Commercial side. I'm just curious, what, if anything, you're seeing, and what you're making of that noise line on the unitary side of your business? Michael Lamach : Well, I think that the large unitary business continues to do well because there's also a lot of large unitary that's put into more of the institutional environment. So that continues. Actually, the commercial activity has been fairly strong. The -- if you split up Commercial and Industrial, Industrial has probably been just a little bit weaker in North America, but not a bad environment, frankly, at all for us. So we continue to think it's a pretty good North American market for both Institutional and Commercial and Industrial. But in terms of strength going forward, it's really Institutional, then Commercial, and then Industrial HVAC kind of trending in that direction. Joseph Ritchie : Okay, that's helpful. And maybe following up on that, how do you think about mix then as you head into next year? Clearly, we've talked a little bit about some North America headwinds on TK, but some of the mix headwinds on resi should subside. How are you guys thinking about mix, particularly in light of the Climate margin target of 13% to 14% for '16? Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, on track, in a nutshell, Joe. I mean, TK still gives us really good volumes from a profitability perspective, we're working with pretty high volumes across-the-board. Even though the year-over-year decrease in the market will be there, we've got plenty of gas left there in growth parts of the business that we didn't have last time around. So we feel pretty good about being able to hold our head up on the TK business. As you look at Climate, great expansion in margins in the res business. I've said before, I'll say it again, mid-teens, mid-teens plus EBITDA. The Commercial business, particularly in Europe, is doing well, and we're hitting some critical mass there that I think will begin to contribute more to the op margins across the business. And then in general, North America just does a really good in terms of share and consistent margin expansion there, and so I feel pretty good about that. The wild cards are really Latin America and Asia for us as it relates to the HVAC businesses. And here, we talk about pricing in China, but it's not sort of an environment that's impossible. It's just more difficult for us. So we're persevering in China. And again, I feel good, at least about the quarter, bookings going in the right direction. Would love to see the next couple of quarters look the same way before I'd feel more constructive about China, about Asia, in general. Operator : And I would now like to turn the call back to Janet Pfeffer for any closing remarks. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Joe and I will be around if you have any follow-up questions, and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude the call. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

So now to introduce the participants in this morning' s call : Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations.  With that, please go to Slide 3. And I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Great. Thanks, Janet. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on today's call. This morning, I'll spend a few minutes recapping our full year 2015 results and our progress on the transformation we've been working on in the company since 2010. Then, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter results, and I'll end up with our outlook for 2016 before we open it up to your questions. So starting with full year 2015. It was a year that I could characterize best by one word, and that word is volatility : volatility in energy markets, in foreign exchange rates, in industrial markets, in emerging markets and, of course, in the stock market. During this period of volatility, while the individual pieces might not each have ended exactly how we had forecast some 12 months ago, our headlines results were essentially right in the forecast we gave you a year ago. The 2015 forecast we gave you a year ago was for 4% to 5% organic growth, and we came in at 5%. Our adjusted EPS forecast was a midpoint of $3.74 or actuals $3.73. that performance was significantly more FX headwind. We had included a $0.17 earnings headwind in currency and guidance and ended up being over $0.30. Our free cash flow forecast was $950 million to $1 billion, and we delivered $985 million. We focused on executing within our business operating system and on the things that we can control, while doing our best to anticipate the things that we couldn't control, and we made adjustments accordingly. 2015 demonstrated continued progress in the implementation of our multiyear strategy for growth, operational excellence and shareholder value. We invested in core businesses, matured in key strategic capabilities and delivered on our financial commitments, all while navigating shifts and challenges in global markets. We have consistently delivered on our commitments, even in volatile times, and we hope that you agree that there are very few companies in your coverage that have done this. I'm very proud of our team and the great people in our company that delivered another solid year. If I look back over a longer horizon over the last, say, 24 months, it's a similar story. With the exception of a single quarter almost 5 years ago, we met or exceeded our earnings commitments regardless of market conditions. For the year, our organic revenues, which excludes OpEx and acquisitions, were up 5%. Markets were uneven around the globe. Growth in North America was in the mid-single digits, while revenues overseas, taken collectively, increased low single digits. Adjusted earnings per share were $3.73, a year-over-year increase of 12%. Within our diversified industrial peer group, we achieved top quartile performance in EPS growth again in 2015. We grew adjusted operating margins 40 basis points in 2015. Our organic operating leverage, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, was 35%, which is above our target range of 25% to 30%. And Climate margins improved 60 basis points. We generated $985 million of cash flow. Our capital allocation strategy remains focused on maximizing shareholder value, and it's consistent with our overall financial strategy. We continued to increase our dividend, with a 16% increase in 2015, and we announced an additional 10% increase in the dividend last week. We repurchased 4.4 million shares for $250 million in 2015, and more recently, we took advantage of some of the volatility in the stock market and accelerated our share repurchases this year, repurchasing 4.9 million shares for $250 million in January of this year. We finalized an agreement with the IRS for the years 2002 through 2011. In December, we announced an agreement to sell our remaining stake in Hussmann, and we expect that to close in April. Our performance in 2015 gives further conviction to our strategy and positions us well as we go into a challenging global economic backdrop in 2016. Please go to Slide 4. We delivered steady improvements in operating margins. Shown here are the last 5 years where operating margins were up 270 basis points since 2011, despite tough years in Industrial in 2014 and 2015. During this same period, our adjusted operating leverage has averaged over 35%. Please go to Slide 5. This chart walks through the change in operating margin from 2014 of 10.9% to 2015, which was 11%. This chart has shown on a reported basis. So it includes restructuring, inventory step-up costs, which were excluded from adjusted margins.  We had 20 basis points of higher restructuring year-over-year and also had a 20 basis point impact inventory step-up on acquisitions. Adjusted margins, which exclude those items, expanded 40 basis points from 11% to 11.4%. The 40 basis points of margin expansion was delivered from the combination of organic growth, maintaining a positive gap between pricing and material inflation through value pricing and pricing analytics and productivity from strategic sourcing, implementing our Lean operating system and overhead cost discipline together outpacing other inflation. Foreign exchange was a drag to margin of 50 basis points. We continued to invest in new products, IT infrastructure and systems and service and sales footprint to underpin the future growth of the business, and those collectively were 30 basis point investment year-over-year. So now, Sue will take you through the fourth quarter, and I'll come back to take you through 2016's outlook. Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide 6. At the summary level, our organic bookings for the quarter were up 2% and organic revenues were up 3%. Residential and commercial HVAC organic revenues were each up 5-plus percent. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.94, up 15% versus last year. Consistent with Mike's commentary, for the full year, the fourth quarter was in line with our earnings guidance. A slightly lower tax rate was offset by slightly higher compensation and benefit costs. Our adjusted operating margins were up 50 basis points. Operating leverage in the quarter was excellent at 34% on an adjusted basis and 55% on an organic basis. Climate margins increased 70 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted Industrial margins were down 200 basis points but were only slightly down on 2% lower organic revenues, when excluding the impact of currency and a rolling in the first year of Cameron Centrifugal operating income and amortization. Finally, as Mike mentioned, given the impending closing of the sale of our Hussmann stake expected on April 1 and to take advantage of market volatility, we repurchased 4.9 million shares in January 2016 for $250 million. Please go to Slide 7. Orders for the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 1% on a reported basis and up 4%, excluding currency. Organic orders were up 2%. Climate orders were up 5% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up low single digits, with a high single-digit increase in North America and declines in Asia and Europe. Organic transport orders were up low single digits with increases in global trailer, truck and auxiliary power units, partially offset by lower marine container orders. Orders in the Industrial segment were down 4% on a reported basis and down 7% organically. We saw high single-digit order decline in Air and Industrial products and a mid-single-digit increase in Club Car. Please go to Slide 8. Here's a look at the revenue trends by segment and region. The top half of the chart shows revenue change for each segment. For the total company, fourth quarter revenues were up 3% versus last year on a reported basis and also up 3% on an organic basis. Climate revenues increased 2% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic basis. Organic commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits with increases in all major geographic regions. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits. Organic transport revenues were down low single digits, as higher truck and trailer revenues were more than offset by lower revenues in marine and APUs. Industrial revenues were up 5% on a reported basis and down 2% organically. Air and Industrial products organic revenues were down low single digits, and Club Car was up slightly. The bottom chart shows revenue change on a geographic basis as reported and on an organic basis. Organic revenues were up 3% in the Americas, up 2% in EMEA and Asia was up 9% with strong growth outside of China. Please go to Slide 9. Operating margin on a reported basis was up 10 basis points from fourth quarter 2014 to fourth quarter of 2015. We've spiked out the restructure impact to get you to adjusted margins as well. Adjusted margins increased 50 basis points from 10.8% to 11.3%. Volume, mix and foreign exchange collectively reflect with 40 basis points of positive margin from volume and mix being offset by foreign exchange. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was favorable by 30 basis points, driven by commodity deflation. Productivity versus other inflation was positive 80 basis points, driven by strong productivity in the quarter. Year-over-year investments and other items reduced margins by 100 basis points. In the box, you can see that it was comprised of 20 basis points from investments, 50 basis points from higher restructuring costs and 30 basis points from acquisitions. In the gray box at the top of the page, overall leverage on an adjusted basis was 34% and if calculated on an organic basis, which excludes foreign exchange and acquisitions, was 55%. Now please go to Slide 10. Total fourth quarter revenues for the Climate segment were $2.5 billion. That is up 2% versus last year on a reported basis and up 5%, excluding currency. Acquisitions in Climate do not change that rounding. So organic revenue is also up 5%. Organic commercial HVAC fourth quarter revenues were up mid-single digits and were up in all geographic regions. North America was up mid-single digits, while EMEA and Latin America were both up low single digits. Asia was up low-teens. The growth in Asia was led by some large HVAC projects in Southeast Asia. Commercial HVAC equipment organic revenues were up low single digits, while HVAC parts, services and solutions revenue were up high single digits versus prior year. Thermo King organic revenues were down low single digits, with truck, trailer revenue up high single digits with growth in both North America and Europe. Marine and APU revenues declined against difficult comparisons to the fourth quarter of last year. Residential HVAC revenues were up mid-single digits versus last year. The adjusted operating margin for Climate was 12.9% in the quarter, 70 basis points higher than fourth quarter of 2014 due to volume and productivity, partially offset by currency and other inflation. Climate's operating leverage was over 50% in the quarter. Now please go to Slide 11. Fourth quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $834 million, up 5% on a reported basis but down 2% on an organic basis.  Compression technologies and services, Power Tools, fluid management and Material Handling organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high single digits, while revenues in EMEA were down low single digits and were up high single digits in Asia due to some large project deliveries. Club Car revenues, excluding foreign exchange, were up slightly versus prior year. Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 13.8% was down 200 basis points compared with last year. When excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency, adjusted margins were down 20 basis points year-over-year on lower over organic revenues. The Engineered Centrifugal Compressor business, or ECC, which we purchased from Cameron in January of 2015, executed well and came in essentially on forecast in the fourth quarter. In 2015, revenues were impacted by weakened industrial markets; however, synergies were above our acquisition model, and EBITDA and cash EPS were both accretive. Please go to Slide 12. For the full year, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.2%. We have strong collections in the quarter with our DSO improving over the prior year. Going forward, we expect working capital to be in the 4% range. Now go to Slide 13, please. Adjusted cash flow generation was excellent at $985 million in 2015. Cash conversion, as a percent of adjusted net earnings, was 101% for the year. As you can see, when we look at 2016, we expect adjusted free cash flow in the range of $950 million to $1 billion. That range excludes the proceeds from the sale of our stake in Hussmann. Our balance sheet remains very strong. We have no debt maturities until 2018.  Please go to Slide 14. Over the last 5 years, we've returned over $6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We employ dynamic model for capital allocation, which adjusts based on market conditions to put our strong free cash flow to the right use for shareholder value. Last week, we announced a 10% increase to our dividend. Our dividend increases over the last 5 years has been a 24% CAGR. Our payout ratio is in line with peers. We've repurchased 103 million shares in the past 5 years from 2011 to 2015. As we said earlier, for 2016, we anticipated some market volatility in January, and were able to accelerate our minimum share repurchase of $250 million to the beginning of the year. We've repurchased 4.9 million shares in January. To remind you, our free cash flow generation is heavily weighted to the second half due to the seasonality of our businesses, namely the HVAC businesses, so our normal timing for share repurchases would have been in second half. But given we have the proceeds from the sale of our Hussmann stake coming in April, we thought it was opportunistic and still within our leverage range to accelerate the minimum repurchase and get that done earlier in the year.  For the balance of 2016, we will use the same approach as the last couple of years, applying a toggle switch between value-accretive acquisitions and share repurchases, based upon relative valuations and risk-adjusted returns. We will apply our same decision-making framework to the situation at that time and leave the door open to pivot to share repurchase or M&A as it makes best sense for our shareholders. For ease of modeling purposes, you'll see that for the 2016 share count, we've applied excess cash to repurchases in the second half of 2016 as we turn cash flow positive. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike to take you through 2016 guidance. Michael Lamach : Great. Thanks, Sue. And please go to Slide 15. As always our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue outlook for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. And as you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC, as well as transport and commercial HVAC markets in Europe are generally positive while global industrial markets remain weak. Transport markets in the Americas will be down -- flat to down, as lower trailer volumes will be largely offset by higher auxiliary power units, small truck refrigeration and other products. The Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat down, and industrial markets in the Asia remain under pressure. Golf and utility vehicle markets are generally flat to slightly up.  All the growth forecasts shown are on an organic basis. We're forecasting low single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, mid-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North American business for us, and flat revenues in Transport. We expect Air and Industrial products, which includes our compression technologies, Power Tools, Material Handling and fluid management SBUs to be down low single digits, and we expect Club Car to be up low single digits. Please go to Slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for full year 2016 to be flat, up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 2 percentage points as we've now completed a full year of Cameron centrifugal compressor division and our results organic revenue growth and excluding FX are the same in this forecast.  Translating that to the segments, we expect Climate revenues to be up 1% to 3% on a reported basis and 3% to 5% excluding currency. The Industrial segment revenues are forecast to be down in the range of 2% to 4% on a reported basis and down 1% to up 1%, excluding foreign exchange. Industrial also has a higher proportion of revenues outside of the U.S. than Climate. So Industrial experiences more impact from FX as compared to Climate, 3 points adverse impact versus 2 points in Climate. For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring cost to get to adjusted margins. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 13.25% to 13.75%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 13% to 13.75%. And for the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.5% to 12% and EBITDA margins of 14.2% to 14.7%. Operating leverage would be about 60% all in and about 30%, excluding currency. Margin expansion would be 10 to 60 basis points on an adjusted basis. Please go to Slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $3.75 to $3.95. Excluding restructuring, the range is $3.80 to $4, an increase of 2% to 7% versus 2015.  As a note, for 2016, FX is a headwind of about 2% to revenue and $0.19 to earnings. For this forecast, we reflected consensus foreign exchange rate forecast. So for example, the euro average rate for the year is $1.03, but for the first quarter the euro forecast rate is $1.06. This reflects a full year tax rate of 24% to 25% and an average diluted share count of 260 million shares for the full year. As Sue explained, for ease of modeling, we allocated all excess cash to share buyback and phased it to the back half of the year when we turn cash flow positive. This does not to necessarily mean that this will be the actual deployment for the cash, but it was done to simplify modeling. The EPS outlook does not include the impact of divestiture of our stake in Hussmann, and we expect that transaction to close April 1 and result in a gain of approximately $400 million, which will be recorded in other income in the second quarter. We'll update our guidance in April to reflect the closing, but we'll adjust out the gain for comparability. First quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be flat to 2% on a reported basis and 3% to 5%, excluding currency. Reported first quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $0.28 to $0.33. Adding back $0.05 of restructuring will get to an adjusted basis the EPS range of $0.33 to $0.38. There are EPS bridges in the appendix for both the full year and the first quarter's guidance. For the full year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring cash and proceeds from Hussmann, of $950 million to $1 billion. As we said earlier, we increased the dividend last week and have already completed $250 million in share repurchases, which will offset more than offset dilution from equity issuances. We had $143 million of commercial paper at year-end. And after paying that down, it leaves about $675 million of cash for deployment that we utilize for the additional share repurchase or towards M&A. We continue to build a pipeline of acquisition opportunities related to our core businesses, and we weigh those risk-adjusted opportunities against buyback in terms of returns and shareholder value. In closing, we're pleased to have delivered on a solid year, with top quartile performance in revenue and earnings growth. Our strategies for growth and operational excellence have delivered a multiyear trend of excellent operating leverage, margin and earnings improvement. Our focus is to continue to grow earnings and cash flow through further implementation of these strategies. We practically work to deliver productivity and make prudent investments for the future. We continue to invest in new products and service offerings, our IT infrastructure and systems as well as further developing our people and our operating capabilities. We continue to execute a consistent, value-maximizing capital allocation program. So I'm proud of the progress we've made and results we've delivered, and I believe we're well positioned in 2016 to again deliver on our commitments. With that, Sue and I will be pleased to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Just a couple of questions. On the first quarter dynamics, you have a decent organic growth rate, but it doesn't look like there's much contribution from operations on EPS. What's going on there? Susan Carter : So Steve, good morning first of all. As we start to look at the first quarter bridge that you can actually see in the slides, what we're looking at is we've got restructuring costs that are in the first quarter. Our operating results are really going to be in the range of, and this includes the restructuring, negative $0.01 to a positive $0.04. We've got a little bit of lower share count. But when you think about what's happening in the headwinds, the first quarter is going to be part of that currency headwind that we talked about, particularly on the Industrial business. And the revenues we expect in the first quarter and margins for Industrial, we expect to be even lower than where we ended the year. So in other words, we're looking at a low revenue base. We're looking at headwinds from currency. And so I think the first quarter is just going to be tough compares, and then I think we get better as we go through the remainder of the year. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. So Industrial. That makes a bit of sense. On this gain, you guys are going to take -- Mike, given the environment has clearly gotten worse over the course of the last year, you guys are doing some degree of restructuring, but -- and you don't typically do this over time, like other companies, but any thoughts to may be using this gain to perhaps take a bigger swipe at things and get out in front of some restructuring that you may have planned for a couple of years into the future, just to kind of solidify that ability to kind of execute and deliver, like you've been doing over the last year? Is there a bigger restructuring out there, I guess, potential for that? Michael Lamach : Yes. I think, Steve, when you can go back to '09, we've been really consistent about particularly the factory footprint. And that's at a place right now where I think is very productive. It's well utilized. And when we look at ideas around that's coming to 2016, paybacks are in the range of, say, 5 to 8 years, which is just outside the range of what we thought in this environment was doable. That being said, when you look at areas of business, particularly around compression technology, there is restructuring taking place there and largely it's the areas of headcount and things that we can do on a non-qualified way. So tremendous focus on both corporate and costs within each of the businesses. So there is a sort of a drumbeat over time of doing that but it's an effective, efficient -- relatively effective and efficient footprint. One of the things that we find is the better we've gotten that in Lean, that further we've gotten into that, the longer and harder is to get a payback on a closure, which is a good thing. So we remain, I think, open-minded, Steve. If, in fact, things deteriorated further, if, in fact, we saw an opportunity, we certainly will look at that. We'll keep an open mind on that. But rather than putting a big placeholder out there with no specifics, we wanted to just keep it to the known actions and the announcements that we made internally inside the company to this point. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Just wanted to -- first of all, congratulations on great second half execution. Certainly, a lot better than many of your so-called high-quality peers. So well done on 3Q, 4Q. Just wanted to pick up on Steve's point about. Very clear answer on the restructuring. But I guess, the 2 areas of pushback for '16 plan would be flat Industrial and maybe flat TK. So I'm wondering if those come in weaker through the year, to what extent do you have contingency plans in place to mitigate the deleverage that you would see if those do come in weaker? Michael Lamach : Yes, Nigel, this is again,I'll pick it up at the point of Steve, where -- this is where investments would be metered down. A lot of the investments we're making are not only in product but in channel. And also letting attrition at times work for you. So we would continue to work that down. We certainly have a plan to sustain a lower revenue outlook, if we see that. It's baked within the guidance we've provided, the range that we've provided. And our focus really is on the Industrial segment, and it's fundamentally on the compression technology's piece. Todd's all over it. He's well into several months now into the role. I think he's got his eyes wide open around the opportunity. He's opportunistic around what he's doing. And I've got confidence in Todd and the team that they've got the plants hardwired for lots of different scenarios at this point. Nigel Coe : Okay, okay. Well, I'll pick up off-line. And secondly, obviously, you'd be aware that there's a pretty fertile debate about nonresi in North America, given the broader weakness in the industrial complex. The high single-digit growth in bookings during the quarter suggests that you're still seeing relatively fertile end markets, but maybe just pick up on where you stand and perhaps maybe comment on how the fundamentals [ph] are looking right now? Michael Lamach : Well, I think the surprise in the fourth quarter, at least to me, was the strength that we had both in Applied and unitary n North America. We had double-digit Applied bookings in the fourth quarter, and we had mid-teens booking in unitary in the fourth quarter. So as a backdrop, going into the first half of the year, it feels like we've at least got enough out there for us to see in terms of visibility to see that. Also, we had really good service growth, kind of high single-digit growth in services. Controls was up nearly double digits there. So it feels like we've -- call it a little bit of a lift in terms of institutional markets. Commercial hasn't turned down fully. That's why we're seeing good unitary, although some unitary spills in through K-12 as well. So that continues. And then, as you'd expect just the investments in the service network and service footprint have been good for us. So it's a pretty good backdrop from the fourth quarter going into the first part of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just a question around the Climate margin guidance. It looks like you're guiding for sort of 40-plus incremental margin in Climate for 2016 overall. Maybe looking at Slide 15, you might have some mix headwinds in that segment this year with resi growing so strongly, Thermo King and Trane Asia being flat to down. So just wondered what you're embedding for mix in Climate for the year ahead? Susan Carter : So Julian, as we think about where Climate's going to go in 2016, I think you're right, you hit some of the high points. So we still see the continued trends in what we talked about in terms of commercial HVAC in the Americas being strong and EMEA being up and on the Asia side being down a little bit. We called residential up mid-single digits. You also have the factors of Latin America as part of the business. And while you have some growth in -- those sides, you've also got the Transport revenues being flat in 2016. So I think it's all of those mix pieces could strengthen on the commercial side in North America and Europe, a little down on the Asia side. Flat Transport down on Latin America and good mid-single-digit growth in res. Julian Mitchell : Okay. So mix is sort of broadly neutral then, '16 versus '15, in Climate? Michael Lamach : Yes, Julian, residential, if you look at sort of the peer group, we're right at the top of the pack in terms of profitability. I think it's a point often lost on investors is the amount of margin improvement we had in residential businesses. So good residential growth, it's good for us. It's fine. On the Transport side, if you look at Transport North America trailer, the industry being down 10%, our guidance embeds more of a 15% decline. We look at APUs. We had good growth in the year. We had 16% growth in APUs over the full year. We had good growth in bookings in the fourth quarter. We've got a strategy for a higher attachment rate to non-refrigerated trailers, about a 3 :1 ratio. If we sell 3 APUs, it's equal to one North American trailer. So there is, between APU and some of the Air businesses and other businesses that we have within TK, the ability to offset that decline. And then I point you back to the fact that European trailer was up nicely. And as that moves up, that's actually even more helpful to North American trailer. So net-net, we're good. Actually, what's down for us pretty big is container. We had a big year last year in container. Container is soft market in general. We're against a tough comp. But container is an area, where, frankly, less container is helpful on the mix. So net-net, we think we can grow margins. Julian Mitchell : And then just a quick follow-up. Price mix -- sorry, price material was a 30 bps tailwind for the quarter and the year in 2015. Are you assuming sort of similar-ish for the year ahead? Susan Carter : We are. So if -- again, you're absolutely right with -- we ended the fourth quarter with 30 basis points and full year 2015 at 30 to 40 basis points. For 2016, we're going to expect a 30 to 40 basis point range for that gap or that spread between price and direct material inflation. You do have higher material deflation numbers. As you'll recall, we had inflation in the first and second quarters of 2015. So you do get a lift out of that. But I think as we think about the push and take between price and direct material inflation, we think all in all it's going to come back to about that the same 30 to 40 basis points range in 2016 as what we saw. One of the other points, and you didn't ask this, but I think it's relevant when we're having the discussion about price and direct material inflation, when we think about the differences between Climate and the Industrial businesses, the largest pieces of the benefit on material deflation do go to the Climate business. There is some, and there's still is a positive spread in the Industrial businesses, but it's much less than what you would see in Climate. And so as you're trying to come year-over-year, you also don't have that nice benefit coming out of commodities and the direct material deflation on the Industrial side. Operator : Our next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. David Raso : Couple quick questions. First, acquisition pipeline. Can you give us a little feel for where you're feeling the opportunities are presenting themselves most, be it geographic, end market, however you want to address the question? Michael Lamach : Really, David, the strategy for us has been to look at all the SBUs, core businesses across all markets. And so there's a pipeline that would reflect all that from that perspective. There are 2 fundamental areas that we see for investment. One is channel. We continue to see opportunities, whether it's geographically outside of the U.S. for channel or even in the U.S. in terms of buying back commercial distribution. That's a continued emphasis for us. We also find that when we can take a product, it might be a technology that we don't have and sell it through our existing channel, particularly on the Trane Commercial side, we do very, very well with that. So obviously, it's more attractive if we're buying anything that's euro-denominated or predominantly outside the U.S., and so we're pretty actively looking outside the U.S. for a lot of that, which can be then modified and brought into the U.S. with different power requirements and different efficiency ratings, but some of the technologies can be applied. So we're seeing an active pipeline there as well. David Raso : And given the balance sheet power and the cash flow, would you care to give us any sense of bigger than a bread basket-type sizing of what kind of size deals are you looking at currently? Michael Lamach : Yes, probably David, truthfully that would only get us into trouble, I think, to do any bread basket estimates. I think you can look at where we would end the year in terms of ratios, in terms of EBITDA to debt, we end the year around the 2.4x range. There's obviously some capacity within the current debt rating. We've got the cash. We talked about in the call the $675 million, that's unidentified. So there is an opportunity to do something a little bit larger. But what we're generally seeing are small to mid-size deals that just make great economic sense. David Raso : Okay. Couple quick things. Tax rate. With the IRS settlement now behind us, can you give us some guidance on how you think about the tax rate, be it this year, next year? I saw the tax rate guidance. I must admit I was looking for a little lower tax rate in '16, given the IRS settlement. But can you give us some guidelines how to model the next few years? Susan Carter : Sure. So we were probably a little conservative on the 24% to 25% effective tax rate guidance for 2016. I think that when you think about the IRS settlement, what the IRS settlement does is it takes the -- it takes the risk profile off the company, and it puts to bed all of the issues around intercompany debt and any issues that would have been in the 2001, 2002, through 2011 range. But what it really doesn't do is it doesn't really affect the overall effective tax rate. So what you have to do in order to make that tax rate move is you have to continue to refine your strategy. Now having all of those issues off the table certainly does give you an opportunity, and we are certainly involved in looking at that strategy in terms of the different areas that we're looking at. So we have a good trading hub that is in Europe. We're looking at Asia and Panama for trading hubs. We're looking at all of our intercompany debt and making sure that we're as balanced as we go into 2016 as we would like to be. But we do also have a slight headwind, if you will, on tax rates. And that is when you look around the globe and you think about our revenue growth in 2016, the areas that are growing the most are in North America, which does pressure the tax rate. So that's a long way around saying, we absolutely have a goal of looking at every opportunity to bring that rate down. We're still going to be just as conscientious about the items we take on as we've always been. But I do think we'll see some opportunities in 2016. We'll continue to work that strategy and continue to communicate. But like I say, it's also a good thing that we have a little pressure on that rate coming out of the North America growth. David Raso : All right. And speaking quickly on cushions just making sure, the corporate expense, I know there's rounding and you have to give ranges on segments and so forth. But it does seem to be implying your corporate expense goes up 10% to $230 million versus $210 million last year. Is that a rounding issue? Or should we really think the corporate expense is going up that much? Because if you back from the total EBIT, so it's implied by the segments, it is a larger number than I would've assumed. Susan Carter : Well, so it's not really rounding. But as we look at corporate expenses and -- so if you think back to 2015, where we started the year with our guidance, it was about $235 million, it may sound familiar, and we ended the year at $210 million on the corporate side. When we look at 2016, we took a lot of discretionary spend out of 2015. There are some investments that we need to continue to make around our IT infrastructure, around cybersecurity, and we also have on the corporate aside. So we talked about pension in total for Ingersoll Rand being about flat year-over-year. However, with a lot of puts and takes in elements of pension, pension is a little higher on the corporate side in 2016. So it's not just rounding, it's not just putting things back in, but I'll also tell you that we're going to be very conscientious about what that spend is. And looking at not getting ahead of ourselves on any spend before we see what's going to happen in the different markets. So it's a long way of saying that the $230 million, $235 million range is a lot more normal than $210 million, but we're going to watch it closely, and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that the money is spent very well and to the level that we need to. Michael Lamach : If you take the run rate plus the pension, you're right, it leaves little bit of a gap there, which we would normally apply to things like IT infrastructure and security that we're on a program to refresh. But look, if the markets turn down, we would just look to pull back, from a discretionary standpoint, in other areas in corporate. So there's a little bit of flex in there that we would take if the markets are a little bit rougher than we think. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Mike, you've often talked about one of the characteristics distinguishing marks of the new Ingersoll Rand. It's how you hold decrementals when volumes are in the down part of the cycle. So we're obviously witnessing that inside of Industrial or about to. Can you maybe talk about what decrementals you really think you're going to be able to achieve here if things do go a little bit further south? And what's giving you the confidence on just, I guess, down low single digits in Air and Industrial products when it looks like booking are a bit worse than that and the broader environment is also a bit worse? Michael Lamach : Yes. And Steve, look, a great example of that was what happened within a compression technology, if we take the legacy business, it ran almost flat on much lower volumes. So a great example of that. That was extraordinary effort by that team to really pull all the stops on productivity and discretionary spending, and really to win in the marketplace. It's a little bit tough to compare comps against competition, particularly denominated in different currencies. But we did fairly well there on the product and services side of the business. So that's a great example. I would say that where we try to leverage in the gross margin range of 25% and 30%, we're certainly looking to deleverage within the gross margin range of not to exceed to 25% to 30%. So that would be sort of the essence of that. It could depend a bit on the business. I mean, TK has fundamentally, I think, more opportunity. It doesn't leverage up nearly as high as people think. It doesn't deleverage nearly as poorly as people think largely because the distribution base of that business is independent. And so we're really turning on and off sort of factory production, and we've got very flexible plants and labor forces that work with us on that. So a great example is TK, where we would look to certainly work inside of normal margins in that business. Susan Carter : And Steve, just to add on to what Mike said on the Industrial side, when I step back and think about Industrial, I kind of think about 3 big buckets that impacted that. Again, no excuses, the decrementals need to be at the same level as the incrementals when we go forward. But Industrial has an outsized impact from foreign exchange. So over 50% of their revenues are impacted or they're non-U.S. and are impacted by foreign exchange. So you have that headwind going against them. We do have the amortization from the accounting on the acquisition of Cameron, again took that on -- knew we took that on, but it does impact what we're looking at in 2015. And then, as I pointed out earlier, when you think about -- they don't get the benefit or the big benefit coming out of direct material deflation with commodity prices because that's just not how that segment works. The Air business gets benefit out of some of that, but the other businesses within the segment do not. And so when I say you've got outsized foreign exchange, less direct material deflation, and we put an acquisition in there with some additional amortization. So I think about that in the total equation, too. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then as a follow-up to an earlier question, you talked a lot about the price versus material deflation and range spread, but a little more on the pricing environment itself, absent material. What are you seeing in your big businesses in pricing? What kind of behavior are you seeing? Michael Lamach : Well, both businesses in the fourth quarter saw positive price, which is pretty outstanding, frankly, across the board. And that's with pressure in Climate in Asia, and it's, of course, with Industrial pressure all over the world still able to get price in that business. So we are still seeing positive price, albeit it's pretty thin in the quarter. So that's, I think, a good indicator from the pricing power, and just sort of the pricing structure within the industry holds pretty well through tougher times. Susan Carter : And that same would hold for 2016, with both segments projecting positive price for 2016. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with the Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Just back to Industrial for a moment, Mike. Just thinking about the margins sequentially, if Cameron hit its targets and with a sequential revenue that you just had seasonally, I would have thought the margins would have been a little been better there. Can you just kind of walk us through that? And then just help reconcile us a little bit how we get comfortable with kind of a flattish Industrial for the year coming off this Q4 order number? Is there something in particular that you see in the pipeline that gives you some confidence in that number? Michael Lamach : Jeff, I'll start, and then I'll let Sue finish that. What I think a lot of folks don't recognize when we talk about Industrial is impact that Material Handing and tools would have. Material Handling is really exclusively oil and gas for us. It's 7% of that segment. It's been hit incredibly hard. In fact, the tools business was hit very hard by that business as well, the highest margin businesses in the portfolio. And so when those go down, you feel it. It's a substantial headwind buried inside the segment numbers that's independent of what's happening with Cameron or compression in general. The other thing, if you go back to compression technology specifically is we did very well from a margin perspective historically in Asia and in Latin America. And so from a mix perspective, when those markets are down and they've been absolutely clobbered, we feel that as well from a mix perspective. Susan Carter : Right. And so let's talk about the ECC business for just a little bit. And so I think the overarching point that we wanted to make when we were talking about that business is that it was EBITDA and EPS accretive, which is where we had hoped to go. However, I would say that as you look at that business from the time that we looked at the acquisition until we completed 2015, I would say that, that road map, just like we talked about with the entire company, has a few different components. So if you think about the revenue side of that business, you certainly have the 4 components of the business with the plant air side of the business being really hit by the weakened Industrial market. And so that definitely, that book in term business differently took a downturn in 2015. You also have tough, tough markets with oil prices and so on the processed gas side and on the engineered air side, you've got fewer projects, you've got same number of competitors. And so you've got some tough markets there and then you've got an aftermarket, which is an opportunity. Having said all of that, what we did with the business in 2015 with a top line that wasn't perhaps as strong as what we wanted is, we accelerated some of the synergies in the business and, in fact, overdrove the operating synergies, not revenue synergies, but the operating synergies in the business, and we're going to continue to do that. So the point wasn't that it's operating exactly as we would have called it a year ago, but I think as we look to the business and with what we were going to do with it, we ended up with a pretty good result on the acquisition. Michael Lamach : Yes, Jeff, too, you know lost maybe in this is some really strong execution here by the team integrating it. It will turn out that the synergy is going to be about 15% of Cameron's revenues. So it's double the synergies we thought we would have, which is a good thing because obviously, the top line is much weaker, and that's the reason it's still accretive from an EPS -- cash EPS perspective in the year. Jeffrey Sprague : Just one housekeeping item. The release says there's $250 million of repo in Q4 and $250 million in January. That $250 million in Q4 is really referring to a full year number, correct? Or is there some settlement issue with or something else that I'm missing there? Looks like you did $233 million through 9 months. Susan Carter : [indiscernible] I think it was October, and we had some settlement in December. So back in October we said we had spent, I think, $233 million to $250 million by the end of October. Did you catch that? Jeffrey Sprague : Not completely, no. Susan Carter : Sorry. We were talking in other response in the room, and I apologize for that. So we did do the $250 million in the fourth quarter. We talked about that roughly in the third quarter call, and then we had a separate 10b5-1 program that repurchased $250 million in January. Michael Lamach : So $250 million quarter 4 and $250 million quarter 1, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : All right. I'll follow up. It says $233 million in the Q3 10-Q. That's why I'm confused. Susan Carter : That's right. So what happened there, Jeff, and so you're absolutely right. At the time we released earnings for the third quarter, which would've been the third week in of October, we had not settled out the entire $250 million. So there was a little bit of leakage that was over into the remainder. But it was in October -- it was an October event. So in other words, we were announcing that we had gone into the market just like we did -- we are now. We're not talking about the first quarter. But in the first quarter, we've repurchased that $250 million. We had repurchased $233 million in October, and the total was $250 million for the fourth quarter. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. Got it. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Andrew Krill : This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. So going back to residential HVAC, I was hoping you can give a little more commentary on the mix of new buying versus repair. And have you seen any change in behavior there? And I guess, any margin implications this might have? Michael Lamach : Well, clearly, we're seeing more that's not so much new construction and repairs. It's largely new construction and replacement. And so it's moving back now toward replacement. Replacement is a very good place for us. We've got really good shares as compared to new construction where shares were lower. So when the market moves toward replacement, we generally do much better, and you saw that in high-teens bookings in the fourth quarter, and the overall good performance that we had in 2015 where we had really excellent performance in '15. Andrew Krill : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you could give little more color on China just by segment, and then also you touch on VRF trends? Michael Lamach : Yes, China, it's still rough. We're not seeing great progress in China in either business. Having said that, we're somewhat in a trough, and we did see it dip further in the quarter, in quarter 4. We saw great strength outside of China. So Singapore, Thailand, India really sort of, Hong Kong, kind of made the day for us relative to Asia. So nice to see those markets finally recovering on that front. VRF continues to do very well for us, continues to grow at or above pace of our unitary business. And we continue to have a very high share in North America, parts of South America in the VRF business. And I think, as you know, we don't play a big role outside of those territories. We play small role in China, largely in commercial VRF or in hybrid systems. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Mike, in terms of the acquisitions and the currency impact on Industrial this year, I think it seems like every quarter they've been almost 200 basis points. Maybe Sue can provide us the split of what that was for '15. How much was the acquisition impact? How much was currency? And then next year, I'm assuming the acquisition kind of impact year-over-year goes away, but you still have currency. Maybe help us with how those headwinds change? Michael Lamach : It's split about 50-50. And in '15 it was about 1 point above. So translational and transactional would have been about 1 point and acquisitions would have 1 point of headwind. Shannon O'Callaghan: And for '16? Michael Lamach : No acquisition headwind. Everything is based -- based on the calendar, it was all 2015 start and finish. So there's nothing there. On the FX side, it's going to be, again, a pretty tough road to hoe, probably 4 points of headwind coming into revenues, and we'd see sort of normal leverage against that. So it's probably 30, 40 basis points coming at us on that front. Susan Carter : Right. And to your question on the full year of 2015. So the overall operating margins were down 140 basis points. And the math would work out roughly the same if you took out the foreign exchange and the acquisitions that, that would see the majority of what the decrement was in the overall operating margin percentage. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay. And then as you think about eventually getting this business will get passed a lot of the focus, obviously, currently on this call about near-term Industrial weakness, but you do have this target you want to eventually get to the '17 and '19, and now Todd's in place the Air business. I mean, what are the -- other than kind of cost takeout to deal with the tougher current volumes, I mean, what are the key things you think you need to clear in order to get this to be a higher-margin business a few years out? Michael Lamach : Well, material Handling piece, Shannon, probably hit for 1.5 point, maybe up to 2 points right there. So I think really an underestimation as to what the impact would be across the segment of the Material Handling business. So add 1.5 point there. Figure currency at least stops moving against us at some point and flattens out. That's going to be helpful to us. And then any kind of volume we see there, we'd be leveraging that at 30%, 35% on that front. So there's been very solid productivity in that business, as I mentioned, particularly as it relates to the integration work and the back half work once we saw the revenue outlook deteriorate for 2015. So it's not a productivity issue. It's, again, you look at a business like Material Handling, small business, that sort of an impact. You look at currency, which they get not only translational, but there's a much larger transactional component there where it just doesn't make sense for us to of too many factories at the machining and so on and so forth. So if you're putting in the wrong part of the world, it's hard to move those, and you're going to absorb some of that headwind for a while. Hey, listen, I think that we'll update you when we're together in the Analyst Meeting. Todd will truly be in that seat and give you a point of view on that and then Robert Zafari will clearly tell you kind of the other pieces of this as well, which have a material impact as they are very high margin businesses. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Robert Barry : I think that this has been asked a little bit already but maybe just to put a finer point on some of the earlier questions about the Industrial assumption for flat growth given the orders have been decelerating. Just maybe some color there on what's driving that expectation? Michael Lamach : When you look at the 2009 and we saw customers abandoning equipment, shutting plants, we're not seeing that in '15. We're unlikely to see in '16. We're seeing customers that are just reducing CapEx. And so you're not seeing large machines, as an example. Now large machines, both Cameron and existing Ingersoll Rand, we're about 10% of the total business. Now we'll see parts and service probably in the mid- to high single-digit range next year as these older systems need to be maintained and serviced. And we even saw that begin to materialize in the back half of '15. So again, 10% of the compression technology business being big machines, 45-ish percent being services, and then, remember too, you've got Club Car, the tools and the fluid business, which would be a tailwind. However, Material Handling will continue to be a headwind, again, going into '16 there. So net that all out and the best view we have is that, that math works to about negative 1 :1. Robert Barry : Got you. That's very helpful. And maybe just kind of a quasi housekeeping question on the Hussmann adjustment. I think you talked about $55 million from Hussmann in asbestos. I think those 2 items through third quarter were just under $30 million. So is there like a big Hussmann 4Q? Or maybe can you just unpack that a little bit? That would be helpful. Susan Carter : No. The Hussmann results in the fourth quarter were fairly normal with what they've been throughout 2015. So that really didn't have an impact. It was right on where we would have guided at the end of October. Michael Lamach : We'll look at what you're talking about though and we'll follow back up if there's more to that question. Operator : And our final question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski : A lot of my questions have been answered. So maybe just the first one. On the price-cost spread that you laid out there, Sue, if I think about how that pertains to Climate and throw the majority in there, am I to assume kind of normal volume leverage to that in the mid-20s? Is that what you guys are essentially guiding to? Or am I missing something? Susan Carter : No, I think that would be a good assumption. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Okay. And then just a follow up. I know we've kind of beaten the Industrial mega trend discussion to death. But thinking about Cameron backlog, presumably coming into '16, that's a little bit lower, probably particularly low in the first quarter given that the -- that is more of a 4Q weighted business. Is that something that is contemplated in guidance? How should we think about that as maybe a headwind to the broader reading out of just comps getting easier in some of that resource industries and the service piece being an offset? Michael Lamach : Yes, Josh, no doubt we're going to see weaker big machine revenues that's forecast into what we're doing. What we found here and as an operator of the business is that the pricing and margins on that big stuff is not very good. It's really around the service and longevity of those systems over time as opposed to sort of the impact on sale on a quarter and in delivery. So really what we need to make up there in the weakness is service parts. And some of the smaller machines, including oil-free and segments of the market that will continue to grow like pharmaceutical, food and beverage in markets, where it's more consumer-driven, say, than it would be through heavy industry. Operator : And I now like to turn the conference back over to Janet Pfeffer for any closing remarks. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, operator. One thing I wanted to just clarify, I was a little far away from the mic, and so on share repurchase, we completed the $250 million buy in the fourth quarter, $233 million of it was in -- completed as of the end of September, the remainder completed out and settled in October just so to avoid some of the folks any confusion on that, I wanted to clarify that. And Joe and I will be around for your follow-up questions today. Everybody, have a good day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

And that's also where you'll find the slide presentation that we'll be referring to this morning. The call will be recorded and archived on our website. If you would please go to Slide 2.  Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements that remain pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from anticipated. And our release also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. And to introduce the participants on this morning's call, Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Sue Carter, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Joe Fimbianti, Director of Investor Relations. Please go to Slide 3. And I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Janet. For those of who that don't know, that's Janet's last time she'll need to read the safe harbor statement. She's retiring at the end of this month after a brilliant career here at Ingersoll Rand. We're going to miss Janet greatly. And Janet, we want to wish you and Ron [ph] all the best in your retirement. Janet Pfeffer : Thanks. Michael Lamach : So with that, we delivered a very strong quarter that exceeded EPS guidance and reflected excellent execution across the whole company. The quarter really demonstrated the consistency we're seeing in our strategy, which is to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, and I'd highlight a few areas here. First, we're leading in our markets in the innovation and development of energy-efficient, reliable and sustainable products and services. Second, we're deepening the penetration, the maturity of our operating system, and we're delivering operational excellence across our businesses. Third, we're maintaining a disciplined and dynamic approach to capital allocation. And finally, as I've said before, critical to any sustained culture transformation, our employees are engaged. Their scores are continuing to increase across the company. Employees continue to see Ingersoll Rand as a great place to work, which in turn leads to a better customer experience, and that ultimately delivers shareholder value.  Our performance in the first quarter gives us confidence to raise our full year guidance, essentially flowing through the first quarter operational beat [ph]. Now this morning, I'm going to give you an overview of what we're seeing in our end markets across the globe and use the opportunity to talk a bit about how we're performing against this market backdrop to give you some color on how we're progressing for the year. I thought it'd be useful to highlight where our performance maps specifically to our overall strategy. And then I'm going to turn it over to Sue, and she'll take you through the quarter and our revised guidance for the remainder of the year. So over the past 16 weeks, I've spent the majority of my time on the road with leaders across the company, and during that time, I've met with customers from many of our business units across vertical markets and regions of the world. I've spent considerable time with our customer-facing employees, from service technicians to sales teams. And as always, I've spent time inside our operations talking with the people who are building and engineering our products, to gain their perspective on the maturity and momentum in our operating system. And I've witnessed good momentum in the deployment of our operating system and remain confident that there is still a long runway of opportunity in front of us. With that, let's go to Slide 4. And I'm going to note that all of my comments are on an organic basis. So they're going to exclude currency and acquisitions. Now I'll turn first to the North American Climate segment, where our business remains strong overall, and we expect this momentum to continue for the balance of the year. In commercial HVAC, recent put-in-place data continues to support mid-single-digit growth, and we believe this should continue through at least 2017. We continue to see strong growth in the retail and office markets. Within the institutional markets, education and government markets are also strong. We saw a low-teens revenue growth in the quarter, coupled with high single-digit bookings growth. I want to point out, too, that we expect to see a record for quarter 2 with commercial HVAC North American bookings, which should be up approximately 25% over quarter 2, as a result of some large institutional project awards. We expect to continue to outperform the overall market for the balance of the year. Additionally, we're executing well on the volume and saw excellent operating leverage in the quarter. Growth here is a direct reflection of the constant investment we've made over the past years. And we're seeing growth specifically in the areas where we have invested, whether in product growth teams, products or channel. As in 2015, we are beginning quarter 1 of '16 with double-digit growth in our Controls and Service business. With over 4,300 companies direct service mechanics and technicians, we believe we are now the largest provider of mechanical HVAC service to commercial customers in the world. Additionally, when we break out our critical growth programs from the base business, we are seeing mid-teens growth in these programs.  Overall execution has been excellent. With clear discipline, the management team is running the business through our operating system. Like commercial, our residential HVAC North American business is likely to continue to outperform the market as well. We're proud of this performance and what's ahead for this business. I'm occasionally asked, \"What do investors misunderstand about Ingersoll Rand?\" and in reading some of the sell side reports, I think there is some misunderstanding about the success we've had in the residential HVAC business, and so I want to lay out some of the facts for you.  According to AHRI data, we have increased share each quarter, over the past 6 quarters, including the first quarter of 2016. For all of 2015 and continuing into quarter 1 of '16, we have a residential HVAC business with mid-teen EBITDA margins, which makes it accretive to the segment and IR as a whole. Quarter 1 brought mid-teen bookings growth for the second consecutive quarter and mid-single-digit revenue growth and very strong operating leverage. Our market outlook remains positive. We forecast 4% to 5% unit growth for the industry, and we anticipate our revenue growth to be in the high single-digit range for the year.  The residential team has done an outstanding job implementing our operating system across its full footprint. The team is running the entire business in a full product growth value stream, and it's showing in the execution. And strategically, we've executed well on our complete product refresh, repositioning of our channel strategies and in our connected home strategy, where we have a profitable business platform, robust diagnostic capabilities and nearly 200,000 Nexia enrollments to date. Additionally, connected home is a key driver of our residential controls business, which has more than doubled since 2011 and continues to grow at around 25% annually. Shifting to North American transport refrigeration markets. As usual, the management team did a great job in the quarter and managed to improve their margins with high operating leverage. North America continues to hold up well, especially in the truck and trailer market. Our current view of truck and trailer has improved from our original view of the market from earlier this year. ACT raised its trailer units forecast to 47,000 units, which is up about 1% versus last year. Their prior forecast was for the market to be down 10%.  We view this market data as being a bit aggressive, but we have raised our own forecast for approximately 45,000 units. And you may recall that our own prior forecast was 39,000 trailer units. So even though we do expect the market to be down over the record performance last year, our view has improved from when we spoke in February.  Our truck refrigeration business is also solid, and the overall market for Class 3 to 7 trucks is showing moderate growth. And we continue to pursue growth strategies in rail, bus and auxiliary power units to continue to balance North American business into additional vertical markets.  As we look toward the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, we plan to continue to outperform the market in the year ahead, with additional new product and service launches planned in the year and excellent management teams executing on the ground, delivering good margin expansion and cash conversion growth. We continue to do very well in Europe with organic bookings in the high single digits against a flattish market backdrop. We are seeing excellent uptake on the new product introductions, and like North America, the Service business also grew at a double-digit rate.  I visited our FRIGOBLOCK team and operations a few weeks ago. The progress made and the adoption of our operating system was absolutely amazing. With our FRIGOBLOCK acquisition, we've taken a step forward now in integrating hybrid electric technology into our product roadmap. The acquisition has been a great success for us.  Middle East markets are certainly softening. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned and would expect this to continue for some time, as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback. Moving to Asia Pacific, it's difficult to know if markets have reached an inflection point in China. The data is mixed, and it's not that consistent month-to-month. Our performance, though, has been deviating from the market in a positive way due to investments in products and the focus we've put on in increasing our direct channel marketing investment to achieve fuller market coverage. Climate bookings in China were up mid-single digits in quarter 1 and up low teens for Asia Pacific as a whole.  Our strategic focus on growing the Service business continues to be successful in Asia, too, achieving a mid-teens growth rate in the quarter. We're also seeing strong mid-teens bookings growth in transport refrigeration equipment as the market continues to grow. And our local engineering and manufacturing teams continue to tune the product to local preferences.  Strong growth outside China is being driven by growth in Thailand, India and our performance in Singapore, along with good transport refrigeration growth in Australia. So concluding the HVAC and transport refrigeration geographic update will take us to Latin America, where markets remain very volatile, with strength in smaller but fast-growing markets in the Dominican Republic and Panama but deteriorating conditions in Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina. Conditions though in Mexico remained fundamentally sound. Organic revenue for the region was flat, with low-teen increases in HVAC equipment. So we're pleased with our performance in the market. We've expanded margins in a very tough and volatile Latin American marketplace. Let's move to Slide 5. And here, we'll look at the end markets for the Industrial segment of our business, and I'll start with an overall comment that our compression technologies business bookings and revenue were down organically low single digits in the quarter, with equipment essentially tracking the overall market, but with service up mid-single digits. Again, we are focusing on growing our service businesses across the enterprise and have been executing well on that strategy.  In North America, U.S. manufacturing capacity utilization remains relatively low, hitting 75% last quarter, which is the lowest point over the last 12 quarters, and large equipment CapEx, typical for what we would see for large centrifugal and large rotary air compressors, historically rebounds the utilization readings above 80%.  On one visit, I had the opportunity to meet with a major customer that's been around for decades, building small-scale LNG plants that range from 50,000 to 500,000 gallons per day. I asked this Ph.D. physicist what the most reliable leading indicator he would look for in his end markets, and he responded very simply by saying, \"It's when the telephone rings.\" And fortunately, he did say the phone is beginning to ring, as is ours, in that area, but whether it's small-scale LNG systems or larger air compressors, our sense is that even early activity in large machine quoting activity probably will have little impact on large machine deliveries in 2016. To give you a little bit more color on this for the North American market, you look at compressors between 500 and 400-plus horsepower, the market for small compressors, those between 5 and 15 horsepower is up roughly 10%, but compressors larger than 250 horsepower are down more than 30% in the first 2 industry-reported months of the quarter. The small air compressors are quicker book and turn, with inventory restocking occurring in that category. We also believe we are seeing some restocking to the wholesale channel in our tools and fluid management business.  But our Material Handling team has done a great job managing their business, essentially holding the business to breakeven on a 50% reduction in revenue. So again, across the business, with the management team doing a very good job, exhibiting strong cost control and execution discipline on the backdrop of continued declines and projected global market growth.  In Europe, we're seeing increased exports and industrial production across Western Europe. Eastern Europe continues to be fairly weak. And for Asia-Pacific, the current environment continues to experience pricing pressure across the region, but we're cautiously optimistic to see if we have reached an inflection point, as manufacturing indices signal pockets of improvement in countries such as China, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, and China's power consumption has also shown growth in the first 2 months of the year, and India is seeing strong market growth in verticals like textile, pharma and food and beverage.  So rounding out the geographic update for Industrial segment, we'll go to Latin America, where volatility in the markets there across the region continues to be driven by political instability, and this has contributed to reduced investment in key verticals such as energy, oil and gas, mining and metals. However, other verticals like food and beverage, pharma and textile remain with positive outlooks.  So before turning it over to Sue, let me conclude by saying again we had an excellent quarter. We continue to invest in the products, service offerings and footprint of the company while using our operating system to deliver well above industry average results. And I'll turn it over to you, Sue, to cover the financial review and guidance. Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 6. Let's begin with an overview of the first quarter. Q1 was a strong operational quarter across all of our businesses. As you heard in Mike's comments, end markets continue to be strong in Climate and weaker than expected in Industrial. Our business operating system guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment. Our results show that we did not let cost get ahead of revenues in the quarter. Revenues grew slightly on a reported basis and were up 2% organically. The Climate segment grew 4% organically. Industrial was down 5%, both on a reported and an organic basis. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by commercial and residential in North America. Revenue in our Industrial businesses declined in the quarter with tough comparisons to the first quarter of 2015. Large centrifugal compressors and other industrial equipment were weaker than our estimates, but Club Car performed as expected, with low year-over-year growth.  Our adjusted operating margins grew 140 basis points year-over-year, with organic operating leverage of 75%. Adjusted segment margins grew 150 basis points, which shows the alignment between our operating performance and our Q1 results. Our strength was in price, direct material deflation and mix.  Earnings per share grew 32% year-over-year, exceeding our prior guidance. In Q1, our capital deployment actions, including -- included repurchasing $250 million of shares, and we increased our dividend by 10%. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016. All impacts will appear in the second quarter. Please go to Slide 7. I've included a slide to reconcile our Q1 EPS actual results with our prior guidance. I've said on a few occasions this morning that our results were the result of good execution and operational performance. Price and direct material deflation were the largest drivers of the margin expansion in Q1. This is an area where everything went right in the quarter; i.e., there was no breakage, price was positive in both segments and direct material deflation was also very positive to our guidance. Cost savings and controls were a positive $0.03 for the quarter. Each of our businesses and corporate functions had favorable variances to start the year as we controlled spending while we evaluated our end market volatility.  Currency, share count and other income were about $0.01 each. We opportunistically repurchased shares earlier in the year than we would normally, and currency was a bit favorable to our guidance range. Restructuring was favorable to our guidance by $0.03 for the quarter. This is timing. We have identified projects to execute and continue to work on restructuring projects that have good returns and shorter paybacks, and we'll spend the remaining $0.03 throughout the remainder of 2016.  Please go to Slide 8. Orders for the first quarter of 2016 were up 4% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, led by high-teens growth in North America unitary and double-digit growth in Asia applied.  We continue to see excellent growth in service controls, contracting and parts, with double-digit growth in the quarter. Originally, for commercial HVAC, we saw high single-digit booking increases with a high single-digit increase in North America and Europe; up low teens in Asia; and with declines in both the Middle East and Latin America. Residential bookings were up 17%. Organic transport orders were down low single digits with low-teens growth in truck and trailer in North America and Europe that were offset by lower container orders. Orders in the Industrial Segment were down 5% organically. We saw a low single-digit order decline in compression equipment, a low-teens decline in other industrial products and a mid-single-digit decline in Club Car. Performance in compression technologies was mixed in the first quarter. We had an improvement in small compressors, oil-free and in some of our component businesses, like dryers and filters. We also had a small improvement in our aftermarket business. These gains were offset by declines in core industrial compressors and by large centrifugal equipment.  Please go to Slide 9. This slide provides a directional view of our segment performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 4% in the first quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and flattish growth across Europe, Latin America and Asia. The Middle East was the only region that declined within the Climate segment. We're seeing a contraction in the number of building projects planned in the Middle East and would expect this to continue for some time, as lower oil prices are driving an investment pullback.  Our Industrial Segment performance in the first quarter, which was down 5%, is representative of the volatility that continues across the globe in the industrials market. Strong performance in Mexico contributed to double-digit growth in Latin America. We also saw growth in Europe, while Asia was flat and North America was down high single digits.  Overall, our regional performance for the first quarter trends with the end market summary that Mike provided us earlier, with a strong start in North America. Industrial Segment performance is expected to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through productivity gains and cost controls. Please go to Slide 10. Operating margin on a reported basis increased 160 basis points from 5.9% to 7.5% from the first quarter 2015 to the first quarter of 2016. Mix was favorable for the quarter 40 basis points, largely offset by unfavorable volume and currency. Net pricing versus direct material inflation was the largest driver of margin improvement in the quarter, favorable by 160 basis points. Price realization was achieved across both the Climate and Industrial segments, which was higher than expected, and commodities remain deflationary.  Productivity versus other inflation was positive 10 basis points, driven by ongoing productivity actions, partially offset by other inflation. Year-over-year investments in other items reduced margins by 20 basis points. In the box, you can see that was comprised of 40 basis points from incremental investments, 20 basis points from higher restructuring costs, which were partially offset by a 40-basis-point improvement related to the absence of acquisition-related step-up costs incurred in 2015. Overall, reported operating leverage exceeded 100% in the quarter, as we expanded margins in a low-growth environment.  Please go to Slide 11. Our Climate businesses had an excellent quarter in Q1. Adjusted segment income and EBITDA margins improved by 280 and 260 basis points to 9.8% and 12.4%, respectively. Increased volumes, favorable mix, price, direct material deflation and productivity offset other inflation and investment spending, the leverage for the Climate segment was 118% for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter were up 4% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by mid-teens unitary equipment shipments in North America and low-teens parts and service revenue in North America. Europe had low single-digit equipment growth and high single-digit services, contracting and parts. The Middle East had parts and services growth offset by declines in equipment sales.  Residential revenues were up mid-single digits in Q1, with very strong leverage and significant margin improvements. Transport organic revenues were down slightly, but this does not tell the whole story for Q1. North America truck and trailer organic revenues were up mid-single digits, and European truck and trailer organic revenues were up in the mid-20% range. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a soft start at various box builders for 2016.  Please go to Slide 12. First quarter revenues for the Industrial Segment were $681 million, down 5% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. Club Car organic revenues were up slightly versus prior year. Organic revenues in the Americas were down high single digits, while revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were down low single digits and were flat in Asia.  Industrial's adjusted operating margin of 9.8% was down 230 basis points compared with last year. Price and direct material deflation were positive. Productivity offset other inflation and volume and mix were unfavorable.  Please go to Slide 13. First quarter free cash flow of negative $46.3 million was favorable to prior year by $135 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 6.2%. We had strong collections in the quarter, with our days sales outstanding improving 1.3 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory's on plan for the quarter, and we're well positioned to serve our customers as we enter the heavier volume second quarter. Capital expenditures of $40 million are lower than prior year due to capitalization of our ERP systems cost in the first quarter of 2015.  Please go to Slide 14. Capital allocation is a key area of strategy for us. We continue to invest in our businesses, and I think you'll agree that our results show the value of our product refresh strategies and our operational excellence programs, which are a part of our business operating system. We raised the annual dividend 10% in early 2016, with a goal of maintaining a dividend payout consistent with our peers. We have an M&A pipeline that reflects our desire to add to our products, technologies and channels, as outlined in our strategy. We are focused on building long-term value. We bought shares to offset benefit program dilution in the first quarter at an average share price of $51.10. Please go to Slide 15. As always, our intention is to give you the best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. We also added a column to show you our current versus prior thinking on organic revenue. North American commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets have declined. We are forecasting transport markets in North America to be flat. Our forecast for North American trailer volumes has shifted from declines of 15% to down slightly for the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf cart markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. Both the growth forecasts shown here are on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, high single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all American -- North American business for us and a small increase in transport. We expect compression-related products and other equipments to be down high single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single digits. Please go to Slide 16. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our reported revenues for the full year 2016 to be flat to up 2% versus 2015. Overall, foreign exchange will be a headwind of about 2 percentage points. While these revenue outlooks do not show a total change, the segment numbers reflect important updates.  We expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. For the Industrial segment, revenues are forecasted to be in the range of down 4% to down 6% on a reported basis and down 2% to down 4% organically. For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get adjusted margins. We expect Climate adjusted operating margins to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%. We expect Industrial adjusted margins to be in the range of 12% to 12.5%. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.8% to 12.3%, a 30-basis-point improvement from our prior 2016 guidance and a year over improvement -- year-over-year improvement of 70 basis points. Operating leverage would be about 40% on an organic basis for the year. Please go to Slide 17. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.39 to $5.54. Excluding restructuring and the Hussmann gain, the range is $3.95 to $4.10, an increase of 6% to 10% versus 2015 and a $0.13 increase from the midpoint of our prior guidance range of $3.80 to $4. As a note for 2016, currency is a headwind of about 2% of revenue. This reflects a full year tax rate forecast of 24% to 25% and an average diluted share count of 261 million shares for the full year. Second quarter 2016 revenues are forecast to be up 2% to 4% on a reported basis and 4% to 6% organically. We are projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q2 and Industrial to decline mid-single digits on a reported basis. Reported second quarter earnings per share are forecast to be $2.75 to $2.80. Back out $0.01 of restructuring and the $1.49 Hussmann gain to get to an adjusted range of $1.27 to $1.32. For the full year 2016, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow, which excludes restructuring and the Hussmann proceeds, of $950 million to $1 billion. And with that, I'll turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments. Michael Lamach : Great. Thank you, Sue. And I'll be brief. As I started out this morning, we had a strong quarter. We improved operating performance in a volatile environment. We realized price in both segments. We achieved outstanding leverage and improved our cash flow. We're growing in the areas where we put a strategic focus. There's clear evidence the discipline we've created in our operating system is gaining momentum. And I'm confident in our management team, and we feel good about our forecast for the remainder of the year. So with that, Sue and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just on the price cost equation here. Clearly, a pretty strong contribution in the first quarter. Can you help us with how that dimensions out, just based on the purchasing agreements and hedges you already have in place, over the balance of the year? Susan Carter : Absolutely. So you're right. The 160-basis-point spread between price and direct material deflation was a strong start to the year. What we expect for the first half of the year is strong performance on a year-over-year basis, because last year, we were still in an inflationary environment in the first half of 2015. So I think the second quarter will be slightly less favorable than the 160 basis points, but what we've adjusted the full year to now, Josh, is 80 basis points of favorable spread between price and direct material deflation. And so the first half, second half reflects basically the year-over-year compares to last year. And then as we look at the 80 basis points, so Q1 performance was driven by strong price performance, and we expect some of that to continue in Q2 and also strong performance from the materials side. Price is one of those areas where, I think, you never want to reach out and assume that you can continue to get price at a great execution level throughout the year in a strong deflationary environment. But as opposed to the commodities themselves, here's what we expect. So we have about 70% of our copper locked in for the year through our contracts. We expect that copper and aluminum are going to be fairly stable in terms of what happens throughout the rest of 2016. You'll see some ups and downs. But generally, I think those are going to be pretty stable. We're seeing a slight uptick in steel, but I don't think that's going to impact us in 2016. Because of the way that our contracts are written, we wouldn't start to see that until the very end of the year. So I think our -- I think our supply base and our commodity teams have done a great job of getting us the deflation that you're seeing in the results. I expect that to continue. All of the Tier 2 pricing really seemed to come in Q1 also. So I think we had a great environment, and I think we'll have a great result. So if you recall, we had given you a look at the full year, I think, 30 to 40 basis points when we last gave guidance, and as I said, we took that up to 80 basis points favorable spread for 2016. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Great, that's helpful. And then, Sue, just as a follow-up, I remember last quarter, you talked about some of the toggles for the tax rate and specifically mentioned intercompany debt. Could you just maybe update us where we're at on the total tax strategy in light of some of the treasury rulings? Susan Carter : Right. So I think the first way to start out that question, Josh, is to say that we -- we've looked at all of the proposed treasury regulations, and we don't expect those regulations to have an impact on our effective tax rate in 2016. As we think about the tax strategy that I've talked about getting us into a low 20s type of tax rate on an ongoing basis, I also don't expect those regulations to have an impact on us getting into those areas. And the reason that I say that is when we're looking at our tax strategy, intercompany debt is one element of some of the things that you can do, trading hubs, procurement hubs, making sure that your transfer pricing is absolutely aligned and other tax efficient projects can help us get to where we want to go. We've also been looking at a project that helps us look at effective tax rates by each of our SBUs, so that we're all working on tax as we do our plans and we do our forward looks, and I think that will help us with an overall tax strategy that doesn't get impacted by the proposed treasury regulations. We'll obviously continue to look at those and make sure that we understand all of the sort of derivative impacts that might be out there from the regulations. But no impact on the rate and no impact on our strategy going forward. Operator : And our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : I guess my first question maybe starting on industrial, where you did see decelerating trends. I noticed that you didn't take up the restructuring at all for the quarter, and if I recall correctly, there were some Cam shipments that were expected to be released in the beginning part of this year. And so I'm just wondering, is there still opportunity for further action in Industrial? And what's the -- I guess, what's the strategy at this point? Susan Carter : Yes, Joe. So the $0.02 of restructuring that we spent in Q1 was related to Industrial. We are continuing to work on restructuring actions for the remainder of the year. And those are going to primarily be in Industrial. So we called out in the guidance about $0.01 for each of the next 3 quarters. I think what's important about the restructuring and the way that we've looked at it is that the restructuring really does have a payback within 2016. So we fully expect to realize the benefits of that $0.05 of restructuring. And that is also what will help us with my comment earlier in my prepared remarks about industrial margins improving in the back half of the year. So some of that productivity kicks in and some of the restructuring actions that were actually started almost a year ago are going to kick in. Now on the ECC [ph] side, we did have some shipments that had pushed out of Q4. We actually had some shipments that pushed out of Q1 also into Q2. But the ECC [ph] story is an interesting one. So if I look at first quarter bookings in total, bookings in total for the ECC [ph] business are actually up significantly in the first quarter. The majority of that is going to be in the products that are outside of the large centrifugal compressors. Those are really coming down. But -- so bookings are up, which is good. The revenues that we're seeing are really being impacted by the large centrifugals, but also importantly, as we think about ECC [ph] and that business is, we expect to really be on track with the revenue and the cost synergies for 2016 that we had outlined. So lots of moving pieces in the business, but I think you'll see some strength in the normal product and in the aftermarket and some bigger weakness and some shipments moving around in the large centrifugal compressors. Michael Lamach : Joe, remember, too, that I think that we've been [indiscernible] restructures now for years, and that's both qualified and nonqualified. So we're always improving the cost base there. When you look at the type of paybacks that we're seeing in that business, we're getting numbers like 7 years, which is indicative of doing a good job around running the plants, the utilization that we've been able to achieve in our plants. You couple that with the lead time to bring on new capacity when the markets return, and that's a 24- to 30-month process, particularly in the machining centers that we would be moving or upgrading to do that. So we don't want to get whipsawed in doing any large restructuring when this thing turns around, because the margins come back very strong when the business volumes come back as well. So we're being cautious. Now we're always looking at the ideas that are on the table. If the underlying real estate values change or if tax incentives change from one location to another, it could swing something like that. We are very cautious about looking at an upswing in the lead time to bring capacity on when you need it, and we don't want to ever be in a situation at an upswing in the market to not have sufficient capacity at that point in time. Joseph Ritchie : No, that makes sense, Mike. I guess, maybe my following question, I just want to make sure I heard this correctly. Did you say that 2Q North America commercial HVAC bookings are expected to be up about 25%? Michael Lamach : Yes, that's correct. Joseph Ritchie : And is that the reason for the organic revenue guidance raise? Michael Lamach : No, it's more of an impact in '17. It's got a little bit of a positive in '16, a little bit of a positive in '18, but the bulk of that would be '17 shipments. So it's really the strength of the business across the board. Unitary continues to be strong. The pipeline looks strong for us. Europe has been a great success story. I think it'll continue as well. So it's -- and, of course, the residential business continues to put up some very big numbers. And so all of that combined has got more to do with the guidance increase than the large booking number in quarter 2. By the way, quarter 3 should look pretty good for us as well. Although I don't have a prognostication on the percentage rate, it should be a good quarter for us. Operator : And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just wanted to say thanks a lot to Janet for all the help, and all the best. In terms of the first question, that would really be back on the Industrial margins. It used to be at sort of 16%, 17%, the odd-quarter here and there, down to 9% to 10% right now. And the guidance embeds that by the end of the year, I guess, they climb back into the sort of low-teens in the next 3 quarters. So maybe just help clarify what's driving that sort of 400 point plus margin recovery? Is it just about productivity? Or is there something going on with the mix as well of Industrial versus compression? Susan Carter : So Julian, great question. On the Industrial margins, your math is absolutely correct, that in the back half of the year, we do have the operating margins for industrial improving into the low-teens. And as we look at what's going to happen in that back half of the year, so it truly is productivity, still lower inflationary type of rates. So you've got productivity offsetting other inflation. You still have positive price in the back half of the year. And you have just a skosh more volume in the back half of the year than the front. I don't want anyone to think there's a lot of volume recovery that we've built into this. We have not. But there is, by virtue of how the quarters pan out, roughly $50 million of additional revenue in the back half versus the front half. But it's productivity. It is the restructuring actions that are kicking in, and it is the continuation of the actions that the management teams are taking to work through this low revenue and end market decline. Michael Lamach : It was also, Julian, the cost control there is exceptional. So even though you're seeing kind of a headline $0.02 restructuring. There's at least that much, maybe more than that, which would be nonqualified restructuring. So it's sort of restructuring in place, not replacing or controlling spending. So there is a cost of that in the first half of the year and a benefit to that in the back half of the year, which is broadly in line with Sue's productivity comment. But a big piece of that productivity is literally the cost control around headcount, some of which is qualified, some of which is nonqualified, in terms of how we would actually account for it. The longer-term question that you asked about the profitability of the business, Sue did a little bit of analysis on this, and it might be useful to kind of walk through where we -- when we would see a 17% margin in the business. Susan Carter : That's great. So when I looked at it, so the first thing that we did is we went back and said at the time that we gave the original 17% margin guidance for the Industrial business, the revenues in the business were in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion. If I look at where we're at today, we're roughly in the $3 billion type of territory. So I think as we look at the business, we're doing all of the right actions today to get the costs in line, but I think what we need is market recoveries and, I think, the revenues to return to sort of that upper $3 billion range for us to get into the 17% margins. We think that's doable, but I think the timeframe is really highly dependent on when the markets come back. Right now, we haven't seen -- the markets actually stop falling. So we need to stabilize first and then the markets to return. But again, I think the way I'm thinking about it is, once of the revenues get back up into the $3.6 billion, $3.7 billion area, where they were when we gave that guidance, that we'll be nearing those 17% type of margins for Industrial. Michael Lamach : Remember, when you look at the gross margins of that business and look at the fixed cost of that business, say, relative to the Climate segment, you can see very easily why that business snaps back very strongly on volume. So when volume returns to that business, we'll get very aggressive incremental margins out of that. In the short term, we're controlling the heck out of costs the best we can. However, we're not going to [indiscernible] as it relates to capacity. Julian Mitchell : And then just my follow-up quickly would be on your overall firm-wide margin bridge. Q1, you had about 10 points or 10 bps from productivity and other inflation. I guess, based on what you just said, should we think the number for the year ends up somewhere between that 10 bps and the sort of the 90 bps tailwind that you had last year for the year as a whole? Susan Carter : I do think that you will -- we do see other inflation to be higher in the first half versus the second half is when our salary increases take place. That's when a lot of the benefits take place. So when I look at what we plan for the full year, I would say it probably looks more like 40 to 50 basis points for the full year, Julian. Operator : And our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : So this North American order spent [ph] is really interesting, Mike. And I'm assuming that's really driven by these large pipe projects finally starting to break free, and I'm just wondering what's changed here. I mean, is it just a case of old equipment we're seeing here to the extent that replacement [indiscernible] coming through? Is it budgetary? I mean, any color there would be helpful. Michael Lamach : Yes, Nigel, I think all of that is true, but the constant, persistent investment we've made over 5, 6, 7 years in that business, the constant investment in the channel and the service footprint is really paying off. And I just think the focus we've had on all of that development being around energy efficiency, sustainability, new refrigerant development, all that is just such a powerful story when you look at it. This is what we were waiting for. This is what we'd hoped to have seen, which is outsized growth relative to the market and outsized profitability or margin expansion relative to the market. So this is a huge effort by lots of people, all the way through to the technicians providing service on the street for us. This is a real accomplishment. Nigel Coe : Okay. And obviously, very, very early to call '17 at this point, but if you just look at the North American commercial HVAC operations, based on the backlog of pipeline, is it reasonable to assume that perhaps you might see some acceleration next year? Michael Lamach : Well, the thing you have to think about, though, is what happens to the office and retail business. As an example, our national accounts business has been doing extremely well into retail. Office building is doing really well, as you can see, kind of the high teens booking rates again for unitary. That's been strong again. At some point, you think that, that would begin to subside and be replaced by stronger applied growth, which I think will happen. So I think what you end up with is maybe a change in the mix between unitary and applied, but I do think continued strong performance through '17. Operator : And our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JP Morgan. C. Stephen Tusa : On the Climate side, I mean, just a very big margin number, obviously. And I'm trying to just wrap my head around the seasonality dynamics 2Q to 3 -- 1Q to 2Q. In the last couple of years, you've had increases. Like in 2014, you guys saw a doubling or almost a tripling of the profit number in Climate. Can you just maybe speak to what you expect seasonally there or maybe just at a high level, what you expect for the margin in that business as we move through the year? And my guess is that seasonality is a bit muted because you're now seeing the onset of Commercial, which is a less seasonal business than some of these other things or just maybe help us square that. The first quarter base is just so high that I'm just having trouble kind of getting low enough in Climate? Michael Lamach : Yes, Steve. I think that looking at something certainly in the 16% margin range for the entire segment is going to make a lot of sense for us. Again, to Sue's point, price, I think, subsides a little bit. Material inflation kind of clips along pretty much at the same rate. Bookings look good. Pipeline looks fairly strong. We're not seeing -- the container business on the transport side being down, of course, is not all that problematic for us in terms of margins so long as European trailer and North American trailer are doing well. So if you put that all together, you're probably doing something in the 16% range. C. Stephen Tusa : Can you, at some point, soon, kind to get to that 17%? Will you kind of hit that at some point this year? Michael Lamach : I don't know. I mean, we haven't -- really looking at Q3 and Q4 at that level of granularity around guidance, Steve. I don't know. I mean, Q2 is seasonally a pretty good quarter for us. Quarter 3 can be. So we've got an outside shot at something like that. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then just on the kind of go forward leverage, so you've had this nice pop off the bottom on margins. Should we continue to expect that if this kind of current mix holds that if commercial HVAC does really continue to roll on here and we have a bit more of an extended cycle than, I think, most people were expecting probably 3 to 4 months ago? Can you still leverage that business really well? Or do you have to add cost or anything like that? I mean, I feel like you got to have plenty of capacity here to let it rip a little bit before you start to throw money at the business from a capacity perspective, right? Michael Lamach : Well, the service business and the controls business are growing so well, too. And our margins are obviously much higher. So it's a little bit distorting about how we might think about fixed cost being factory cost. I do think that there is some capacity we have even in our field service and controls capability that wouldn't require incremental investment. Obviously, it's feet on the street, but we stay in front of that, and we typically hire long in the Service business. So I don't see why having leverage for the quarter -- I'm sorry, for the full year that starts with a 4 would be a problem in the Climate business. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then one last quick one. You guys took up the price cost year-over-year by, I think, 40 bps, you said, but you only took your margins up by 30 bps. And anything, what -- is it -- that just volume at -- and mix at Industrial, is that kind of what's that moving part? Michael Lamach : Well, inflation kicks in, just in terms of wage increases beginning in April for the full year, and we tend to see sort of the cost increase there as well puts a little bit of a squeeze on margins there. But fundamentally, Steve, there's not anything really changing, other than the fact that it's hard to believe that price stays as high as it normally is, and material inflation should stay about where it is, but we're looking at just that -- closing that gap a little bit, probably from the price side. Operator : And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Mike, can you just elaborate a little bit more on kind of the booking strength? And was that a -- that 25% number, is that global? Or are you speaking to the U.S.? Michael Lamach : It'd be the North American commercial business. Jeffrey Sprague : North American commercial. It does sound like Europe, though, is fairly strong for you on share gain. How do you see that playing out over the balance of the year? Michael Lamach : Listen, I went -- probably, I saw 5, 6 of our factories and operations in Europe a month ago. I met with the engineering teams that saw product launching between August and December, Jeff. It's one of the best stories I've seen. Absolutely, the fastest cycle time between ideation and product launch. They're hitting it right on the money in terms of what the customers are looking for. It's been a great story for us. I don't see that stopping for us in 2016. I'm very optimistic, very proud of the work that's gotten done on the HVAC side in Europe. But I would also tell you, switching over to FRIGOBLOCK, FRIGOBLOCK was a family-run German company. If you put sort of a paradigm around that, you might think slow to change or difficult to incorporate on the operating system. What I found there was one of the fastest implementations of an operating system that we've put in place across the company. It's very exciting and the openness around that. And then, the openness of our transport refrigeration team to include that hybrid electric technology into the truck platform is also very positive. So I left Europe feeling very bullish. Jeffrey Sprague : And then could you address what's going on in 14 SEER, probably still early in the season to know for sure, but is that price gap versus legacy 13 holding in the 10% to 15% range? Susan Carter : Yes, Jeff. It is holding. And I think the great news about the 14 SEER is, what we saw was the balance of 14 SEER and greater product is still about 80% of the revenues in 2016. So we're seeing price. We're seeing the favorable mix that we expected out of the product, and we're also seeing that the balance between 14 SEER and even the 15 SEER and above has not really changed, which does create a good environment, as you alluded to with the price and cost differential. Jeffrey Sprague : So is that 40 basis points of positive mix, Sue, that you elaborated, all in residential? Did you actually have more than that in residential and it [indiscernible] somewhere else? Susan Carter : So it was not all residential. It was a combination of residential and also Thermo King. On the Thermo King side and one of the things that we saw was we saw more strength than we expected in truck and trailer, both in North America and in Europe. And then the big declines on Thermo King came from the marine container business that I said was down about 60%. So the 40 basis points of mix was primarily from res and from Thermo King, and it was -- my recollection is it was split pretty evenly. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Hammond from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Jeffrey Hammond : So what's driving the 1Q order growth in residential? And what gives you the confidence to kind of move that forecast up ahead of the selling season? Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, first and foremost, the product line really at this point has been fully developed. And we've hit stride on all the good success with the furnace product, all the good success with the new launches, the variable speed, growth in Nexia. All these things have just been really kind of coming together. Operationally, we just find the pipeline for projects and productivity and quality to be improving. Deliveries have been exceptional in terms of on-time delivery. And having product available where you need it, when you need it, really investing in the warehousing and investing in the product availability. So just a sense here that things have gone right for a long time here and that we'll do better, particularly as the mix moves up north of 14, which it has. So the mix moves more to 14 SEER, we do better anyway. And as the mix moves more toward replacement and away from new construction, we'll do better. Jeffrey Hammond : Okay, great. And then how's the M&A pipeline kind of informing how you're thinking about buyback through the balance of the year? Michael Lamach : There's no doubt we want to grow the company and grow value over the long run. So we said we're looking at ideas and businesses that we know and run and are successful with. FRIGOBLOCK and Cameron were great examples -- different examples, but great examples of being able to take businesses, put them into an operating system, improve the businesses and deliver essentially what we said we were going to deliver from an accretion perspective. So we feel good about our capability in doing that. We also feel patient. We feel like we don't have to -- we're not compelled to do anything around and M&A. We've got great positions in the marketplace, and there is not a compelling need for us to go to do something and -- potentially do something where we pay too much in that process. So Jeff, we'll continue to evaluate that. When we see opportunities that fit the criteria, we'll pull the trigger. And we clearly want to grow long-term value for the shareholder. And that's probably the best way to do it. With that being said, you couldn't pass up in January stock price dislocated 20% from the peer group. I mean, we jumped in on that and acquired $0.25 billion in January at $0.51 a share. So we're going to be dynamic, we're going to be opportunistic, and we're going to grow shareholder value. If that means we find the right bolt-ons to do that, we're going to jump on those, too. Operator : And our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Steven Winoker : And also appreciate the additional detail in the disclosure today. That's helpful. Let's see. So first of all, Mike, how are you reconciling all of this discussion about commercial HVAC strong growth relative to what is pretty lackluster Dodge data, ABI, all these macro data points. So are you attributing it to -- all to share, renovation, control, service? Just maybe a little clarity on that would be helpful. Michael Lamach : Well, it's sort of all of the above, Steve, which is probably hard to give clarity on that. But if you take Latin America, we're up mid-teens in Latin America. That's clearly our people out in the street creating demand, making it happen. Mid-teens bookings growth in Asia. I mean, Asia is not that strong. Again, our team is hitting the street. Europe, we talked about product development and the pace of product development. There it's best-in-class in the company. And product management, best we have in the company around getting it exactly right on these product growth teams and understanding where we're competing, how we're going to win against very specific competitors in the market. When these product's launch and they do exactly what they were supposed to do, that's a positive for us. So there's a lot of self-help here happening. And the backdrop on the markets, with the exception of the Middle East, isn't bad. So you've got decent markets and really strong execution. Steven Winoker : Okay. And how are you doing on -- what's the growth rate on VRF in the quarter progress? Any developments there? Michael Lamach : Last year, we were about 30% growth. This year, we're about the same, Steve. We continue to do well in the market. We continue to sell VRF. We're beginning to also see interest in what's referred to as 4 pipe chillers. So this simultaneous heating and cooling around water circulating through buildings versus refrigerant. It's big in Europe, picking up a little bit of interest in the U.S. The idea here is we're going to have whatever products are demanded in the marketplace, and then we're going to work with the customers to figure out what the best solution is for the building. And that's why our business was up 30% last year. It's why our business is up about the same this year as well. Operator : And that concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Janet Pfeffer for closing remarks. Janet Pfeffer : Thank you, and thank you, everybody. Joe and I will be available for follow-up calls later today. And it's been a pleasure to work with all of you. Have a great day. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Zac Nagle : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. This is Zac Nagle, and it's a pleasure to join you for my first Ingersoll Rand earnings call as Vice President of Investor Relations. Welcome to Ingersoll Rand's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. We released earnings this morning at 6 :30 a.m., and the release is posted on our website.

With that, please go to Slide 3 and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Great. Thank you, Zac, an official welcome to Ingersoll Rand and your first earnings call with us. As you can see from our earnings release this morning, we had another excellent quarter. We had outstanding execution across the company delivering 15% EPS growth, record operating margin, share gains and strong cash flow despite challenging industrial markets. We're seeing strong momentum in the operating system that we've been installing and developing in the company over the past 6-plus years. As we did last quarter, I'd like to start out spending a few minutes linking this quarter's performance to the longer-term strategic direction of the company to help investors understand how we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company over the longer term. Within our operating system, operational excellence and growth excellence have been cornerstones of the strategy from the beginning, with our goal of becoming the very best operating company within our diversified or multi-industry peer group. This quarter we continued to deliver best-in-class operating leverage of 47% and our goal is to achieve top quartile organic growth for the quarter and for the year as well. There were a number of noteworthy milestones that showed clear progress in these areas during the quarter. Our residential HVAC business had another outstanding quarter with record revenue and profitability. We estimate that over the past quarter and 12 months, we now have benchmark profitability in this business and are seeing the benefits of a 5-year effort to refresh the product line, align and reposition the channel and dramatically improve product management, manufacturing and supply chain. Our residential business is also a model for the deployment of product growth teams for delivering market share and margin growth. Our commercial HVAC business in North America had record second quarter bookings and revenue. Similar to our residential HVAC story, we have executed on a consistent strategy with the goal to have the freshest, most energy-efficient and reliable product line in the industry and have supported that with consistent operational improvements along the way. We continue to see double-digit increases in our controls business and high single-digit growth in our service business, consistent with our strategy to balance equipment with controls and services. In the second quarter, Trane Commercial led the industry with a strong pipeline of new high-efficiency products, many of which earn our EcoWise badge for innovation that improves energy efficiency as compared to legacy product platforms, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Examples this quarter include the North American announcement of the new CenTraVac centrifugal chiller portfolio using next-generation low global warming potential refrigerant. The product is for large buildings and industrial applications in the U.S. and Canada. We also announced a service program to retrofit the existing installed base to the next-generation low global warming potential refrigerant, which protects and provides a viable option for our customers' past investment, while achieving their own sustainability goals. In Europe, we announced another 4 new products, the Sintesis eXcellent [ph], a new air-cooled chiller with nearly 0 global warming potential using next-generation refrigerants. Airfinity, a complete new range of HVAC rooftop units designed to comply with the upcoming European Union EcoDesign regulations. They're light, compact and modular plug-and-play HVAC units that are compatible with wireless technology and designed to save time and money when retrofitting, and improve the efficiency of existing buildings across Europe. XStream, a new range of a water-cooled screw chillers now available in Europe and the Middle East. The efficiency and capacity ratings are unmatched by any other screw chiller in the market today. We hope this will become a preferred option for critical applications like data centers, hospitals, process cooling, district cooling and heating. And finally, Trane Balance, our second generation of innovative multi-pipe systems for high-efficiency simultaneous heating and cooling. The systems repurpose energy that's rejected and use renewable energy for heating. Within our Thermo King North America, Europe and Middle East business, we're demonstrating that we have a more resilient business than in the past, expanding margins 270 basis points in a low-growth environment. As we noted in our initial guidance, we believe that we could maintain or even grow margins with a 15% North American trailer pullback and flat overall volumes. Today, the Thermo King business serves the refrigerated truck, trailer, marine container, air container, bus and rail, telematics and auxiliary power unit markets. And the completeness of the portfolio has added to margins and the overall resiliency of the portfolio.  Also of interest, both our residential HVAC and Thermo King North America, Europe and Middle East business units have been fully deployed on the new ERP system for the past couple of quarters, and we believe we're now seeing the expected productivity throughout these business units. We continue to deploy new sites routinely in other business units each quarter. We continue to be pleased with the tremendous execution we're seeing in our HVAC and transport refrigeration business in Asia Pacific and in Latin America. Both regions demonstrated substantial margin improvement and share growth. HVAC bookings in Latin America were up 36% on an organic basis for the quarter, really outstanding performance by that team and that region. In Asia Pacific, our transport refrigeration business continues to grow with another 23% increase in bookings and 25% increase in revenue. Both are examples of finding pockets of growth within generally weak markets and then capitalizing on those opportunities. Turning to our Industrial segment. I want to start by saying that I have tremendous confidence in our leaders running these business units. They're operating in a very challenging environment. Within compression technologies in North America, it's our largest market for equipment, the 250-horsepower to 400-horsepower contact-cooled rotary market is down 20%. And all other size ranges are also down in the high single-digit range, with only small 5- to 15-horse compressors showing year-over-year growth. Against this backdrop, we're performing well and supplementing the business with service bookings of approximately 10% in the quarter. Remember, too, that the last time we emerged from down industrial cycle, we grew margins nearly 7 full points in a 24-month period.  Our Fluid Management business continues to perform well with modest growth, and we're seeing continued weakness in the tools business. And no sign of recovery in our Material Handling business, which provides hoist and winches for the oil and gas industry. Club Car continues to broaden its strategy and reach outside of golf with small electric vehicles in the commercial and consumer segments.  Turning to growth excellence, which encompasses the full value stream from strategic analytics, product management, new product and technology introduction, sales management and service and support, this has been another cornerstone to our long-term strategy. We believe the product, channel and service footprint investments we have made over the past 5 to 7 years are paying off. It's clearly evident in the HVAC and transport refrigeration business units. And we believe it'll also be the case for our compression technology business unit that has been doing a similar investment program over the past couple of years, which will continue over the next several years.  Even as industrial markets are challenging today, we continue the investment in the compression technologies business because we expect we'll be rewarded as the market recovers. As one example, one of the product growth teams operates in the compression technology business and covers a specific product portfolio, which equates to about 10% of the overall revenue of that business. Within the product growth team, we're seeing year-to-date bookings increases of 30% and revenues increasing by 17%. It's strength in our Climate segment, capacity utilization in our shared Climate and Industrial plants and operations and leveraging our technology teams, that's allowing us the opportunity to stay the course on critical growth programs in our Industrial segment. We have continued to invest in strategic growth programs across the company through both good and difficult times and the benefits of doing so are clear. Our designated strategic growth programs, many of which are managed through our product growth team process, are growing at a rate 3x faster than the underlying growth rate of the company. As another example, within the commercial HVAC business in North America, Europe and the Middle East, our strategic growth programs are growing at a 14% rate of this year. And for the company, 80-plus percent of our growth is coming from investment and focus on these critical strategic growth programs. So as is our model, we'll leverage the success and build and accelerate on the full deployment of this element of our operating system in the years ahead. Going forward, we see multiple investment opportunities to deliver long-term growth through innovation and differentiation of the product, software and services we provide. I don't think anyone on this call needs another presentation on the Internet of Things on the possibilities for how that will transform competition and opportunity. This macro trend is squarely centered on nearly every growth and productivity strategy in our company, whether it's connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and service, diagnostic and self-healing systems, telematics, consumer marketing and fulfillment and too many other digital concepts to list. We're funding a number of these ideas centrally within the corporate expense line and are likely to accelerate this incubation investment later this year. Incremental 2016 investment for this activity is already embedded in our guidance. Finally, building on the culture element of our model. High-quality teams and deep employee engagement are critical to any sustained transformation, and I'm pleased that we continue to excel in these areas. One source of great pride within Ingersoll Rand is our ability to walk the talk on sustainability. To make a point, we continue to see benchmark levels from employee engagement; world-class safety performance for any segment of industry; energy reduction of 5% on an absolute, not volume-adjusted basis; a 14% reduction in water consumption, also on an absolute basis; and similar reductions on both hazardous and nonhazardous wastes. So Sue will take you through the quarter in detail. I felt it was important to align how today's results reinforce the strategy of the company, how we intend to get delivering great results and why you should believe we're building a more valuable, sustainable and less cyclical company for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Sue. Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 4. This is a summary slide that I like to begin with and give you some takeaway from today's call. As Mike has discussed, Q2 was another strong operational quarter for us and it shows through the financial results that we posted. In the second quarter, we drove year-over-year organic revenues higher by 3%, adjusted margins up 80 basis points with a leverage of over 45% and adjusted earnings per share up 15% against the backdrop of a very slow-growth environment and particularly challenged industrial markets.  Adjusted earnings per share of $1.38 exceeded our guidance range of $1.27 to $1.32 by $0.08 at the midpoint and $0.06 at the high end. Our $0.08 beat versus our midpoint was driven by exceptionally strong performance in our Climate segment, partially offset by challenged markets in our Industrial segment and about a $0.06 beat from a lower tax rate in the quarter. And as I'll discuss in detail later, we believe we'll maintain a 200 basis point lower average tax rate than our previous guidance of 24% to 25% for 2016.  We also posted strong year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million, up $293 million from the prior year. We're seeing the benefits of our focus on working capital management and our business operating system and our rate -- and with that, we're raising our free cash flow forecast to $1 billion to $1.1 billion, excluding the proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. Let's turn to segment results. The Climate segment continues to exceed expectations, driven largely by outstanding execution in both commercial and residential HVAC with mid-single-digit growth and high single-digit growth, respectively. Margins also showed healthy expansion, driven by strong volume, productivity improvements and material deflation of nonferrous commodities. We also continued to invest in the business in order to derive sustainable growth. The Industrial segment's end markets are more challenged than previously forecast and we experienced negative growth in all the major end markets, except small electric vehicles, which is our Club Car business, and Fluid Management where we continue to see growth. Across Industrial, we continue to take measures to drive productivity, shift our mix further towards more profitable aftermarket services and parts markets and to make prudent cost reductions in the business. We continue to be committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy focused on delivering high returns to shareholders over the long term. Our strong free cash flow generation and cash balances provide us important options as the markets evolve. And lastly, we bumped up at the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.05 and our current adjusted continuing operations earnings per share for 2016 is $4 to $4.10. This update reflects expected continued strong growth in our Climate segment and tailwinds resulting from a lower go-forward structural tax rate of 22% to 23%, partially offset by continued weakness in our Industrial end markets, where we're not seeing the signs of recovery we had originally anticipated in our prior guidance. Now if you'll go to Slide 5. Let's begin discussing additional details regarding the second quarter. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our cost centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a low-growth environment and we delivered against that objective. Enterprise revenues were up 3% organically with Climate up 5% and Industrial down 3%. HVAC revenues grew in each of our Climate businesses, led by commercial and residential HVAC in North America. Thermo King North America and EMEIA truck and trailer revenues continued to be strong in the quarter. Industrial markets declined in the quarter, consistent with the overall market. Club Car performed as expected, with mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. Our adjusted operating margins grew 80 basis points year-over-year with operating leverage exceeding 45%. Our strength in margin expansion was driven through price realization, productivity gains and direct material deflation. We've inserted a margin table on the slide and that'll illustrate some of the items I just talked about. We completed the sale of our remaining interest in Hussmann on April 1, 2016, for a gain of approximately $398 million.  Let's go to Slide 6. Orders for the second quarter of 2016 were up 3% organically. Climate orders were up 6% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits, similar to the first quarter, led by low-teens growth in North America, Applied and unitary, and strong growth of 36% in Latin America, which was against a relatively easy compare in 2015. Asia bookings continue to be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and were down in Q2 overall, while China was up low single digits. We continue to see excellent growth in service, controls and contracting with low-teens growth in the quarter. Residential bookings were up low teens, representing the fourth consecutive quarter of bookings growth above 10%. Organic transport orders were down mid-single digits with order growth in overseas market offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with the expectations we set out earlier in the year, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer in the second half of the year, and this is built into our guidance. Transport orders in Asia were up 23% in the second quarter. Overall, we anticipated some recovery in the Industrial markets as we moved through Q2 and the balance of the year, but we're seeing continued challenges and market declines. Net orders in the Industrial segment were down 5% organically. We saw high single-digit order decline in compression technologies and services. Services continued to be a bright spot and were up high single digit as we continue to focus on the business with higher-margin product streams. We saw low-teens decline in other Industrial products and a high single-digit increase in Club Car. Now if you'll go to Slide 7, please. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, which was up 5% in the second quarter, we saw solid performance in North America and low single-digit growth across Europe, Asia and Latin America. We saw a decline in the Middle East, consistent with the contraction in the number of building projects planned, primarily in Saudi Arabia, and we'd expect this to continue for some time as low oil prices are driving an investment pullback. Our Industrial segment performance in the second quarter, which was down 3% is representative of the ongoing volatility and declining markets that continue across the globe in industrial markets. Our regional industrial markets declined except for Europe and Asia, which were up.  Let's go to Slide 8, please. Climate revenues of $2.9 billion for the quarter were strong, up 5% organically. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, led by 20% growth in North America in contracting and upper single-digit growth in unitary equipment shipments in North America. Europe had equipment growth in the mid-teens and high single-digit growth in services, contracting and parts. The Middle East revenues declined largely due to a share pullback in Saudi Arabia, as I mentioned earlier. Residential revenues were at record levels and up high single digits in the second quarter. Transport organic revenues were up low single digits in the quarter. Truck and trailer organic revenues were up high single digits overall, with improved revenues in North America, Europe and Asia. We also had a high single-digit improvement in aftermarket volumes. Marine container organic revenues declined more than 60% in the second quarter, reflecting a soft first half at various box builders for 2016. We also had lower sales auxiliary power units reflecting the decline in the Class 8 sleeper market. Please go to Slide 9. Our Climate operating margins grew 250 basis points year-over-year. Our strength was broad-based, based on volume, price, direct material deflation and productivity gains, and we continued to invest in the business for sustainable growth. Please go to Slide 10. Second quarter revenues for the Industrial segment were $753 million, down 3% on an organic basis. Compression technologies and services organic revenues were down low single digits versus last year. And industrial products were down mid-teens with growth in Fluid Management and declines in Material Handling equipment and tools. Small electric vehicles, also known as Club Car, organic revenues were up mid-single digits versus prior year from gains and equipment and aftermarket. Regionally, the decline in organic industrial revenues was led by a mid-single-digit decline in the Americas and the Middle East. Asia and Europe were up modestly, partially offsetting the declines.  Please go to Slide 11. Industrial's operating margin of 9.1% was down 250 basis points compared with last year. Lower volumes were the largest driver, partially offset by pricing, material deflation and productivity. Despite the downturn, we continued to invest in the business for the long term. Additionally, capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development were reclassified to the income statement in Q2, which were a drag on margin of approximately $8 million or 1.1 percentage points for the Industrial segment. Excluding this adjustment, Industrial adjusted margins were 10.9% in Q2. Moving forward, we expect Industrial segment performance to trend with the market. We're planning on expanding margins in a down market in the second half of the year through aftermarket growth, productivity gains and cost controls. Please go to Slide 12. Our June year-to-date free cash flow of $348 million was favorable to prior year by $293 million. Strong operating income improvement and improved working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. Because of our strong start to the year, we have raised our free cash flow forecast range to $1 billion to $1.1 billion from our previous range of $950 million to $1 billion. For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 5.6%. We had strong collections in the quarter with our days sales outstanding improving 0.6 days over the prior year and days payable outstanding improving 0.7 days. Inventory is on plan for the quarter, and we're well positioned to serve our customers. Please go to Slide 13. Our cash performance in the second quarter and our expectations for the year enable us to, one, continue to invest in the strategic growth programs that Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovation and differentiated products in such areas as connected buildings, intelligent monitoring and the self-healing systems, just to name a few. Two, we'll also maintain a strong balance sheet with a BBB credit metrics. And three, we'll also maintain -- we'll also retain optionality relative to paying a competitive dividend, acquisitions to build the business and share repurchases.  Please go to Slide 14. As always, our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. North America commercial HVAC and residential HVAC as well as European transport and commercial HVAC markets are generally positive, while global industrial markets are declining. We're forecasting transport markets in North America to be down low single digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed, and we expect the market to be down was slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after single-digit growth in the first half of the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf car markets are slightly down offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. All of our revenue growth forecast are shown on an organic basis. We're forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total; high single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North America business for us; and a flat-to-small decline in transport globally. We expect compression-related products and other industrial equipment to be down high single digits. We expect Club Car to be up low single digits. Please go to Slide 15. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect our organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up 2% to 3% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect Climate revenues to be up 4% to 5% organically. For Industrial, we expect organic revenues to be down 4% to 5%. For operating margins, we're excluding restructuring costs to get to adjusted margins. We expect adjusted operating margins in Climate to be between 14% and 14.5%. We expect adjusted Industrial margins to be between 10% and 11%. And for the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of 11.5% to 12%. Please go to Slide 16. Transitioning to earnings. The reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.47 to $5.57 and the adjusted range is $4 to $4.10 versus our prior guidance range of $3.95 to $4.10. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain. Our full year guidance reflects a tax rate forecast of 22% to 23% and an average diluted share count of approximately 260 -- 261 million shares. The tax rate reflects a 200 basis point improvement versus prior guidance of 24% to 25%. For the third quarter of 2016, revenues are forecasted to be up by approximately 3% organically. We're projecting Climate revenues to grow mid-single digits in Q3 and Industrial to decline low single digits. Adjusted third quarter earnings per share are forecasted to be between $1.25 and $1.30, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.01. For the full year 2016, we also raised our free cash flow expectations and now expect free cash flow to be between $1 billion and $1.1 billion, excluding restructuring charges and proceeds from the sale of Hussmann. And with that, I'm going to turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments. Michael Lamach : Okay. Great. Thank you, Sue, and let's go to Slide 17. So to conclude, we had an excellent quarter grounded in solid execution. I'm proud of the many people within Ingersoll Rand that continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders. I'm pleased with the progress and the momentum and the implementation of our operating system, and the growing depth and bench strength throughout the company that makes the operating systems come to life through continuous improvement. We're building a stronger, more valuable and more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll Rand than ever before. And it's exciting to me and leaders throughout the company to be part of that transformation and to help create a bright future with more individual development possibilities for all our people throughout the world. Results we reported this morning are a direct result of the strategic work, the persistence, the tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we're building. It is a strategic advantage and it's the toughest thing in any business for a competitor to copy. There are a few takeaways I want to point out to you as we head to the back half of the year and into 2017. First, the Industrial businesses are running effectively in a very tough market environment. The management team is aggressively taking and will continue to take the right actions to reduce the overall cost structure of the business. And it's committed to protecting the key product and service investments that will build long-term growth and margin expansion when the markets improve.  Second, the transport market is performing as we expected. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we expect the first half results to be up and the back half of the year would be down. The management team has done an effective job anticipating and seeing around the corners and is proactively taking the actions to ensure strong margin performance continues. Third, commodity deflation has been a tailwind during the first half of the year, and it's going to moderate to neutral in the back half of the year. We have a long track record of managing the price material input equation very effectively and we're going to continue to do so going forward. And finally, let me say, we are proactively reviewing both prior restructuring considerations as well as new actions as our business, markets and even the input variables into our own models continue to evolve. Although we don't have any immediate additional restructuring actions to take or announce today, we won't hesitate to take additional prudent restructuring actions going forward. So with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Before I ask my question, I just wanted to clarify, Sue, did you mention the tax rate 20, 23 is now a structural tax rate going forward? Susan Carter : Yes, it's 22% to 23%, and that's the ongoing rate. Nigel Coe : Okay. Great. That's very clear. Mike, obviously, very strong booking orders -- bookings for the North American commercial HVAC in North America, low teens. You mentioned a 25% number on the last call. I'm not sure we're comparing apples to apples here, but maybe just clarify that 25% as the low teens that you actually booked. And then maybe if you can just dig into the health of the light-commercial versus applied unitary markets? Michael Lamach : Yes, Nigel, thanks for that question. Actually, I would expect 2 quarters of similar growth, 2 quarters of teens versus one 20-plus quarters. So I think that's intact. The pipeline, frankly, has never been healthier than it is right now. And it's healthy through all the institutional large project work. Commercial is maintaining some resiliency that we're seeing here. In unitary, at the light levels, still strong for us. So residential, all the way up through light commercial, still remains very strong for us across the board. Nigel Coe : Okay. Great. So no signs of weakness there. And then just on the Climate margin outlook. You've done 13.8% in the first half of the year. The low end -- or mid- to lower end of your margin guidance for Climate would suggest basically flat margins in the second half of the year, which seems pretty bearish maybe just contextualize why you see an outlook for maybe 14% at the low end? Susan Carter : So Nigel, let me start out and then Mike can add his comments as we go forward. So as I think about Climate in the back half of the year, you're going to have a couple of different dynamics. The first of which, as we talked about, was that direct material was going to moderate in terms of its deflationary environment. So let me talk about that for just a second. What we expect to see in the back half of the year is we expect to see that steel, particularly in the fourth quarter, is going to turn more inflationary than deflationary. So that's part of what's happening with the flatter margins. We're also going to continue to invest in the overall business in the back half of the year. Again, we've got some significant product launches, and we see this as an area that really sets us up for success. So it's really price, a little bit of mix that comes from us lapping the 14 SEER in residential and then investment in the business. Michael Lamach : And Nigel, I'd just say, to me, the biggest number on the page is we're putting 0.5 point -- 50 basis points of margin back into investment. And it's a formula that's worked for us. Sets us up well for 2017. And we like what we're getting out of those investments. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of the Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just on the Industrial margin guide for the second half. So it looks like you're looking at a margin of maybe 11%, 11.5% in the second half. The clean margin was 10.9% in Q2. So I thought maybe there'd be a bit more coming through to support margins from productivity or cost reduction? So I just wondered why maybe there wasn't a bit more urgency around getting the cost out, as it looks as if the sort of margin decline is going to be similar second half as first half? Michael Lamach : Yes, I'm sorry, Julian, starting I would say that again, to me, the most important thing that's happening there is they're really, say, 40% through an investment cycle there that there is just no reason to stop and go on that. And so that continues for the balance of the year for us. And that's something that I think is vitally important. There's a tremendous effort underway at reducing cost in that business. Much of what's not just visible through what you'd say would be qualified restructuring. Much of that is just reduction in place and just other containment actions being taken in the business. So that, really, when I say the business is being run effectively, I have no doubt that all the rocks are being turned over with the exception of protecting this critical investment pool that is important to us going forward. And I use that one example for you because that happened to be the example of the product growth team. It's the one product area that we have launched in that portfolio, and we're getting tremendous results with that. So again, this gives us some confidence that, although it's not a great story for the third and the fourth quarter, we're not running the company for the third and the fourth quarter. We run the company for the long run, and we hope investors see that. And that's part of the reason I think taking good success around the Climate business, keeping utilization up through the combined factory structures that we've got, leveraging the networks of that -- excellence across the compression-related businesses that we have, give us the opportunity to stay the course on these investments, and that's really important. Julian Mitchell : Very clear. And then my follow-up would just be -- you touched on the input cost impact in Q4. I think the last numbers I have on the sort of COGS split are from 2010 or '11, the last time materials were an interesting issue. Is there any update you could give on the breakdown of COGS, in terms of sort of raw materials versus processed materials and components and so forth? Susan Carter : Sure. So if you think about -- and what I'll do is I'll give it to you in terms of dollars. So if you think about direct material spend for the company, Julian, it's about, say, $6 million -- or $6 billion a year in direct material spend. If you then break that down into the commodities that we're talking about, it's roughly about 10% to 12% of that. And as you think about then breaking that down even further, steel is going to be the largest component with copper and aluminum following that. And so the price pressure that we're thinking about in the back half is on steel, because copper and aluminum are pretty much staying the course with what we've seen. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Mike, just thinking kind of bigger picture here, strategically. You guys are actually doing a really solid job, operationally. And I can't help but look at Lennox at 22x earnings, and Atlas Copco at 22x earnings, and just wonder if you're actually reevaluating the portfolio? I know you went through the exercise with Allegion, and the businesses that you retain are air-oriented businesses. But do you have any thought or response to that question or that idea? Michael Lamach : Yes, Jeff. It's a great question, and thanks for the opportunity to step back and look at it. Because I look back over the 7 years that I've been in this role, and I remember when Industrial was the sweetheart of the portfolio, right, from '09 to '11 even through '13. And we're expanding margins so fast that it afforded us the opportunity to do all the great investment we made in the Trane, res and commercial businesses, which is really why you're seeing the numbers that you're seeing today in that business. And so now it's flipped. Remember, that was all happening with no real commercial -- certainly, no institutional support coming from construction markets. And now that's flipped. And it's allowed us the opportunity to keep factories fairly loaded. It's given us the opportunity to keep technical professionals highly engaged in development of product. And all that really just -- it really sets up where at some point when the commercial market in HVAC slows down, when institutional eventually fades, our hope is that we've got a strong, refreshed, energy-efficient, reliable portfolio sitting, particularly, in compression technologies. And we're going to leverage that just like we did from '09 to '11 when it grew 7 full points. We are very leveraged here toward some of those fixed costs. Where we play in the market is in the big machine. It's not the Cameron -- I'm not talking about Cameron, I'm talking about Cameron plus. All the 250- to 400-horse centrifugal air compressors, of which we're the leader now in that area. And we don't really participate much in the vacuum and blower business, which has some growth in it. So we have a product portfolio and a position in the market in these larger machines, that's what's getting hurt right now. And we're not going to throw the baby out with the bathwater here on that, for sure. That's why in addition to I mentioned the product development, but the machining investments I mentioned in the last call and this call, those are going to continue. And we'll put $50 million in the machining in this downturn, so that when we emerge out of this thing, we're going to be more productive. The hope that it's not just 7 points of margin, it's more than 7 points of margins coming back. So Jeff, I think, I really have got my head around the value of what we've created around integrating the portfolio. And over the long run, not really so interested in a flash in the pan around some multiple for short cycle. I'm really interested in building the value of the company over the long run. And again, step back 2009, Jeff, if you invested back in 2009, you're a very happy investor. And I thank you for all the Christmas cards we get to that effect. But it's because we've had the portfolio that we've had. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes, I had a heroic buyback in 2009. Thanks for that perspective. Also then just on the balance sheet, Mike... Michael Lamach : Jeff, just before we do that. Incremental margins every single year have been in the top quartile. Organic growth rates almost every single year have been on the top quartile. We've done that with elements of the portfolio firing and not firing at various points in time. And I just have to believe that there's value in that, and there's industrial logic around what we're doing around the sustainability and energy efficiency fronts of the business. So go ahead. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes, I know, I agree. I mean your performance has been great, and just you're not getting fully paid for it. The balance sheet, what is the plan for the year end? Sue gave us the kind of the generalized color. But with the Hussmann proceeds and the strong cash flow, would you be opportunistically looking to step in share repurchases here? I can't imagine the M&A pipeline is that active but perhaps it is. Susan Carter : So Jeff, let me take a shot at that, and then I'm going to let Mike jump in. But I'm going to kind of use some of the same passion that Mike had in his comments on the multiples and what we've built at Ingersoll Rand. From a perspective of our cash generation and then our ensuing capital allocation, we're really trying to create longer-term shareholder value with the cash that we're generating. And so what we've seen that has been really successful for us is investing in our products and investing in areas like energy efficiency and sustainability. Those are proven for us in terms of building our growth excellence. If we look at Operational Excellence, all of the work that we've done and invested in the company, whether it's in our factories or in our overall processes with the business operating system, all of that has shown to be something that has worked very well for us. So our preference, as we think about capital allocation and your question, is to really invest and grow the company. So to be more specific, then, in terms of what that means, it means I want to continue to invest. It means I want to continue to do all of those things. It means we want to look at the M&A pipeline. But what we have is an opportunity where we can be patient, we can wait for the right opportunity and not just take the cash that we're generating and run out and buy something. So we're really, really thinking about investments. We're thinking about M&A. Dividends are extremely important to us. We understand that. And we're going to continue to have dividends that are in line with our peer payout ratios, and we'll also be opportunistic about share repurchase. I don't want to take that completely off the table. But if I set our preference up, it's going to be to build longer-term value through investments in the business and acquisitions. Michael Lamach : Yes, I agree, Jeff, with Sue's comments completely, obviously. But I would tell you that the competitive dividend's a given, and the fact that we're controlling dilution of the share count is a given. Just we don't want dilute shareholders through that, so that's a given. The optionality beyond that, we want to be really smart allocators of capital. And we want to have our eyes wide open on how we do that. When you get big dislocations in the share price, we want to be opportunistic, and we were in the first quarter between $48 and $51 a share. I mean, clearly, that was a good idea. And we've been opportunistic when we saw value in long-term creation through acquisitions. And so we'll continue to do that. Now all that being said, I think we have less than $1 billion in cash, so that's not a whole lot of cash we are talking about for a company our size to be walking around with. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Welcome Zac. Zac Nagle : Thank you. Joseph Ritchie : So my first question, maybe following up on Jeff's point there on -- maybe just the investment that you're making in Industrial, Mike. I'm just wondering how much of it is playing catch-up versus really investing for future growth? And then, how do you balance that with the idea that we're kind of 7 to 8 years into this economic recovery and could be in this kind of lower growth environment for some time? Michael Lamach : Joe, actually, the efficiencies of the product launch, the 40% of the portfolio I told you about, are in the range of 9% to 13% more efficient than anything out in the marketplace. That's how we're going to market around value, around total cost of ownership. And that's why that business is up in the high-teens and bookings are closer to 30%. We know there's no purpose in us playing catch-up to a \"me too.\" So every single thing we've done has been to leapfrog the efficiencies and reliability of what's out there. And if you just look to the Trane portfolio, you would see that. In every launch we've made, not only is it more efficient than anything in the marketplace but it's using refrigerants that go way past the HFC -- the HFC phase out. So we're not meeting anybody kind of where they are. We are leapfrogging. In this whole strategic analytics piece of our business operating system are really figuring out kind of where to go attack, specifically. And then having those strategic growth programs outlined, with the resources, the talent, the investments outlined, and making sure that no matter what we do, we're committing to that, is why you get 80% plus of the growth happening through the areas we're focusing on. And that doesn't come from me-too catch-up. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That makes sense. How do the investments than maybe -- maybe thinking about it through the lens of Industrial, perhaps you can provide just some color there? Michael Lamach : Well, I'm not -- you're asking [ph] what are the investments are, specifically in the Industrial, Joe? Joseph Ritchie : No -- yes -- no, I guess, just specifically around -- the investments that you're making in Industrial, you had been in like this really just this weaker growth environment, probably expect it to persist for quite some time. I'm just trying to get a sense for whether there's some catch-up to do in the Industrial side? Whether your portfolio is better positioned than your peers? Just any color on the competitive dynamics in the investments that you're making. Michael Lamach : Yes, I mean, the investments we're making are obviously in the areas that we're not leading. So any place we're not leading is a right spot for it. So if we're leading in 250 horse to 400 horse in the world, we'll keep that competitive, and we'll make sure that we're not losing that position. But we're attacking in the other areas that we think are going to grow. That's just sort of the general view. And you can understand why I am not going to be more specific than that, because we'd rather book it and have margin improvement versus just talking about it and really signaling where we're going competitively around this stuff. That's not been our style at all. But I will tell you that it starts with the strategic analytics being right and the investments being very specific. And the product growth teams -- so engineering, operations and product management, agreeing and working toward the 1 or 2 most critically important things to grow share and margin in a very specific product line or service line has been the formula for us that's been successful. We're going to continue to do that. Susan Carter : And so the other thing that I would add, Mike, just as a practical matter, Joe, for what you're talking about is the investments that are ongoing in Industrial are going to be in the same general areas as you would expect. They're going to be in new products. They're going to be in Operational Excellence, so improving our operating results. And they also include some channel investments, particularly in the compression technologies business. So all the areas you might expect. Joseph Ritchie : Got you. That makes sense. And just one real quick one for you, Sue. On just the price cost breakdown this quarter, how much did material deflation versus price contribute? Susan Carter : So it was -- so let me take you back to Q1 where it was about 50-50 price and direct material deflation. In the second quarter, it was a little more direct material deflation, but really kind of a 60-40 kind of look with deflation and price. And we were priced positive in both segments. And so if you remember when we gave guidance and talked about the second quarter, we had originally called that at 110 basis points, and it came in at 120. So again, it performed exactly as we expected it to in the quarter. And I'll repeat the Q1 comment, we didn't have breakage. So it was a good result. Michael Lamach : Yes, Joe, I actually want to take you back to the Industrial question for a second. I just had one more comment here. I made a comment about the strength of the management team, which ultimately I think is what really investors need to believe in and buy. And I look at our Industrial segment management team, and I can tell you that the top 5 to 10 executives running that part of the business co-architected the entire business operating system with me since it began. I couldn't have higher confidence in our ability to win as the markets recover. So I want to make sure that, that point is really clear. It's a very strong management team paying attention to the detail in the business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Winoker : It looks like you're certainly taking profitable share gain on the Climate side, but what's going on in VRF there? And then, on the Industrial side, Atlas Copco Compressor Technique orders were up 1% in the quarter. I know they've got a different mix. I know they've got vacuum and also a slightly smaller North American presence. Maybe is that -- would that explain it all? Or is there something else going on as well that we should be aware of? Michael Lamach : Yes, look, in no particular order, Steve, yes, if you look at Atlas Copco's business, they're going to be strong in oil-free rotary and certainly in a smaller range than our large centrifugal machines. We've got great oil-free product and are growing that business, too. But obviously, that's the bulk of what you see with Atlas Copco's business. Vacuum and blowers, you called out, and that's actually still been a market growing. Yes, when you think about oil-free or vacuum and blowers, you have to think about the industries that they go into. And those industries happen into be growing as well, as opposed to some of the heavier industries that would use some of the larger centrifugal machines for the most part. So we do a very thorough compare with all public information that we can pick up from all of our various competitors, not just a single competitor. Have a good understanding of sort of how that mix looks, and then we are realists about where the opportunity is for us to self-help where we can. Right now the self-help comes into growing the service businesses, and they are doing a great job with that. It also comes in to refreshing and developing the portfolio in sort of a small range -- smaller range machines. And that's where we're going to play, going forward. Steven Winoker : Okay. And on the VRF side? Michael Lamach : VRF, we're -- very well. That's growing faster than the underlying unitary business. We continue to have a very high share. No slow down there from us at all. Steven Winoker : Okay. And then just following up on your earlier question -- or comments around the balance sheet and whatnot. But I guess, Mike, in the past you've talked about there being kind of opportunity for consolidation within the overall HVAC market. Do you still -- how are you thinking about that, given the dynamics of the industry going forward? Do you think there's still room in that? Michael Lamach : I do. I think there are big moves. And I think that -- yes, you look at what we did with acquiring Cameron's compressor business. And we had synergies in the first year of 15%, and we'll drive it higher this year. So look, I think great synergies exist. And I think that these opportunities are happening, but I think they're bigger and more complex deals. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : So I mean, what exactly is going on here in Industrial. I mean this just seems like relative to where you were it was viewed as kind of a high-quality business with pretty solid margins. And it just seems like every single quarter, we're just getting deeper and deeper into a hole here. I guess you mentioned the end markets, I mean how much -- just remind us, including Cameron, how much is oil and gas? And then, how much would be in and around oil and gas? And maybe we're just kind of mislabeling some of the end markets, perhaps? And you guys, like everybody else, do you have more exposure there than we would have thought initially? Michael Lamach : Yes, Steve, I'll save the oil and gas math for somebody at the end here. But if you look at the biggest market we're in on big machines. And I used 250- to 400-horsepowers as being a big machine down 20%. Actually, as you go up between 250 and 400 and past 400, those growth rates start to look like minus 50%, okay, from where they were. These are the most capital-intensive sort of factories we have. And that certainly, when we have those kinds of volume drops, really adversely affects our mix. So you look at volume alone contributing 3 points of negativity on the bridge, you can see what volume does. And as a proof point, again, go back and look at '09 through '11, look what happened when volume came in, after we had been effectively restructuring the footprint there, and that's where that 7 points came from. So we're heavily leveraged toward that any way you slice it, and that's the main reason for it. Now on the oil and gas side? Susan Carter : Yes, so oil and gas is really going to be sort of a low single-digit percentage, Steve. I mean, that's not -- that's part of the issue because you don't have large projects, but it's really the derivative. So all the other projects just aren't happening, and so it sort of gets labeled with oil and gas. And so let me step back and also add to what Mike was talking about. When I started talking about Industrial early in 2016, and I was sort of breaking it down into pieces for you. What I said was that Club Car was about 20% of the business, and it was going to be up sort of low to mid-single digits, that the aftermarket was about 30% of the Industrial segment, and then it was going to be up low single digits. Then I talked about the big machines being down in excess of 20%, and some of the small rotary and small air being up slightly for the year. And then some of the other businesses like the Material Handling business and the tools businesses being down sort of mid-single digits for the year. If I take that and transform that now into what we're seeing in 2016 after 2 quarters : Club Car, the same spot. They're growing in the mid-single-digits range and that's on track. The aftermarket piece of Industrial is continuing to grow. So you've got sort of solid footing with about 50% of the business. However, when you get over into the other side where I talked about -- if I talked about large machines being down 20%, as Mike said, they're now down 50%, so they are down way larger than what we thought. And even some of the smaller equipment is really much more pressured than I thought it was going to be. And instead of being up sort of low single digits, it's going to be down. So you really just have a lot of dynamics that are going on there with the Industrial business. And to bring it back and wrap it around your question about oil and gas and projects, again, it's really the derivative effects for us in most of our industrial businesses where the large projects just aren't happening and the ones that are happening are much more competitive. Michael Lamach : Yes, it's a bit of a Yogi Berra euphemism. But the business will turn when our customers start spending money on these larger plants. And so that needs to happen. C. Stephen Tusa : Yes, I just don't know of anything like in my sector. I mean, I'm not blaming you guys at all. I mean, it is what it is. But just outside of -- if you said, \"Hey, it's down 50%,\" we can look at oil and gas CapEx and that's like, \"Oh, that's obvious.\" I mean, in fact, in the market, right now, everybody is getting credit for a 50% increase in oil and gas-related spending next year in some instances. So I'm just -- I don't know what in the economy, other than oil and gas, is seeing 50% year-on-year declines. Even things like big gas turbines out there, big ticket items are seeing -- are certainly not seeing 50%, maybe 20% declines, not 50% declines. So that's kind of a source of my question, you know what I mean? Michael Lamach : Yes, there's a spot between sort of small plants and energy production that is a large plant. Steel would be a great example of that. Marine, these are heavy industries that use large machines for air, and that's really kind of where we're suffering on that. C. Stephen Tusa : Yes, that makes a ton of sense then. If it's that derivative type of stuff, that makes a ton of sense. One last question, Middle East you said was down. How much was the Middle East down in Commercial HVAC in the quarter? Susan Carter : It was down about 14%. Michael Lamach : Yes. And Steve, I'm going to add one point. Material Handling, if you go back and bridge over a multiyear period, it was 2, 2.5 points of Op margin that went away as that business went down 90% or so for us, okay? So you don't want to look at Industrial and kind of hang it all back on a comparison to Atlas Copco on compressors. You want to make sure you understand there's a couple of points of margin there, about a point in tools. Currency is a hit and then you got the volume impact that we talked about on the bridge. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : I guess I won't belabor the Industrial business. On transportation, could you just talk as to what you saw in the quarter that your view has changed? Because before you were sort of saying how the North American truck cycle was decoupled from the refurb [ph] market? And it seems like you've changed your view? Michael Lamach : Andrew, the subtlety is moving inside that, but the view has always been you're going to see a pullback with American trailer as much as 15% and flat TK. And the mix is changing slightly within that, but it's really what's happening for the full year. Andrew Obin : And can we talk about cadence of transportation weakening into the second half, third quarter versus fourth quarter declining, any preliminary thoughts on 2017? Michael Lamach : Q3 will look weak because the compare was so strong last year that -- it's the highest of high compares for us there and then moderates a little bit in terms of the comparisons for the fourth quarter. But again, you take the first half of the year and balance it out to flat with no change, and marine container being weak, and really all the change coming with North American truck and trailer, and a little bit coming, obviously, from APUs with just Class 8 sleeper production being down. Operator : And as we've reached the time allotted for our call, our final question will come from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : So Mike, just you changed your guidance in Climate from 4% to 6%, to 4% to 5%, but just following up on Andrew's question, is the difference really APUs? Or is it marine? Or is it Middle East? Or is it a combination of the 3? Michael Lamach : Middle East is much weaker than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. And as you could imagine, it's a large HVAC business. And so the drag on the Middle East was fairly material. We're seeing some growth in China. That growth was really around shipping product that was booked, but we really haven't seen the pickup in China per se. If you look at China nonresidential construction, it's still a negative, but for the past 6 or 7 months, it's been trending up. I think it's gone from negative 17% up to negative 2%, but it hasn't crossed over. We really would have thought at this point, we would've seen more pick up. The nice thing in China, buildings are built in about half the speed that we see in other parts of the world, and our cycle times for delivery can be half of what they are in other parts of the world as well. So if we did see a China recovery on the HVAC side, you need to see that, say, within a 6-month period, not a 12-month period. But as you get into July and you're not really seeing the bookings here, it's just a way of really derisking the forecast. And really, that derisking is a theme coming into the industrial portfolio too. At this point, if we haven't seen bookings on large machines or bookings on midsize, even rotary machines at this point in time, the reality is you just call it lower, and it's what we've done. And so we hope we've got to the bottom of this thing. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, that's helpful. And if you look at European transport refrigeration in general and FRIGOBLOCK in particular, it seems like it's hung in there quite well. I'm sure -- have you seen any changes post the Brexit announcement? What's the outlook for that particular business? Michael Lamach : We haven't had a lot of change relative to Brexit. I think like a lot of companies there's a lot of discussion going on, but not a lot of change. And our business really -- U.K. business is not that big in general. It's more the knock-on effect about what might happen in the region with GDP being shaved in general. But the business has continued to develop well. It's holding in there. We don't see things turning there as a result of Brexit or other market factors here, at least over the next couple of quarters. Operator : And that does conclude our Q&A portion of the call. I'd like to turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for any closing remarks. Zac Nagle : I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. We truly appreciate your participation. And I look forward to meeting all of you in the future and reconnecting with many of you that I've worked with before. Thank you very much, and we'll be in touch soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the floor over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. We released earnings this morning. You can find our news release, earnings presentation and our webcast to this event on our website at ingersollrand.com. We are also archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. The participants on this morning's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thanks Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'm going to begin by discussing our strategy and how as a foundation, our business operating system drives top tier financial performance for shareholders. Sue will provide more details about the quarter financials and guidance, then I'll close with a few comments before we answer your questions. As a matter of strategy, more than 90% of our product portfolio directly addresses demands for greater productivity and energy efficiency, with lower greenhouse gas emissions in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. The strength and resiliency of our portfolio comes from our leadership in growing markets that are durable because these markets are central to addressing the global strategic imperative to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to conserve resources. Our business operating system is a systematic way our people work within the company to deliver against our strategy globally. It is a holistic approach that establishes strong baseline execution expectations and builds on those expectations through continuous development of people and improvement of processes and standards. Respecting and engaging our people in the development and maturation of our business operating system makes it sustainable and is a core element of what it takes to win over the long term. Rigorous execution of our business operating system has enabled us to deliver consistent top-tier financial performance across key metrics, including organic growth, incremental margins, EPS growth and cash flow conversion over many years. The third quarter demonstrated our consistent progress against these key metrics. We delivered strong organic growth of 3% across our diversified portfolio. We had record operating margins of 14.1% and drove leverage through the P&L, resulting in adjusted EPS growth of 17%. Year-to-date, free cash flow is more than 100% of adjusted net income, demonstrating our ability to convert earnings into real cash, a fundamental driver of valuation. Record margins in the quarter were primarily driven by continued strength in our Climate business, where adjusted operating margins expanded 90 basis points to 16.7%, with particular strength in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses. We are also pleased to report that our Industrial business turned in a positive direction in quarter 3, moving adjusted operating margins higher by 180 basis points sequentially to 11.6%. Adjusting for the capitalized cost that we discussed last quarter of 1.1 percentage points, the business improved 70 basis points sequentially from 10.9% to 11.6%. The actions we've been taking to improve the business are taking hold, and we believe we saw margins bottom in the second quarter. Improved profitability was driven by Operational Excellence and our continued focus on delivering innovation centered on energy efficiencies, sustainability, system reliability, as well as disruptive, game-changing technological advancements in areas like controls and digital connectivity. In quarter 3, our overall growth was led by our commercial and residential HVAC businesses in North America, where we continue to see strong double-digit growth and market share gains. Our performance in 2016 is a direct result of the continuous long-term investment program, prioritized around a clear set of opportunities and managed from inception to launch by focused and committed product growth teams. And that result is that our product growth team's average to growth rate about 4x higher than our overall average growth rate in quarter 3. Continuously delivering innovation through our product growth teams is one way we produce strong financial results and stay ahead competitively. But the key driver is our commitment to being the leader in energy-efficient and sustainable products. About 10 days ago, the 28th meeting of the parties to the Montreal Protocol was held. At that meeting, about 200 countries agreed to an amendment that phases out hydrofluorocarbons beginning in 2019 and aims for an 80% reduction in their use by 2045. For several years now, we have been planning for the phaseout of hydrofluorocarbons, and over that time, we have been a leader in developing several commercialized next-generation low global warming potential products that meet and exceed the transition requirements to help customers achieve their sustainability goals. Two years ago, we made a public climate commitment to a 50% reduction of refrigerant greenhouse gases in the footprint of our products by 2020 and to transition out of current refrigerants before 2030. We did this to help customers plan from transition period based upon their business needs and system requirements. We are on track to complete; our commitment goals, and to date, have avoided approximately 2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent globally. Another example is our EcoWise product portfolio. Typically, when an ecofriendly refrigerant is used in a system, it reduces efficiency and can sometimes compromise safety. For example, the gas might be flammable or more toxic. With the introduction of our EcoWise product portfolio, we've not only developed a low global warming potential refrigerant product, we've also designed it so the product or system is more energy-efficient. The prime example of this is our new line of centrifugal chillers that have near 0 global warming potential, do not concede safety and deliver 13.5% better efficiency than chillers using hydrofluorocarbons. So now, our customers' not choosing between being green or being efficient. Through EcoWise, they're able to do both. Growth with these products has been excellent. In Europe, for example, the EcoWise portfolio growth has nearly doubled over the last year, and we see a healthy pipeline of high-profile jobs coming in like the Chunnel Tunnel between France and the U.K. After considering -- retrofitted our equipment, our expert technical team worked with Chunnel operators to install units from our EcoWise portfolio this year. With near 0 global warming potential, the units will allow us savings of around 40% of electrical energy use in the Chunnel's cooling system. And to give you some perspective, the energy savings for this project is about as much energy as the island of Aruba generates annually. That's a savings of 53% compared to the customer's former units that we replaced from one of our competitors. Vertical integration is another way that we drive growth and leverage technical know-how across our Climate and Industrial segments. Our vertical integration in compressor technology is one area of real competitive advantage because we engineer and manufacture our screw centrifugal and the majority of our scroll compressors, we own the intellectual property and accelerated our time-to-market with these products. Through our energy efficiency strategy, the next-generation R-Series air compressor that we introduced in quarter 3 incorporates the latest advancements in variable speed drive technology to increase airflow output up to 15%, reduce energy cost up to 35% with an increase in system reliability. Customers are finding the product offering compelling, and we are outpacing the market growth rate as a result. These are just a few examples of how we're making investments in long-term innovation, energy efficiency and productivity to stay ahead of the competition and in front of an increasing regulatory environment. We are also tying in services, controls and wireless to our products so they are leading-edge as technology continues to move quickly. We continue to see double-digit increases in our commercial HVAC controls business and high single-digit growth in services.  In compression technologies, we also realized mid-single-digit growth in our aftermarket business. Our multiyear trend in aftermarket growth is consistent with our strategy to drive service penetration across our segments and create a more resilient portfolio. Turning to cash and capital allocation. Q3 was another quarter of steady and strong cash flow. Year-to-date, free cash flow is nearly $1 billion. Over the past 5 years, our cash flow ROIC has averaged 18% per annum. Our top priority is to increase shareholder returns through high ROIC investments in our business that build a platform for consistent cash generation and investment in growth and innovation. Our long-standing commitment to organic long-term strategic investments is what has enabled us to perform well in both up and down climate or industrial cycles over the years. As an example, in 2016, we've been investing heavily in channel investments that will improve growth by penetrating key markets over the next several years. In addition to fully investing in the business, we spent $250 million in 2016 on share buybacks. We've raised our dividend twice : 10% in February, an  additional 25% in October; and we continue to have an increasing pipeline of interesting M&A opportunities. Our consistency in performance and our result in strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet puts us in an excellent position to maintain significant optionality to move quickly across any or all capital allocation fronts as opportunities arise in this uncertain and often volatile global economy. Before I hand things over to Sue, I want to hit on 3 key areas that we know are important for you to understand based on our conversations with many investors. Turning to Slide 4. I'm pleased with the progress of our Industrial segment in the third quarter, and we believe we remain on track to achieve our guidance for 2016 margins of 10% to 11%. The continuing actions we've taken and are taking to deliver improvement are taking hold. We continue to focus on operational excellence initiatives, restructuring and reducing costs, increased focus on parts and service, and here, we're already seeing growth in the service business, but we believe we can step on the gas even further in this area. Segmentation and focus on growing markets like food and beverage, pharma and electronics, and continuing multiyear product channel initiating investments to achieve strong leverage where the market's recovering. It's important to note, based on the actions we've taken and what we're seeing in the business, that we believe Q2 marked the trough in our operating margins for the business, and we're expecting improved performance going forward in 2017, although the results may not be a straight line up quarter-to-quarter. If you turn to Slide 5, the main takeaway here is that the Thermo King business is resilient. We saw this in the third quarter where revenues were down but margins moved higher. For 2016, we continue to see the business being consistent with the expectations we set out in July. The team deserves a lot of execution credit there for improving margins on declining revenue and for building a more resilient and valuable franchise over time.  Quarter 3 is a great example. The transport business grew margins on a 12% lower revenue base. We do expect about a 20% decline in trailers next year, but we believe we should be able to mitigate some of the downside by growing the business in other regions and in other TK products. Moving to Slide 6. Another topic on the minds of investors is how the Dodge data for nonresidential put in place translates to Ingersoll-Rand. Here, I think it's important to weigh out where our business comes from and what drives the market, but I think the market overestimates our exposure. As the chart shows, the North American commercial HVAC segment is about $4 billion and is split about 50-50 between services and equipment. Of the equipment, about 65% is replacement business, so not new put in place. The result is that our Dodge put in place data just covers about 18% of our business. Additionally, when you drill down further into the 18%, about 50% is commercial and 50% is institutional. Institutional is expected to show good growth in 2016 and even better growth in 2017. Our data set is North American commercial HVAC will be mid-single digits in 2016 and a similar number in 2017. So we continue to see a healthy market going into next year. And with that, I'll turn things over to Sue. Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Let's go to Slide 7. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points for you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we continue to execute the core tenets of our business operating system in Q3, building upon our strong 2016 performance across the 3 pillars of growth, profitability and cash flow. Adjusted earnings per share was up 17% on 3% organic revenue growth. Cash flow was 180% of net income for the quarter. Our performance was highlighted by record results in our North America commercial and residential HVAC businesses where we captured additional market share, while at the same time, expanding margins year-over-year. In our Industrial business, we drove 180 basis points of improved operating margin performance sequentially. We continue to take further actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased our commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service and added cost-reduction activities to improve operating results going forward. The margin improvement was 70 basis points after adjusting Q2 margins for capitalized new product engineering and development cost that we highlighted in last quarter's earnings materials. We believe we are largely maintaining our growing market share across the portfolio despite continued soft industrial end markets. During the quarter, we also extended our strong free cash flow performance by $644 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $992 million, up $527 million from the prior year. Given our long-term expectations for strong earnings and cash conversion, we also increased our dividend by 25% in October to $0.40 per share or $1.60 annualized, making our dividend highly competitive not only in our peer group, but across the broader market. Additionally, we now believe our free cash flow for 2016 will approximate $1.3 billion, up more than $200 million from our previous guidance of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We've also increased our earnings per share guidance for the year given our year-to-date performance and outlook. Our revised guidance of between $4.17 and $4.22 is higher by $0.14 at the midpoint, reflecting the flow-through of our Q3 over-performance versus our Q3 guidance midpoint and an $0.88 to $0.93 fourth quarter. The fourth quarter of $0.90 to $0.91 at the midpoint is consistent with our prior guidance. On the next several slides, I will highlight the key messages for this earnings call. Please go to Slide 8. Our strong enterprise performance on organic growth, earnings per share growth and cash flow conversion was highlighted by our North America HVAC businesses and by sequential operating margin improvement in our Industrial segment versus the prior quarter. Organic revenue was up 3%, as adjusted margins improved 30 basis points year-on-year with 30% operating leverage. Our business operating system again guided us through good execution in our factories and in our call centers. Our focus was on good operating results in a-low-growth environment, and we delivered against that objective. Please go to Slide 9. Organic orders continue to be solid through the third quarter of 2016, led by our Climate business and partially offset by soft Industrial markets. Climate orders were up 4% organically. Organic global commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digit, led by low-teens growth in North America unitary. We also continued to drive excellent growth in service, controls and contracting, with low-teens growth in the quarter. Residential bookings were solid, up mid-single digits. Organic transport orders were down low single-digits, with order growth in Europe and Asia offset by declines in North America trailer and auxiliary power units. Consistent with our guidance, we continue to expect bookings to decline in North America trailer. On balance, the Industrial businesses were flat to down modestly, and we are calling a broad-based recovery in the near term. Please go to Slide 10. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, we saw solid performance in both North America and Latin America and low-single-digit growth in the Middle East. In our Industrial segment, overall performance was essentially flat, with high single digit growth in Europe, Middle East and Africa due to the shipment of large orders in the Middle East, and mid-single digit growth in Asia, offset by declines in North America and Latin America. Please go to Slide 11. Climate performance was strong in the quarter, with organic revenues up 3% and adjusted operating margins up 90 basis points. Commercial HVAC organic revenues were up mid-single digits, highlighted by exceptional growth in North America contracting up 17% and unitary equipment in North America up low-teens. In Europe, business was unusually light, impacted by the slowdown in activity during the summer holiday season, driving mid-single-digit equipment declines. Europe services contracting and parts were flat. Residential continued their outstanding year, with revenues up low-teens. Transport organic revenues were down low-teens in the quarter, driven by weakening North America trailer and soft APU and marine markets. Despite lower revenues, margins expanded 110 basis points with increases in both North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa. This demonstrates the more resilient franchise we discussed. Growth in aftermarket parts and services, trucks and in Europe trailers drove higher margins and helped mitigate the impact of the downturn. Please go to Slide 12. Climate reported operating margins expanded 110 basis points year-over-year. Volume and mix were favorable across commercial and residential HVAC, partially offset by volume in transport. Price and direct material deflation and productivity also contributed to margin improvement. Additionally, we continued to invest in the business to drive innovation and growth. Please go to Slide 13. Third quarter Industrial margins improved 180 basis points from second quarter trough margins on 1% organic revenue growth. Margin improvement was still solid at 70 basis points when accounting for Q2 2016 capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development of $8 million that we discussed last quarter. Excluding those costs, Q2 margin was 10.9%. Industrial end markets remained soft in Q3 and are expected to be soft through 2016. Revenues were up mid-single digits in compressors with growth in aftermarket, oil free and large machines with easier comparisons to the prior year. Other industrial products were down low-teens, with material handling showing the largest decline due to oil and gas exposure. Small electric vehicles were down slightly in the quarter. Please go to Slide 14. Industrial's reported operating margin of 10.9% was down 300 basis points versus prior year. Volume and mix were the largest drivers of this decline. Pricing offset materials, but given the continued low volumes running through our factories, productivity did not offset inflation in the quarter. We continued planned investments in our products and channel and restructuring to improve our cost base. Looking forward, we expect margins to improve in 2017 given ongoing margin improvement actions, although we do expect some variability due to cyclicality. Please go to Slide 15. September year-to-date free cash flow of $992 million was favorable to prior year by $527 million. Strong operating income improvement and working capital performance were the primary drivers of the favorability. For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 4.9%. Our 2016 goal is approximately 4%. Based on strong performance year-to-date and our confidence in future cash conversion, we have raised our 2016 free cash flow forecast to approximately $1.3 billion. This is up more than $200 million from our prior range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. We have a proud history of returning cash to shareholders. Since 2011, our free cash flow as a percentage of net income has averaged 100%. Over that same timeframe, we've returned more than $6.5 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends of $1.5 billion and share buybacks of $5.1 billion. You may have noted that we referenced cash flow ROIC a few times today. Our definition is free cash flow divided by gross fixed assets plus working capital. Our goal is period-over-period improvement in this metric, and we are doing well in 2016 with improved free cash flow and balanced capital expenditures and working capital. Please go to Slide 16. Our strong cash performance in the third quarter and our expectations moving forward enable us to, one, continue to invest in strategic growth programs, as Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovative and differentiated products in areas such as controls for buildings as a resource, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems, just to name a few.  Two, we've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised the dividend over time. Over the past 5 years, we've raised our annual dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate. In October, we announced a dividend increase of 25% to $0.40 per quarter or to $1.60 per share annually. Three, we will continue to purchase sweeping shares sufficient to offset dilution, roughly $250 million per year. Four, we continue to see an increasing number of positive, potential acquisition targets. And five, we strive to maintain a strong balance sheet with BBB metrics to provide optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through capital allocation, as we have consistently done for years. Please go to Slide 17. Our intention is to give you our best view of what we're seeing in our end markets sitting here today and how that translates to our revenue guidance for the remainder of 2016. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. As you can see by the variation of colors and symbols, our end markets are seeing a wide variation in trends. Markets for North America commercial and residential HVAC, as well as European transport and commercial HVAC are generally positive, while global Industrial markets remain soft. We are forecasting global transport markets to be down low single digits. Our forecast for North America trailer volumes has not changed and we expect the market to be down slightly for the year. This implies a decline in the second half after a single digit growth in the first half of the year. Asian HVAC markets are expected to be flat to down, and Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure. Golf car markets are slightly down, offset by increases in the utility vehicle markets. All of our revenue growth forecasts are shown on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid single digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, high single digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially an all North America business for us, and a small decline in transport globally. Please go to Slide 18. Aggregating those market backdrops, we expect organic revenues for the full year 2016 to be up approximately 2% versus 2015, with foreign exchange presenting a headwind of about 1 percentage point. We expect organic revenues to be up approximately 4% for Climate and down 3% for Industrial. Adjusted operating margins, which exclude restructuring costs, are expected to be at the high end of our previous ranges for the enterprise at 12% and for Climate at 14.5%. Adjusted Industrial margins are expected to be at the midpoint of our previous range of 10% to 11%. Please go to Slide 19. Transitioning to earnings, the reported earnings per share range is estimated to be $5.62 to $5.67, and the adjusted range is $4.17 to $4.22, up $0.14 to $0.15. At the midpoint, this represents a 12% increase in earnings per share over 2015. Adjusted numbers exclude restructuring and the Hussmann gain. We have raised our full year guidance for free cash flow more than $200 million to approximately $1.3 billion from $1 billion to $1.1 billion, reflecting continued strong cash flows through 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect Climate revenues to be up 2% to 4% organically, while Industrial revenues are expected to be down 6% to 8%. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share is forecast to be between $0.88 and $0.93, excluding restructuring charges of about $0.02. The midpoint is consistent with or slightly higher than our previous guidance midpoint of $0.90 per share. With that, I will turn it back to Mike for a few closing comments. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Sue. As we conclude, I want to emphasize a few points that I think are important for you to have as takeaways as we head into the final quarter and into 2017. First, we're performing well, with a solid strategy punctuated with excellent execution over time. As a result, we have delivered consistent, reliable top-tier financial performance on organic growth, EPS growth and cash flow over Industrial and Climate cycles. Second, our management team is effective in anticipating and seeing around the corners. Our commercial HVAC business is strong and focused on the right growth areas with equipment, controls and service. We believe we have turned the corner with our Industrial segment and starting to realize margin improvement versus the quarter 2 trough. And our transport refrigeration business is resilient. And our team is capturing margin expansion despite downward sales. Finally, we're building a stronger, more valuable, more sustainable and less cyclical Ingersoll-Rand. The results we reported today are a direct result of the strategic work, persistence and tenacity of the talented people that represent the unique culture we've built. I'm proud of our people who continue to deliver for our customers and our shareholders. Our momentum is strong as we conclude the year and head into 2017.  And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : So obviously, very good execution in a very challenging macro. Any signs of softening as you enter the quarter? And I'm just thinking here about North American commercial, up 9% orders. Obviously, a very good number, but you'd pointed to double digits for this quarter. And so I'm just wondering if there was any tailing off towards the end of the quarter that maybe just caused you to fight, you missed that 10% bogey? Michael Lamach : Well, like 1/10 of 1 point Nigel was the difference. So the good people here would not allow me to round that up, as they should not have allowed me to round that up. So that's the difference. Nigel Coe : Okay. And the kind of the thunder low activity. You mentioned some larger projects in the half. Maybe just give some color on that, Mike. Michael Lamach : Largely institutional, but we're seeing them around the world. There are some large lumpier projects, so it's difficult to always know the exact timing. But the pipeline is pretty strong going into '17. So the backlog '16 ending will be greater than it was. Of course, '15 ending, and then we've got a good pipeline coming into '17. So we feel like the earlier comment about '17 looking a little bit more like '16 was perhaps more institutional tailwind, and if anything, a little lesser commercial headwind, wound that out to a pretty good year. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then a quick follow-up. TK for next year, you talked about North American trailer down 20%. But you think there's offsets. Can you maybe just talk maybe just around where you see the offsets to that? And what do you think is the breakpoint where perhaps there tends to be bigger headwinds for IR. Michael Lamach : Yes, Nigel, actually first, when you think about the TK in and of itself, you've got North America down maybe as much as 20%. You've got APUs down. You've got global marine down. Pretty much everything else is going to go up. That's North American truck, truck and trailer in Europe and Asia, air, aftermarket, bus and rail should all go up. So there's a chance that TK pulls off something close to mitigating that. But when you back away and look across the company, institutional is going to be strong. We think Industrial, margins will recover. So there's a lot of levers to pull inside the company and a lot of confidence in the teams that we've got across company to make it work. We see EPS growth next year, so that's how I would look at it initially. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Stephen Tusa : So just on the fourth quarter. Industrial, I think -- just correct me if I'm wrong -- Industrial profits are going to be essentially flat quarter-to-quarter. I know there's some moving parts around Cameron, and the change for seasonality a bit, it's usually up. Anything to read into there? And then secondly, your free cash flow guidance of $300 million, I believe, for the fourth quarter is down pretty substantially from the third quarter. It's bounced around a bit, but last couple of years, it's been actually definitely stronger than that. So just curious as to those 2 dynamics. Then I have a quick follow-up. Susan Carter : Sure, Steve. Let me start out with the Industrial comment in the fourth quarter. So you're correct that the operating income is about flat. But what you have is a dynamic in the fourth quarter where you really have more of the large compressors. On a year-over-year basis, it's going to be a tough comparison [indiscernible] going to be one of those areas you have tools and Material Handling, which are high-margin businesses that are going to be down on a year-over-year basis. So in essence, you're going to have a volume challenge. You're also going to have some investments there occurring in some of the business. For instance, we're doing some investment in the Club Car business, as well as in new products for the CTS business. So it's really a story about volume and investments, and a little bit less on the Industrial side with commodities, but also some impact there. Stephen Tusa : Okay. Then if I may, free cash flow. Susan Carter : Yes. Free cash flow, that's a great question. So what we've done in 2016 is we've really changed the way that free cash flow has come in. So every quarter, as we've started out in 2016, we've had positive cash flow as opposed to having everything really back-end loaded. So again, I think where we're at, at $992 million at the end of the third quarter is fabulous. We brought it forward, and we brought it forward by paying attention to things like terms on accounts receivable, making sure that accounts receivable is balanced with accounts payable terms across the globe; with working through inventories and making sure inventories were there to serve the customer, but not too much to have additional product on hand. So we've really managed this very, very carefully. And so what you'll see in the fourth quarter is really that instead of doing heroics to end the quarter, we've normalized it, which is really how we want to operate the business and how we want our cash flow to come in. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then Mike, just a quick one, you mentioned EPS growth next year. I think in prior presentations this fall, you talked about top tier EPS growth. I know you had a bit of a low tax rate that helped that growth a little bit this quarter, still top-tier even without that low tax rate. Is there something outside of the fundamentals [indiscernible] the tax rate going back up, or pension, or anything else that kind of will keep you from getting to top-tier? And I guess the fundamentals as they are, with all that in, I mean, are you still talking that way, or is this just, hey, the bogey is really just growing earnings given the headwinds that we have in TK, et cetera. Michael Lamach : Yes. I think, Steve, it's a balanced and diversified portfolio, lots of service. We're investing heavily in the service channel as we've done all year long, and that's paying dividends. So I think that our eyes' wide open on some of the challenges, but not -- and I'm talking about top tier growth from operations. Sue, you might want to comment. Susan Carter : So let me comment on the general business first. So Steve, as we're going through and we're looking at the business, we still see strength in the commercial business for next year. We see strength in the residential business going into next year. We'll see improving margins coming out of the Industrial business. So we're going to get some good play on that. We're going to remain focused in terms of the price cost spread. We know we'll have a few headwinds on the sale side, but we'll still have a bit of deflation that occurs on the basis of copper that we already have locked in and some of the aluminum that we have locked in for 2017. We're also going to hit productivity really, really hard in the business. That's part of our hallmark of our operational excellence. And we're going to offset inflation. We're going to continue to press on corporate. So earnings per share growth next year, I think, is going to come from all of the different parts of the business, as well as tax. Now tax is something that we're really proud of. And we're really proud of because it's -- we started to talk about a low 20s tax rate earlier in the year. We got there faster than we expected. But we got there by really doing what we call operationalizing tax, which is basically we assign tax partners to each of our SBUs. They're working projects within the SBUs to actually work down the effective tax rate, things like trading hubs, things like energy credit, things like really legal entity simplification. So we've really operationalized that. I think it's kind of cutting edge. I still don't think our tax rate is going to go below the low 20s. I think that's where it should be. So yes, we'll get some tailwind out of that going into 2017, because I think the low 20s is where we project the rate. But I think it's operational also and something that I think is really good for Ingersoll-Rand. Stephen Tusa : Right. So low tax rate sustainable, that's kind of the bottom line of that conversation. Tax rate is sustainable. Susan Carter : Yes, that is -- absolutely. The low 20s tax rate is sustainable. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : So I guess, my first question would be on Thermo King. You sized that 25% of the business is North American trailer. I just wondered if you could give any further splits out of that business in revenue terms. And also just focusing on Europe for a second, you sounded confident about Europe next year. A lot of the truck OEMs there have actually been talking about Europe slowing and maybe volumes falling next year on truck. So maybe just give a little bit more detail on your Europe expected for TK. Michael Lamach : Julian, so we'll start with the quarter that we've got in North America. You can add about 20% or so to Europe and the rest of the world in terms of trailer. Truck, a little less than 20%. Aftermarket, a little bit less than 20%. APU and container are high single digits. Bus, air and rail are low double digits. So you've got North America trailer down. We feel pretty good about our plans, pipeline and the other businesses, with the exception of marine container, which we don't think will recover much next year. Julian Mitchell : And then my second question, just around the balance sheet. Your net debt has come down very rapidly. There was no buyback in the last few months. And you talked a little bit about a fairly attractive M&A pipeline. It's been a while since the last couple of deals. So maybe just give us an update on how you're thinking about sort of size of preferred acquisitions and any sort of financial criteria for them. Michael Lamach : Yes. I think one of the things we wanted to highlight for you was that in the last 5 years, and we could go probably a little bit longer than that, but 18% per annum cash flow return on invested capital, we're doing well. So even with the timing on Cameron and that being great, we didn't lose a beat last year, and we're not losing a beat this year in maintaining a strong cash flow ROIC. The kinds of things seem to populate the list for us would be channel investments and product extensions where we're selling products through existing channels that we have today with the sales force that we have today. There's a healthy pipeline of that. It's probably 50-50 if you think across channel versus product. And it's important to be patient there. They would be more accretive if they can be closed. I didn't say share buyback at this level, so the optionality's important to wait it out, make sure that we do the right thing. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Two topics. First one, just back to Industrial, the comment in broad-based recovery, just really want to understand what you mean by that. It would appear you clearly mean controlling what you can control and improving operations internally, but are you also, notwithstanding the pressures you still see in Q4, actually calling a turn in those end markets and see visibility of that happening? Michael Lamach : Jeff, we're seeing flattening really, not improving markets, flattening markets and easier comps coming into '17. But a lot of what we'll do in '17 is improve margins to the op excellence, restructuring cost activity and then very good product launches coming in this quarter, fourth quarter and next year as well. That's really our game plan for Industrial for '17. We're not counting on a broad-based industrial recovery, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : Okay. That's what I thought. And just back to kind of the institutional markets and what you're seeing in the project book. Are those skewed towards new projects? Or is there a lot of retrofit going on in the institutional outlook? And maybe just in general, if you could speak to kind of the retrofit pipeline that you're seeing. Michael Lamach : Yes, it's largely energy efficiency retrofits, replacing old antiquated systems with newer systems, and those projects can get very large. So we'll see it from universities to healthcare to municipalities, big governments, federal installations. This is pretty much the market that we anticipate continuing through '17. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And just actually just one really quick one maybe for Sue. Just pension next year, Sue, any initial thought? Susan Carter : So our pension, I believe, as we look at it at this point, is going to be flat for year over year in terms of pension expense. So I know lots of people are calling headwind on pension because of discount rates falling, and of course, obviously, ours are down 75 basis points from year end also. But I think with the way that we have the portfolio set up, with the asset returns that we've got, my expectation is that we are going to be flat. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So my first question, Sue, going back to your comments earlier on cash flow, good job on the working capital. I'm just curious, as we think through the bridge to 2017, are there any items that reverse in 2017? Or is the right way to think about your free cash flow growth really EBIT growth should equal free cash flow growth in '17? Susan Carter : What we're focused on is really exactly what you said, that the EBIT growth should be the free cash flow growth. And that's exactly what's happening in 2016, is the operating income growth is falling through; our percentage on working capital is remaining through. We're not having to invest heavily in terms of capital, but we're also doing all of the projects and all of the items that our business is bringing forward that makes financial sense. And so if we can keep that rigor going, that is exactly the model we want, which is the EBIT flowing through. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That makes sense. And then Mike, I just wanted to square some comments you made earlier on Thermo King. So with North America trailer down next year and your comments around hoping to offset with other parts of the Thermo King portfolio, can you square that with what your expectation is for op income for Thermo King? Would you expect it to be up next year given that you think there's going to be some natural offsets on the growth side? Michael Lamach : Joe, I'm going to park that down the road here a little bit for us, to be honest. We want to dial in what North American trailer volumes will be. We're going to probably center on a 20% down number and make sure we don't do anything. In the event that it's only down 10% or if it's down 30%, we want to optimize cost structure to match it. So I know that at down 15%, we're working on a plan to be relatively flat. We'll see as we get closer to dial this in, but we need a few more months on this before we can really come back to you on that. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker from Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Sue, just want to clarify the commentary around price cost heading into the fourth quarter. You've been talking about 20 to 30 basis point spread for the second half, so given the 60 basis points this quarter, should we be looking at flat next -- next quarter and then into '17? Susan Carter : Yes. So let's talk about the fourth quarter first. So you're right, if you do the math, and you have an 80 basis point spread for the year, it would get you to flat to maybe 20 basis points spread in the fourth quarter. But what we see happening, and again, the third quarter came out better than we had hoped at 60 basis points, which was really about 50-50 material deflation and the other price. As we start to look at 2017, I think what 2017 does is it reverts to what we've said all along, which is that we would have a 20 to 30 basis points spread between price and cost. And as you start to look at commodities for 2017, so steel has moved around a little bit. We saw an increase earlier in the summer to over $800 a ton. We currently see spot prices back in the $700 range. So we have about a 6-month time lag between when those prices move around and when we see it translated. That means I'm going to see some steel inflation in the fourth quarter, as well as probably the first quarter of 2017. However, I still continue to see tailwinds coming out of copper and aluminum going into 2017, helping us to offset that balance. So we have line of sight to what we think the commodities are going to do, and therefore, we have line of sight what our costs are so that we can price per our operating model with top line margin expansion and get back to the 20 to 30 basis points for the year. Steven Winoker : Okay. And Mike, lean, obviously, has been so important to your story for IR. But I'm just looking at Climate and in Industrial this quarter, excluding volume and mix, you're 20 basis points on productivity versus other inflation for Climate and down 100 for Industrial. What's going on, on a lean path here? Michael Lamach : Yes, well, really, it's the volume running through Industrial so low on the large equipment, which is where the big heavy fixed cost tend to sit. So it's more volume-dependent. If you look at what's actually flowing through, just good productivity on that lower volume. So Steve, the long story short is volume helps productivity. Cost reductions we've taken need volume to apply them, too. And that's -- it needs to happen in the Industrial business. But look, fundamentally, you'll see us turning up the gas again in 2017, and we'll make sure the pipeline -- we try to keep the pipeline 125% of what we think it needs to be. We try to calendarize that by quarter. So what we're doing now, and we do every month, is make sure that we've got that pipeline lined up to be 125% of what we want it to be for our plant, allowing for things to break or timing to be different. Steven Winoker : Okay. Mathematically though, on Page 14 where you show volumes separately in the waterfall chart versus productivity, you're actually saying with this volume effect running through the productivity as well as in the volume part of that chart? Michael Lamach : Yes, absolutely, because we're trying to separate productivity on volume -- from volume at standards. Steven Winoker : Right. Okay. And just sorry, one last thing. The replace that -- you talked about the replacement market being so significant for IR. Are you seeing, as a result of the new investments, breakeven paybacks coming in, shortening for customers that's sort of driving a shortening of the replacement timeframe for specific end markets in any kind of big way? Michael Lamach : Yes. I think the combination of sort of the regulatory effect and the thought of that getting in front of that when customers have the opportunity. Plus from our point of view, there's a passion in the company around energy efficiency and sustainability. I think you hear that every time you talk to us. That combination, I think, is helping our people in the field make the story more compelling. And I do think it's led to why we're seeing share gain globally across the board. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike or Sue, last quarter you gave us a breakdown of what your Industrial business looked like and its major subsegments. You talked about Club Car, aftermarket, large machines, small rotary, small air. You said large machines, I think, were trending down 50% and smaller equipment was down a little. How would you characterize those segments, the subsegments in 3Q? And did you see any improvement in your large factory exposed air business? And do you have any initial thoughts as we head into '17 on those subsegments? Michael Lamach : Yes, you're seeing some of the smaller equipment growing, which is a good sign. You're still seeing really severe tractions in large machines. But we're ready to lap that, I think, next quarter. And so that's why I think it's going to stabilize where it is. And you're seeing still good growth in oil-free machines and contact cool machines that would be supplied into pharma, food and bev, in particular markets, which again, the earlier comments I made were really trying to direct more of that proactive activity into the markets that are actually growing. We don't see a lot of the relief coming in iron steel, air separation, those sorts of markets. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, Mike. That's helpful. And then on Climate, can you just give us a little more color. I mean, you just had a marginal change in your guidance this year, the 4% versus 4% to 5%. When I look at the sort of the pieces, it looks like the only change here is in transport, down low single digits versus flat to down last quarter was your guide. Is that with American trailers? Is it just APUs? Are marines still being weaker than you thought versus something else? Michael Lamach : I'd say it's exactly that, Andy. It's exactly what you just said. It's North America trailer, APU and marine that's being weak. And not really a surprise. We've been thinking about this really all year. We thought it would actually be earlier in the year, it's actually in the back half of the year. But certainly, that's the -- the change, really, as you come through now, the final quarter. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. As you look into '17 though, Marine is very, very low, right? So we really shouldn't have an impact from marine anymore at this point? Michael Lamach : I would hope not. We're trying to look at crop yields and other fundamental factors that determine if you're going to see produce and food and perishables move. So structurally, you're getting to a pretty low level here. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: On the institutional improvement, not only in '16, but you talked about '17, when it first started for you, it seemed like it was mainly in K-12 education. Now it sounds a bit broader than that. Can you talk a little bit more about how that developed and what kind of visibility you have into it? Michael Lamach : Yes, it's the typical way it does evolve. It really is always kind of a K-12 led institutional recovery, and then it moves up through higher ed through healthcare, and eventually, with state city and federal projects. And a lot of that is based on just property value and the ability to tax against those values and have bonds pass local city vote. And so you're into that cycle here now. It's still about 25% below where it was last time on a volume basis. So there's quite a bit of room, I think, in the institutional side to continue to grow. Shannon O'Callaghan: Okay, great. And then Mike, you were talking about some of the M&A in terms of channel investments, product extension, which all sound like good places to go, but they also don't sound very big. The buyback, you talked about over the last bunch of years, was several years ago, can you just maybe update us on your current philosophy around buyback? I mean, given where the stock is traded, obviously, we talked about for a while, but it doesn't seem like there's big M&A in the pipe. So maybe just update us on your philosophy on buyback. Michael Lamach : Yes. Maybe to step back here one step further, I  mean, the first thing we want to do is make sure that we are absolutely investing in the business fully. And I could check the box and say we're absolutely doing that. I can check the box and say we've now put the dividend in a good place relative to the peer group, and we're proud of that. So it really does come down to what do you do with the other pieces of this thing? And if you think about it over the long run, roughly half of the cash, you want to do an acquisition or share buyback. We certainly like to grow the company, but we're not going to do that in the expense of making a poor capital allocation decision. So what you see right now is a large number of channel and potential product extension investments that might fit the portfolio. If we could close, that would be worth the -- the juice is worth the squeeze on those, so that's really why you're seeing us hold back here. Now, with all that being said, we've continued for at least 7 years, I guess now, that I can say -- I've been saying this, always controlling dilution of the share count. So Sue alluded to the fact that it's roughly 2.5 to 4 million shares, and we'll continue to make sure it's part of the program going forward. Susan Carter : And I think what you're seeing, Shannon, just as another point on that, is we're going to be patient with this and with the cash that we have, because we really want to create long-term value. We'd really like to invest in some of these opportunities. And to your point, some of them, in the smaller size with channel investments, but also in new products. And so it doesn't mean that we are going to just make an either/or decision. We're being patient with the cash that's on the balance sheet and we're finding the best opportunities. But we want to let some of those M&A opportunities play for a little bit and see if we can close them because we think that's important, too. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just a couple of questions. First on Industrial margins. Mike, you talked about some of the initiatives there to get margins back up. Obviously, some progress this quarter. But to see the kind of jump back to even '15 levels for March, in 2015 levels, does that require a particular mix to get there beyond just some productivity improvements and running the business more efficiently? Michael Lamach : Well, mix matters, Josh. I mean, definitely, if you look at the high-margin Material Handling and tools businesses, they matter a lot. But if you look at a normal mix that we would've seen sort of pre-downturn, about 70% of the downturn that we've seen has been volume-related. The balance being some currency and then some mix. So fundamentally, we do need volume to return. But that being said, if volume doesn't return next year and we have the same mix of businesses that we have today, we have a healthy expectation to expand margins to 2017 in the Industrial business, based on the actions we can take at these low levels of volumes. And we'll be bold about that, and you'll see us commit to that probably in February. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got you. And then just following up some of your comments on institutional and some of the bigger projects that are in the pipeline. I guess that triggers off a little bit of ore[ph] on performance contracting. So I'm trying to understand maybe some of the mix of orders that are coming in that are more project-related and have some pull-through revenue versus pure equipment-type book -- and I guess it wouldn't be book and ship, but more of your own content-type orders. Can you maybe help dimension some of that out for us? Michael Lamach : Yes, Josh, I don't have an exact split for you, but I'm amazed at the size of the equipment and controls orders that we're getting that are not performance contract phase, like the Chunnel tunnel, and I could name a handful of sort of marquee projects like that. So we're winning a lot of that sort of work, and we're loading up on that work as well. With that being said, performance contracting is an interesting place for us to play, and there is a healthy amount of pull-through that comes both not just in equipment, but in service. Performance contracts always have a healthy service component that comes along with the guarantee. Joshua Pokrzywinski : And when we think about a more institutional mix in \u201817 that would have that type of flavor to it? Michael Lamach : It's going to be large supply and performance contracting. And so it'll be equipment and controls and service with and without an energy guarantee, that's the way to think about that. Operator : And we have time for one more question. Our final question for today comes from the line of Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Robert McCarthy : Obviously, we've covered a lot here, but I guess I'll try on '17 one more time. I mean, Michael, in the context of the last couple of years on the third quarter call, you definitely -- one year, I think you provided a constructive range for EPS growth. And then last year, you just talked about kind of the rhetoric around what you liked in terms of your overall HVAC portfolio. But are -- do you think you have a good line of sight to '17 on a forward basis versus previous periods? In other words, from '14, '15? Or are you -- do you think there's more uncertainty in terms of the outlook this time versus the last couple of years when you're reporting 3Q? Michael Lamach : Robert, I'll tell you, I don't have a public point of view that's prime time at this point. So good try. I appreciate the last question as one more shot at it. But we're putting our plans together now and there's a figurative[indiscernible] process of all companies to put that together. So I don't want to sort of play your hand too soon on that. But we understand what type of quartile it will be. We understand what our goals are, what our operating system is set out to do. And so there's not a lot of acrimony inside the company to understand what good performance looks like. So that's what you'd expect from us next year. And I'll dial that in as we get closer into next year. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Zac Nagle for any closing comments. Zac Nagle : I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As always, we'll be available for questions today and over the next several days. And we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. 2016 was another great year for Ingersoll Rand, a record year, where we hit the mark in all the critical financial metrics. We'll get into some more detail on that in just a minute. I'd like to start this morning by talking about our business strategy and how that has enabled us to deliver another year of top-tier performance in 2016. Then Sue will discuss performance in the fourth quarter, we'll give some color on our 2017 markets and guidance and I'll close with addressing topics we know are on the minds of investors before Sue and I take your questions. As I said, 2016 was a record year for Ingersoll Rand. It follows a multiyear pattern of consistently strong operating and financial performance driven by our strategic framework of sustained growth, operational excellence, excellent cash flow conversion and a commitment to our winning culture. Our strategic objective is to drive profitable growth through leadership positions in growing markets that are durable because they address a global imperative to dramatically reduce energy demand and resource constraints in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. Turning to Slide 4. In 2016, we extended our multiyear record of top-quartile performance on organic revenue growth, incremental margins, earnings growth, free cash flow and total shareholder return. We delivered free cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion and 3% organic revenue growth and operating margin expansion of 60 basis points to 11.6%. Free cash flow was 121% of adjusted net income and more than $5 per outstanding share. Adjusted operating margin leverage was 44%. Adjusted continuing EPS of $4.13 was up 11%, demonstrating the strong leverage of the business. We also retained a strong balance sheet with good optionality, while at the same time, returning a significant cash to shareholders, paying roughly $350 million in dividends and executing $250 million in share buybacks. We continued our long history of raising our corporate dividend. And in 2016, we raised our quarterly dividend by approximately 40%, through 2 increases from $0.29 per share to $0.40 per share. We are now at $1.60 annualized per share. I said throughout 2016 that rigorous execution would serve us well to drive leverage in the P&L and deliver strong cash flow and margin expansion, even in a low growth environment. We followed our business operating system to capture growth, improve cost and drive productivity, all of which translated into 60 basis points of margin expansion. 2016 growth was led by North American Commercial and Residential HVAC. The teams here are doing a phenomenal job of share gain and margin expansion, and we anticipate this momentum to continue into 2017. While North America HVAC led the growth, we made deliberate choices in the selection of growth programs across the whole portfolio, and then we operationally led those programs to product growth teams. We see breakout results with this strategy. The average growth rate for our model product growth teams was more than twice our overall company average growth rate for the year. We also drove significant innovation, launching more than 80 new products and services in 2016, with introductions happening in nearly every business and region. We realized benefits of new product and technology investments as the offerings supported our 2016 growth, share gains and margin expansion. I emphasize this to demonstrate our commitment to organic long-term strategic investment in innovation to remain ahead of our customers' expectations, the competition and the regulatory environment. And heading into 2017, we haven't slowed down with our focus on product growth teams. A couple of weeks ago, we launched our personal transportation vehicle, called Onward, for the consumer market, resulting in a 10% order increase above our initial launch plan. Getting back to 2016, we also continued our multiyear trend of service parts and solutions growth in both segments. HVAC aftermarket outpaced equipment growth annually with high single-digit growth ex foreign exchange. In Compression Technologies, we also realized 3% growth in our aftermarket business. This consistent performance against our strategy to deliver higher service penetration across our segments helps build strong relationships with customers and a more resilient business portfolio. As anticipated, we continue to see more and more growth within our portfolio stemming from smart, wireless and digitally connected solution in 2016 that are more reliable, more cost-effective and energy-efficient. Each one of our business units is executing a digital strategy, and we are a recognized leader in this area. Our Energy Services and Controls business, for example, is actively servicing 6,500 connected buildings, and we are one of the top providers in this space. Anticipated growth rate here is approximately 30% for 2017. The diversity of our business portfolio helps to mitigate cyclicality in our end markets, which has enabled us to sustain strong performance over time. Growth teams dedicated to our lines of business help us create real value using a wide range of technologies and innovation. Our objective is to take advantage of growth where the market is in an upswing and to build on our competitiveness in difficult markets. Moving to Slide 5. The measure of our success is represented by our financial results and total return to our shareholders. Slide 5 demonstrates our consistent performance over time and the metrics that matter to our shareholders, whether it's revenue growth, adjusted EPS growth, cash flow, ROIC or adjusted operating margin improvement. 2016 was another excellent year that extends this track record, a record year and one we're proud of. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Sue to comment on the fourth quarter. Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #6. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, 2016 was a very strong year for Ingersoll Rand and marked another year of continued top-tier performance on free cash flow, organic revenue growth, operating margin improvement and earnings per share growth. While we recognize the fourth quarter contained more one-offs and noise than any of us would have liked and distorted our fourth quarter earnings report, fundamentally, it was still a strong quarter for the company relative to our core businesses. There shouldn't be any significant read-through to our go-forward results. Free cash flow was more than $350 million in the quarter, bringing our 2016 free cash flow to $1.35 billion, which is up 37% versus 2015 or more than 120% of our adjusted net income. From a segment perspective, the combined Climate and Industrial segments adjusted operating income results were solid and a bit better than our expectations for the quarter. Our bookings performance was very strong, with Commercial and Residential HVAC leading the way with both at low-teens growth. Residential revenues increased low-teens. Operating margins also expanded in both businesses. We were pleased with our Industrial business performance, which showed slow but steady adjusted margin improvement after hitting a low in the first quarter. We continue to take additional actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service offerings and took additional cost-reduction activities to improve operating results going forward. EPS in the quarter was negatively impacted by discrete items in G&A, negative other operating income and taxes, as I'll discuss on the next slide. Please go to Slide 7. We've provided a bridge from the fourth quarter guidance range we provided on our Q3 earnings call to our actual Q4 results. As I noted earlier, our segment operating performance was in line with our expectations. Actually, about $0.01 better. We incurred higher-than-expected corporate costs, primarily due to stock-based and other incentive-based compensation given our strong cash flow performance and stock performance in 2016 and from increased information technology infrastructure and security expenditures. These items combined for a negative impact of about $0.04. We expect our corporate G&A expenses to come back down to a more normalized run rate of about $60 million per quarter in 2017. We also incurred higher-than-expected nonoperating cost as a result of foreign exchange losses related to the balance sheet given the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which had a noncash impact of $0.01. Lastly, we had a higher-than-expected mix of earnings from high tax jurisdictions, which impacted us by about $0.03. While this was a significant negative in the fourth quarter, our adjusted tax rate for the year of 21.4% was on the low side of the 21% to 22% range we updated on our second quarter call. I feel good about the effective tax rate, and more importantly, we expect the rate to remain in the 21% to 22% range for 2017 as well. Please go to Slide #8. Top line organic growth of 2% was solid, highlighted by our North America HVAC businesses. Operating margins and adjusted operating income plus depreciation and amortization were both down, primarily driven by Industrial segment margin decline and the higher-than-expected cost we previously discussed. Please go to Slide 9. Organic orders were very strong in the fourth quarter, up 7%, led by our Climate segment and partially offset by modest declines in our Industrial segment. Climate bookings were up in every region and business globally and up 10% overall. Organic Commercial HVAC bookings were up low-teens in equipment, with strong results from both unitary and applied products. We also continue to drive excellent growth in service, controls and contracting with low-teens growth in the quarter. Residential bookings continue to be exceptional, up low-teens. Organic transport orders were up mid-single digits, primarily driven by growth in Europe, partially offset by declines in marine equipment and auxiliary power units. We also had mid-single-digit increase in North America trailer orders in the fourth quarter. On balance, the Industrial businesses bookings were flat to down slightly in the quarter, reflecting some stabilization in end markets. Please go to Slide #10. This slide provides a directional view of our segment revenue performance by region. In our Climate segment, revenue was strong in North America, flat in Asia and down in Europe, Middle East and Africa and Latin America. In our Industrial segment, overall performance was down low single-digits, primarily due to difficult comparisons with 2015 on large air compressor shipments in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa. Revenues improved in Latin America and Asia. Overall, North America revenues were up mid-single digits and international revenues were down mid-single digits, netting a positive 2% organic revenue growth rate for the enterprise. Please go to Slide #11. Q4 operating margin declined 50 basis points, primarily due to headwinds resulting from material inflation in steel and higher corporate cost in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, lower Industrial margins also contributed to the decline. Volume and mix was positive in the quarter. Please go to Slide #12. Overall Climate performance was strong in the quarter, with organic revenues up 4% and adjusted operating margins up 70 basis points to 13.6%. Strong revenue growth in both commercial and residential HVAC was partially offset by Transport revenues, which were down mid-single digits in the quarter, primarily due to weak auxiliary power unit and marine markets, partially offset by growth in aftermarket and in Asia. Climate operating margins expanded 70 basis points year-over-year. Favorable volume, mix and productivity was partially offset by material inflation headwinds and continued investments in the business. Please go to Slide 13. Fourth quarter Industrial margins declined by 220 basis points compared with 2015 while organic revenues declined 3%. Revenues were down mid-single digits in compressors, with growth in aftermarket. Other Industrial products were down by high single-digits, with material handling showing the largest decline, more than 50% owing to its significant oil and gas exposure. Small electric vehicles were up slightly in the quarter from growth in golf. Industrial's operating margin of 10.5% was down 220 basis points versus the prior year but in line or slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Looking forward, we expect margins to improve in 2017, given ongoing margin improvement actions, although we do expect some quarterly variability due to cyclicality. Please go to Slide 14. Excellent full year 2016 free cash flow of $1.3 billion improved 37% versus the prior year and was over 120% of net income. Strong operating income and working capital improvement were the primary drivers of the improvement. For the quarter, working capital as a percentage of revenue was 3.4% versus our 2016 goal of 4% and improved 80 basis points versus 2015. We have a proud history returning cash to shareholders. Since 2011, our free cash flow as a percentage of net income has averaged 100%. Over the same time frame, we've returned more than $6.5 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends of $1.5 billion and share buybacks of $5.1 billion. Please go to Slide 15. Our strong cash performance in 2016 will enable us to, one, invest in our business as our #1 priority. These include investments in innovation and in strategic growth programs, as Mike outlined earlier. In addition to the core strategic investments, we're also investing in long-term growth through innovative and differentiated products in areas such as wireless, controls for building as a resource, intelligent monitoring and self-healing systems, just to name a few. Two, we've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised this dividend over time. Over the past 5 years, we've raised our annual dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate. In 2016, we raised our annualized dividend from $1.16 to $1.60 per share or nearly 40%. Three, we also spent $250 million repurchasing sweeping shares sufficient to offset dilution. Four, additionally, in 2016, we continued to develop and vet a pipeline of potential acquisition targets. And five, lastly, in 2016, we strengthened our balance sheet, which provides stability and optionality as our markets evolve. We also maintain a BBB credit rating, which, at this time, we believe is appropriate for the company. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through a dynamic capital allocation strategy as we have consistently done for years. And with that, I will turn it back to Mike to discuss our market outlook as we begin our guidance conversation. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Sue. And if you move to Slide 17, we'll begin our guidance conversation with some color around our end markets. As always, our intention is to give you our best view as we know it today and how that translates to our revenue outlook for 2017. We've broken it down by major end markets and geographies. We expect North American Commercial HVAC and Residential HVAC to show a continuing growth. In North America, 50% of our commercial business is parts, service and controls, and we are seeing strong demand in all these areas as well as for upgrades and energy retrofits. Residential replacement, which makes up approximately 80% of the total market, closed the year on a strong note, and we expect to see continuing growth next year in both replacement and new construction. Commercial HVAC markets in EMEA and Asia are expected to be flat. We expect Latin America to be up mid- to high-single digit. Transport markets in the Americas will be down from lower volumes for trailers and auxiliary power units, partially offset by trucks. North American trailer volumes are expected to decline by low-teens. Transport Europe is expected to be up based on truck and trailer sales and a bottoming of the marine container market. Asia Pacific was up high-teens last year, and we expect continued growth in 2017 on its smaller base. Global Industrial markets are generally improving, but still remain soft. We believe we are seeing a bottoming trend in our general industrial markets in the U.S. and the Eurozone as PMIs have improved over the last several months. We have also seen some order improvement in our short-cycle Industrial businesses. While this is a positive, the modest rise in Industrial production suggests a gradual recovery, with bumps along the way. Industrial markets in Asia remain under pressure due to excess capacity in many key industries. The large engineered compressor market is expected to show signs of improvement due to stabilizing activity in energy markets and heavy industry. While expecting year-over-year orders to be up, revenue will decline due to depressed 2016 order levels and the average lead time of 12 to 18 months for this type of product. Excluding these longer lead time products, we expect our Industrial segment to be flat to slightly up. Golf and utility vehicle markets are generally flat to slightly up across all regions. Golf is expected to be flat, and we expect to see some growth in our consumer and utility vehicle markets. All of the growth forecasts shown are on an organic basis. We are forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, mid-single-digit growth in residential HVAC, which is essentially North American business for us, and revenues down low single-digits in Transport. We expect Compression Technologies and Industrial products, which includes our power tools, material handling and Fluid Management businesses, to be down low single-digits. And we expect Club Car to be up low single-digits. With that overview as a backdrop, we'll move into 2017 guidance. Before Sue takes you through guidance, I know some of you know that we recently completed in-depth interviews with the investment community to better understand how Ingersoll Rand is perceived and what we might do better to improve in our communications. We just received the results, and we'll be incorporating changes that reflect investor feedback going forward. Thank you to all of you who participated. One of the changes highlighted in the feedback was investor preference for the timing of company guidance. Overwhelmingly, investors said they had a preference for annual guidance with quarterly updates versus quarterly guidance. We have adopted this beginning with the annual guidance for 2017. Annual guidance is also much more aligned with the way in which we make decisions and manage the business internally, with a focus on building a better business over the long term. For those of you who prefer quarterly guidance, we'll get through the transition together and make sure it goes as smoothly as it can. And now I'll turn it over to Sue for specifics on guidance. Susan Carter : Thanks, Mike. Please go to Slide 18. Moving on to our guidance, we expect total organic revenues to be up approximately 3% in 2017. We expect the Climate segment to continue to show good growth of approximately 4% organic. For the Industrial segment, we expect the markets overall to be pretty flat, but for our organic revenues to be down slightly given the high volume of large compressors we shipped out of backlog in 2016, which will make for tougher compares in 2017. The difference between our organic and reported revenue contemplates about 1 percentage point of negative foreign exchange from a strengthening U.S. dollar outlook. For the enterprise, we expect adjusted operating margins of between 12.2% and 12.6%. We expect adjusted operating margins for the Climate segment to be in the range of 14.5% to 15% and in the range of 11% to 12% for the Industrial segment. Please go to Slide 19. We expect continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2017 to be in the range of $4.30 to $4.50, excluding about $0.15 of restructuring. The company also provides the following guidance. Share count is expected to be approximately 262 million shares. Target free cash flow is 100% of net income. The tax rate is expected to be between 21% and 22%. Corporate, general and administrative expenses are expected to be approximately $240 million. And capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million. Please go to Slide 20. Relative to the company's plans for capital allocation, investing in the business is our highest priority, so we continue to make investments in innovation and growth in things like wireless and digital and connected capabilities, productivity, sustainability and in our employees, just to name a few areas. Paying a highly competitive dividend is also a key priority for us. And based on our most recent dividend raise last October to $1.60 per share, we expect to spend approximately $420 million on dividends in 2017. In 2017, we're also targeting spending approximately $1.5 billion between a combination of share buybacks and acquisitions. Maintaining a strong balance sheet also remains a priority and provides us optionality as our markets continue to evolve. Let's go to Slide 21. And now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike to discuss a few of the key topics we know are on the minds of investors as we enter 2017. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Sue. The first topic discussed is our U.S. manufacturing base. I think you're all aware we operate on a region of use philosophy. We localize manufacturing in the supply chain to help us achieve greater speed to market and implement local product preferences. 95% of Ingersoll Rand products sold in the U.S. are manufactured in the U.S. Regarding components, we are likely less exposed as compared to other diversified industrials because of our focus on lean, and in particular, cycle time reduction. We've actually, through the years, been willing to sacrifice some price for faster delivery, meaning the source is coming from within the U.S. I think this issue is a bigger issue for companies that are importing finished goods into the U.S. such as consumer products or electronic companies. We are definitely a net exporter. The second topic is around the U.S. corporate tax rate. As you know, approximately 65% of our revenues are derived from the U.S. And therefore, we pay a significant amount of U.S. corporate taxes. If there is a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate, we would expect to benefit from it. Turning to Slide 22. I know we'll receive questions on the status of Industrial. Fourth quarter was above the guidance we gave in revenue and operating margin. We saw growth in several vertical markets, including food, pharma and tech as well as with our compressor aftermarket business, which was up 3%, as I mentioned earlier. However, we continue to see soft markets in large compressors and in the energy markets. We have seen some bottoming with order for our shorter-cycle businesses such as Power Tools and Fluid Management, both up in the fourth quarter. As I indicated earlier, we expect the industrial markets to stabilize in 2017, although we cannot declare a definitive turning point. Excluding large compressors, we expect Industrial to be flat to slightly up, and we do expect to realize margin expansion through our operational excellence initiatives, new product launches, restructuring actions and ongoing cost reductions. Covering our transport business, you'll recall last year, we had a better-than-anticipated first half, a decline in activity in the second half, as we expected. For 2017 overall, we expect Thermo King revenues to be down low single-digits year-over-year. The North American trailer industry is expected to be down low teens year-over-year. We're also expecting a continuation for a relatively soft market for auxiliary power units and marine containers. Those declines will be partially offset by gains in Europe, Asia and aftermarket revenues. Through restructuring and efficiency, we would expect only a minor erosion of record 2016 operating margins. Moving to Slide 23, I'll touch on currency as a headwind for us in 2017. About 35% or $4.8 billion of our revenues are outside of the U.S. Our 2017 forecast has built in the continuing strength of the U.S. dollar, which will impact us most notably in the euro and Asian currencies. Overall, we expect a 1% drag on our revenues from currency translation, which will have about $0.10 negative impact on our EPS. And finally, we know material inflation is top-of-mind. We have 10 basis points positive price, covering material inflation in our guidance. And of course, we're working to increase that even further. We've been through various cycles and have a strong history of capturing price to material inflation. This long track record of managing price demonstrates to shareholders the discipline that exists with our people, systems and processes. So in closing, on Slide 24, we built a stronger, more valuable and less cyclical Ingersoll Rand. I'm proud of our employees who delivered a record 2016 performance, and that make us a more sustainable company in every way. I am confident in our management team to execute our 2017 plan. We will maximize growth and focus on productivity and cost where markets are not accelerating. Our Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses are strong and focused on growth areas with equipment, controls and service. Our Transport Refrigeration business is diverse and agile and will execute their strategy as they typically do. Our Industrial businesses are focused on margin expansion as markets stabilize. As a result, I'm confident we'll continue to deliver top-tier financial performance. And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from UBS. Shannon O'Callaghan: Mike or maybe Sue, on the free cash flow, just remind us why it was so particularly strong in '16. I mean, the working capital performance was great. It looks like CapEx was a little bit lower; you're bringing that up. Just maybe refresh us on the dynamics of why you see that still being strong in '17 but not quite the version of '16. Susan Carter : Shannon, that one's a -- that's a great question for us. Free cash flow was really strong in 2016 because we really focused on all of the basic fundamentals. What we wanted was we wanted our operating income to flow through to cash flow, so we were very focused on making sure that on the accounts receivable side that our terms for our customers were balanced with our terms for our suppliers. We went after disputes. We went and talked to our customers that had past dues. We worked with the supply base on accounts payable terms. And we also did a lot of work on our inventory processes as part of the business operating system. So we really, really focused on getting the operating income to drop through, getting the working capital to a level that was not only good but also sustainable. And then our spending on other items, we didn't limit anything on CapEx, to your point. We didn't do anything like that. We ask for good investments as a part of the business. So we actually used free cash flow in a very good way in 2016, and we had a very good result. And I think another point to give you on not only was free cash flow excellent based on the performance of each of our businesses and the core group folks, but it was also pretty evenly measured throughout 2016 as opposed to being a very lumpy free cash flow. So I think everything came together for that in 2016. Michael Lamach : Sue won't say this, but I'll say it. She did a great job and her team training the organization of something we had fun with, called \"in the know on cash flow.\" We had everybody in the organization go through that with the purpose to explain that everybody in the company has got something to do with cash flow. And people got excited about its story. It's really kind of pushing through. And I think that level of engagement is a factor. Somewhere in there, it made a big difference around people really exceeding this. Shannon O'Callaghan: And then, Mike, maybe on the strength on those Climate bookings. I mean, up 10% organic. It looks like you're gaining share and you kind of made a lot of new product investments. When you look across either the product type of applied unitary or the regions, any particular area that you feel you're particularly well positioned in terms of share gain? Michael Lamach : Shannon, we just -- it was amazing in that it was across the globe and it was across unitary flag controls and service. So I mean, it was just across the board. We didn't have a single pocket of weakness really anywhere in the world, which is reassuring to us, and that's a broad-based approach. And that, I think, gave us confidence around the guide we gave for the year around pretty good growth continuing into 2017. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Great teaser, by the way. I appreciate all the extra color in the slides. So I just wanted to come back to Shannon's question on the outgrowth. It does feel like you gained share pretty much across the board. So a question that comes up a lot is, how sustainable is that dynamic? And maybe if you just touch on what do you think is driving that outgrowth in -- particularly within commercial HVAC? And then equally, it does feel like you're lagging your big competitor in compression. Maybe just touch on that as well, Mike. Michael Lamach : Yes. First, I would say, Nigel, that you have to go back and realize that it's been investments sustained over time and product launches have been occurring at a high rate for some time. I think we've got the best channel in the world in terms of the people out there that are systems experts capable of bringing those stuff to the market. And we got the largest, that we know of, field service force in the world around HVAC systems, over 4,500 people out delivering that are employees of the company. And you combine them all together with investments in digital. And I feel like it's been not a flash in the pan around something happening in the fourth quarter. It's been good for a long time. And it's up to us to continue to innovate and to continue invest in the channel. Half the investments or more than we're making in 2017, again, go back into the channel itself, not just into product. We look at Compression Technologies, similar investments happening there, we're seeing good growth on the service side. You had asked reference to CAPCO, you have to look at CAPCO, and there's a 5-point swing just in currency. CAPCO would have shown a 3-point gain, we show a 2-point headwind in currency, 5-point net. We back out, look at the organic growth, I think they were minus 5, we were minus 4. There's other subtleties in the business, but look, we're all, I think in the compressor business, looking forward to brighter days. I don't think there's a read-through when you do the side-by-side math between CAPCO and us around the difference in performance. Nigel Coe : Okay, that was really helpful. And then on the capital allocation, the $1.5 billion of the targets, what does that mean? Does that mean that there's ambition to deploy that amount but not -- but if there's no opportunities, you won't? And how do you think about that toggle between M&A and share buybacks? And this time next year, if you haven't deployed that capital, why would that be? Michael Lamach : Yes, I think you had it right in your note this morning, Nigel. $1.5 billion is what we're saying we're targeting to deploy in 2017. And $250 million of that, we've already said, look, that's going to control any kind of dilution in share count. It leaves $1.25 billion left, and we're going to be really smart about how to deploy that. So very patient, very selective around the M&A front. And we're going to be patient around share repurchase. But between the 2, we expect to deploy $1.25 billion, and we're just going to update you as we go through the year. It's difficult to forecast that on an EPS basis because certainly, on share count, it matters when and where you buy shares during the year through average back in. And M&A, clearly, on a GAAP basis, EPS accretion is difficult to see in a partial year, maybe even within the first full year. So it's difficult to forecast that. It's dependent on the actual target. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Just a follow-up to Shannon's question on free cash flow. I mean, you talked about how you kind of focused this year on all these moving parts. I guess, is '17 -- was there some pull forward into '16? '17 is down. I wouldn't have expected to be down that much. You talked about the conversion rate as being sustainable, and obviously, above 100% is good, but just down year-over-year by the magnitude. Just curious if there was anything unusual about that '16 performance. Susan Carter : No. There was really nothing that was unusual about the 2016 performance, Steve. What I did is I look at 2017, as I did a couple of things. One, on working capital, I was really allowing working capital to go back up to around the 4% level, and I'll tell you why. As our markets are a little bit lumpy, choppy, some of them recovering, I want to make sure that our businesses have the option to have inventory on hand so that not only can we meet customer requirements, but that we can meet on-time delivery requirements. So I'm giving us room for a little more working capital. And really, I'm primarily talking about inventory in terms of 2017. The other part of that is our capital expenditures are actually going up a bit year-over-year. I gave you a guide of $250 million. And really, the majority of the increase in the CapEx year-over-year is really in our factories, in productivity producing projects and things like, primarily, precision machining in the factory. So I gave a little room for all of that, and that really takes it down to the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion level. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay, that makes some sense. And the restructuring you guys are doing, it's a bit of a step-up. Just curious as to why you're stepping that up now given the strong kind of volume picture on orders? Where specifically is that going? Michael Lamach : Steve, so fundamentally on that, we're really going to discuss sort of where that's going as we deploy it because we want to make sure that we're in front of that internally versus speaking to it externally. But in a lot of the cases where we've been sort of on the fence with doing some things, we found opportunities within those business cases. Examples might be where real estate values would have changed in the underlying idea, and so there might be an opportunity to consolidate a footprint that we didn't have in the past. So there's a fair bit of that going on as well. So we've got sort of ideas around that $50 million, and we're going to update you as we go, but it's a good placeholder for now. And so [indiscernible] C. Stephen Tusa : And then the payback on that? Michael Lamach : Yes. So -- yes, well on the $50 million, we'll probably see $10 million in '17. Then we'll go to something more full run rate, probably $20 million in '18 on that $50 million. C. Stephen Tusa : Great. And then one last question, just on the first quarter, maybe my clients are going to hate me because they don't want guidance anymore, but I think it's good to at least have a nice frame work out there. Normal seasonality at least that we calculated, it gets me in the kind of the low- to mid- 50s from an EPS perspective. Is that too far off? Michael Lamach : From a seasonality perspective, Steve, we went back over 5 years, and we're pretty much now, I think, dialing in. So first quarter usually is kind of 10% to 12% of EPS for the year. And then we're kind of a front half, back half 45%, 55% sort of company. You shouldn't get too far off with that sort of math going. Steve, before you cut off too, I want to thank you for spending as much time as you did at the ASHRAE show with our team. They really appreciated you stopping and spending time with them. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie, Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : First, so I guess my first question is that maybe just touch a little bit on price cost. Clearly, a little bit of a headwind in 4Q. And talk a little bit about what kind of pricing you think you can get through across your portfolio in 2017. And to the extent that you can talk about cadence, that would be helpful as well. Susan Carter : Sure, Joe. Let me start out and give you some basic parameters around this. So we knew going into Q4 that we were going to be in an inflationary environment for steel. Pricing did not offset the inflation in the fourth quarter, so we were down 40 basis points, as you saw on the slides and heard from our commentary. As we look at 2017, we've got that currently pegged at price over material inflation at about 10 basis points, really working towards trying to get back to our norm of 20 to 30 basis points. But let me talk a little bit about what's happening in 2017. So if you think about what drives the material inflation, it's really all around steel. The nonferrous, so the copper and the aluminum, first of all, we're locked about 68% on copper going into 2017, but those should be relatively flat, so neither inflationary or deflationary as we see it right now. Steel has 2 components to it, one of which is just the raw commodity that's there. And then an even bigger part of that is actually the Tier 2 materials that contain steel that become inflationary. And one of the questions that I ask our group and wanted to pass on as we think about that is my question was, can we just really negotiate with the supply base? And part of this is really on how we've done contracts and written in escalation clauses. So long story short, steel and components that contain steel are going to be inflationary in 2017. And like I say, we'll continue to work price as we go throughout the organization. Now when you think about pricing, you think about different areas. We've been successful at getting price in both of our segments in 2016, and I think we'll get price in both segments in 2017. Asia is going to be tough. That one's an interesting market. Some of the others, again, price is not for us just a catalog and a price on a particular item. We're baking price into every engineered order type of project as we go along. So again, pricing is going to be a work in progress. I think there is going to be a little pressure on that as we go into 2017, but inflation comes from steel. Michael Lamach : Joe, recognizing you've been with us now a couple of years, but if you go back all the way to 2010, I know personally, even late 2009, we put in place and have been adapting and training to all the methods and tools for pricing and systems around the company. So there is a lot of rigor in the operating system around that, a lot of reporting and remediation around that, mitigation around that. So on a topic like this, you'd have to go back to a 7-year record of every year, being able to deliver on that. I don't suggest that it's going to change in 2017. So it's a little bit here on the benefit of the doubt associated with the tools and the methods of training that we've done over the years. Joseph Ritchie : That's helpful, both of you guys. I guess, maybe my one follow-up, maybe just switching gears to like Thermo for a second. Orders turned positive this quarter. I know that you're calling for North America truck trailer to be down low-teens in 2017. Your largest competitor, who we just saw at the same conference, I think, is forecasting down mid-single-digits. Is there any reason why there'd be either a lag or a change in the trajectory that either of you see for 2017? Michael Lamach : Well, two factors that always play here. One is around which side of customers are buying and which are not. And you'll see anomalies quarter to quarter about kind of who came to the table. So in the fourth quarter, certainly our customers came to the table and placed orders, which is great. The second, really, piece of this thing is that it's awfully early to call. ACT is saying 43,000 units. We've got about 40,000. If you want to write back to ACT, now you're sort of in that range that our competitor would have outlined for you. We tend to think historically, with the exception of last year, that they kind of met in the middle somewhere. So we're a little bit more conservative around the 40,000-unit ACT number versus 43,000. That's probably explaining the difference now we're seeing in the market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question about the fourth quarter reinvestment on security and IT. A, could you just talk a little bit more about it? And second, I'm just really curious, what was the timing of the decision to make this reinvestment? And what I am trying to understand, we're starting to get a sense that companies are getting more comfortable with growth and actually, for the first time in several years, are choosing to put money into their businesses again. And I was just trying to understand if that's what's happening at Ingersoll Rand or if there was something else? Michael Lamach : Yes. One of the things, Andrew, when it comes to infrastructure and cybersecurity, which are often related, I think once you have the idea that you need to do something or want to do something, I think that common thinking would be that sooner is typically better than later, if you think that you've got something you want to plug. That's generally sort of the thought process, the management decision to do that. It's also why, frankly, you should always understand we're trying to do the right things for the long run, not for the quarter. So that in and of itself may not have been the difference. I mean, it was more the other discrete items that are difficult, if not impossible, to forecast, stock-based comp, incentive comp, certainly get that packed by legal entity as opposed to tax by geography or business unit is more nuanced. But that's one where, generally speaking, if you need to spend it, sooner is typically better than later, and that's been our approach. Susan Carter : And I would just add just a little bit to that, Andrew, in terms of, if you look at the full year of 2016, we started out the year and we obviously talked pretty regularly to all of the teams around the company. And we really said, don't let our cost get out ahead of what the revenue profile is. So if you looked at corporate cost for really the first 3 quarters of 2016, you would see that our run rate was actually under what would be typical for a $240 million year. That doesn't mean that because you're under, you should go out and do some things. But it also adds to part of the thinking when you get to an area where you have some items that you need to spend money on, you just -- you go forward and say, for the year, our cost, whether it's in IT, whether it's in legal, HR, finance, whatever part of our functional spending are actually flat from 2015 to 2016 and actually will be flat into 2017. So there's also a little bit of a timing element that is a part of that, too. It doesn't explain the difference in the guidance, but I also wanted to give you some context of what we were thinking as we went into the fourth quarter. Michael Lamach : And just to be clear, and what Sue said, so '15, '16, '17, the core functional costs have been absolutely flat, which has been our objective, what we're driving to. All the swing you see are in things like stock-based comp, pensions, adjustments that are really happening sort of around those core functional costs. Andrew Obin : Got you. The other thing, you made a specific commentary about seasonality on Industrial in 2017, and you did call it out. And so what's different versus history on this quarterly variability in the Industrial business? Michael Lamach : Andrew, the only comparison I think we made was comparing Q4 '16 to Q4 '15 because Q4 '15 had that mammoth load of Cameron shipments, which drove the difficult comp for quarter 4. Not a lot of seasonality in Industrial beyond that, that we would call out, with the exception that, for some reason, with large compressors, the kind that are put into gas and energy applications, have tended to been more fourth quarter loaded. But I'm not sure that that's an actual seasonal phenomenon as opposed to sort of when we're booking and shipping orders. Andrew Obin : So just to correct, I guess I misunderstood. So there is nothing different about Industrial seasonality in 2017? Susan Carter : No, Andrew. I think the comment that we were actually making in, perhaps we didn't make it as well, is we thought was that what we didn't want anyone to do was to take and draw a straight line on margin improvement each and every quarter in the Industrial business. We were saying that it could be a little bit lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and would follow its typical pattern. So we just didn't want anybody to get concerned if there was some variation there. So it was a pretty simple comment that might have been confusing. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the residential bookings at up low-teens, maybe some color regarding the product, the mix, where this year preferences look to be in 2017 and was there any prebuy involved. Michael Lamach : No prebuy involved, but I think you know that the res product is fundamentally 100% new over the past 3 years. We've got just a few little things we're tweaking. And we found that as the mixes move, the 14 SEER and above, this is playing really well in our dealer base. So I think this is just -- going back to the commercial discussion, it's been long-term investment and getting the product portfolio right long-term investment and repositioning our dealer base to be able to sell low, medium and high price point product, penetration into the residential construction market, penetration into the owner-occupied but nonresident market, which is another market that we've had some good success with. So I guess, good hard product development, channel development and sticking to a strategy here over the long run. Susan Carter : And I think, Deane, from -- you asked a question on SEER. So as we went through 2016, the 14 -- the 13 and 14 SEER kind of combined for roughly about 50% of our revenues. And then the 15 SEER and greater was a smaller percent. So really, really, what you saw was the 13 SEER going to the 14 SEER product and the 15 SEER and above sort of stayed the same. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just as a follow-up, there was an interesting development recently with your primary competitor in golf carts investing in Arctic Cat. So does that change your thinking in any way of how you want to be positioned? You did mention the new product launch of Onward. I went online just now and took a look at it. Those look pretty cool brands for a golf cart, but looks like it's an organic focus for you all with Club Car. But maybe some comments there. Michael Lamach : Yes, looks better with the lift kit, too, Deane. So look at that picture, that's what you need is big wheels and a lift kit. That's what I'm going to get. Anyway, yes, no, we're -- it's an organic focus because we think the brand's got legs. We think that we've always focused on consumer -- on golf and utility. And it's a real concerted effort to penetrate the consumer low-speed vehicle market and personal vehicle market. Not -- this is golf and car communities, small vehicle communities. This is hospitality and recreation venues. This isn't 65 miles an hour running through rough country. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Unknown Analyst : This is Seth Girsky [ph] on for Andy. Last quarter you talked about expecting Asia HVAC market to be flat to down in 2017. And 3Q bookings were flat. But bookings in Asia HVAC were high teens this quarter. So can you talk about what your expectations are for Asia HVAC in 2017? Michael Lamach : Well, it was a really great fourth quarter. I think that you're going to see sort of a more moderate view toward Asia, kind of mid-single digit in Asia for the full year. So it just happened to be the opportunity to book a tremendous amount of orders, with the small group of customers that are buying large, and it's going to be lumpy. But I still think it's kind of a -- it's going to be a cycle, and you're going to see sort of mid-single digit at the end of day. Unknown Analyst : Got it. That makes sense. And then on -- in the Industrial segment, Material Handling seems to still be under pressure. But can you talk about your visibility to a bottoming in the Material Handling market as oil prices continue to recover? Michael Lamach : Yes, it has to do with really the count of offshore rigs increasing. That's probably the biggest determinant. Land rigs have an effect, but the content that we provide in a land rig versus an offshore rig are going to be dramatically different. So I'm pleased to see really utilization of offshore rigs. You're not going to see a full recovery in that business. Incredible margins, fantastic business. That's why it hurts when it's actually down. You really have a dramatic effect on the margins for the segment. Frankly, it's about 1 point in the fourth quarter. So small business, big impact. We love it when it's up; it hurts when it's down. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Bernstein. Steven Winoker : Mike, I'm over at ASHRAE right now, and one of the things that strikes me is no matter -- most people I talk to, they're seeing growth in VRF in North America on the order of 15% to 20%, depending on how you count it. I know you've talked in the past about maybe I think it's 25% of the market volume going to your channels. But one thing that's been apparent is a lot of that is non-Trane product really. And the actual Trane or wheat content sounds pretty low. So what -- I've seen other folks successfully transition to their own content or their joint venture content that they own part of, et cetera. Are you -- what's your plan and strategy here? It's one of the only places you don't have -- don't really own it and not vertically integrated and seems like a big opportunity. Michael Lamach : Yes, Steve, look. One of the things here is we have a very definitive plan of what we're doing. I'm not going to disclose it here for strategic reasons to do that, but I'll tell you that it's a source of investment in Q4. It's a large business in Asia, and it's growing. And we make and codevelop our own product there with partners. Here, our growth rates are higher than the rates you're reporting. So we're seeing higher growth rates in our unitary business and higher growth rates than what you're seeing. Our focus really is on the VRF business, not on the mini-split business. We think that's where the value is. That's where controls matter. That's where hybrid systems come into play. It's where our channel works and where service is a possibility. So again, our focus is on VRF. You've seen Trane-branded product there in the U.S. Mini-splits, we're a bit more agnostic that we serve the market. We're not as caught up in whether that says Trane or Trane of somebody else or somebody else going through our market. Steven Winoker : Okay, that's helpful. And also on -- back to the cash flow discussion for 2017. So at the midpoint, it looks like that 100% conversion, Sue, you talked about 4% working capital target. But Mike, I think it's a decade now almost that we've been talking about lean conversion and much, much better inventory and other management. So maybe a little flavor here, and why couldn't you keep it at a lower inventory level to still meet channel demand? Or is it just a shift in work in inventory from raws and working process to finished goods? What's going on there? Michael Lamach : Yes. I think that whether it's 3.6 or 4 and whether inventory turns are 6.8 or 6.9 really isn't what we're trying to do. We're trying to do is get 100% on-time customer shipment at cycle times that competitors can't deal with and pick up all the discretionary business that's out there to get. And we want a balance between the two. As long as we're growing margins and growing share, we feel like it's a good formula. So the place to put the gas down isn't on creating a problem where you're inadvertently creating a situation where you're not competing in the area that you want to compete. So Steve, you know this as well as anybody that really that cycle time conversion and that compression and cycle time is worth something, not just in working capital but on growth and operating margins. And so that's always been our focus. And so whether it's 3 6 or 4, it's not as important to us. It's -- we know it's already, if not the best, it's certainly top quartile working capital, top quartile inventory turns. And our return on invested capital last year was almost 24% as a company. Cash flow return on invested capital was 24%. I mean, so let's grow the company, and let's grow margins. Steven Winoker : Yes. No, that's great. I just wanted to make sure that you've had tremendous traction in this area. I just want to see that the pedal is still pushed down, that's all. Michael Lamach : It'll never let up. I promise you. As long as I'm breathing, it will never let up. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for any closing comments. Zac Nagle : I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call, and thank you for your interest in Ingersoll Rand.

Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. 2017 is on track with a strong first quarter. Our results marked another quarter of proven top-tier financial and operational performance and are indicative of successful execution of our strategy powered by our business operating system. Our principal approach and the values inherent in our culture have created a unique and lasting commitment to continuous improvement and focus on our customers. That focus and winning culture translates into the sustainable business results we expect for 2017 and I thank our people around the world for their dedication.  While still early in the year, our first quarter performance gives us confidence in raising the low end of our earnings per share guidance range by $0.05 from $4.30 to $4.50 to $4.35 to $4.50. Our free cash flow guidance continues to be 100% of net income or approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion for fiscal 2017.  And as we indicated in our fourth quarter call, in January of this year, we'll be sharing more color on our strategy and longer-term targets out to the year 2020 at our upcoming Investor and Analyst Day in Davidson, North Carolina on May 10. I know many of you will join us at the event or via the webcast, and we look forward to doing a deeper dive on our business at that time.  I'll start this morning with discussing our business strategy and how that enables us to deliver top-tier performance for our shareholders, our customers and employees over the long-term. I'll also give some color on our outlook for our key markets in 2017, which is largely unchanged from the comments we provided in our Q4 2016 earnings call, so we'll discuss our first quarter performance in more detail and address some topics we know are in the minds of investors before we take your questions. Our strong first quarter performance underscores that our strategy continues to deliver results. We continue to deliver profitable growth through leadership positions in growing markets that are durable because they address a global imperative to dramatically reduce energy demand and resource constraints in buildings, industrial processes and transportation. Sustainability is central to our strategy and we think of that as a lens on the business to identify opportunities, to help our customers manage their sustainability impact.  Our strategic focus served us well in the first quarter. We followed our business operating system to capture growth, improve costs and drive productivity to deliver adjusted continuing EPS of $0.57 and 4% organic revenue growth. We also expanded adjusted operating margins 20 basis points. Free cash flow was a negative $73 million, but consistent with our expectations given the normal seasonality for the quarter. Additionally, we paid $103 million in dividends and spent $417 million on share repurchases year-to-date.  Growth was led by North American Commercial and Residential HVAC. The teams here are doing a terrific job of share gain and margin expansion and we anticipate this momentum to continue through 2017. The Residential business had record quarter one revenue and margin performance combined with market share gains. Looking elsewhere geographically, we also had strong HVAC performance in China. Year-over-year organic revenue growth improved more than 20%.  Our Industrial businesses continue to maintain focus on delivering improved operating margins through increasing the service mix, new product development and cost reductions. Our Compression Technologies business, for example, realized the highest mix of services to equipment in its history with quarter one record revenue in bookings for global service agreements. Moving now to Slide 4. I wanted to spend a few minutes providing some color on how we're thinking about our key end markets and businesses on an organic growth basis. So far, 2017 is shaping up largely as we expected. The North American Commercial HVAC and Residential HVAC businesses showed strong growth in the first quarter and is expected to continue in 2017, driven by all areas of the business, including applied, ducted and ductless, unitary and residential equipment and building controls and services.  Our focus on sustainability is a growth driver here and our robust new product pipeline to provide highly efficient systems and expand our offerings for HVAC systems with next-generation refrigerants, for example, is having an impact on the business globally. It's allowing us to take share in regions like the Middle East where we have district cooling opportunities and in Europe where we can offer customers products and services ahead of regulatory deadlines.  For Ingersoll Rand, we continue to forecast mid-single-digit growth in Commercial HVAC in total and mid-single-digit growth in Residential HVAC, which is essentially a North American business for us.  Global industrial markets are generally improving and we saw that in quarter one. We're seeing more positive signs in our general industrial markets in the U.S. and the eurozone as PMIs have improved. We've also generally seen order improvement across our Industrial business. We have had year-on-year growth in orders in our Compression Technologies business for the past 4 consecutive months, which is encouraging. We continue to plan for a modest rise in Industrial production and a gradual recovery with bumps along the way. The large engineered compressor market is expected to show signs of improvement due to stabilizing activity in energy markets and heavy industry, and we saw some positive signs of this in the first quarter.  We still see year-over-year orders rising in 2017. Even with this though, we're still planning for revenue to decline due to depressed 2016 order levels and the average lead time of 12 to 18 months for this type of product. Excluding these longer lead time products, we expect our Industrial segment to be flat to slightly up.  We continue to expect the transport markets in the Americas to be down from lower volume for trailers and auxillary power units, partially offset by truck volumes. Transport in Europe is expected to be up modestly primarily based on truck and trailer sales. We expect continued growth in Asia Pacific and its relatively smaller base. Given the work we've done building out the Transport business into a more diversified and durable business, we expect to mitigate the impact from North American trailer declines and for revenues to be down low single digits.  Golf markets are expected to be flat and we expect to see some growth in our consumer and utility vehicle markets. The recently launched personal transportation vehicle I mentioned last quarter continues to perform well. Overall, we expect Club Car to be up low single digits. And for those attending at our upcoming Investor Day, you'll get a chance to experience one first-hand. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Sue to discuss the first quarter in more detail. Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike.  Please go to Slide #5. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points I'd like you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we have started 2017 on a strong note with continued strong bookings growth, organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin improvement, adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow in line with our expectations. Our results are on track at this stage in the year with continued strong bookings growth and we're, therefore, adjusting our full year earnings per share guidance up $0.05 at the bottom end of the range as Mike discussed earlier. We have a detailed breakout of our guidance for your review in a few slides.  Our bookings and revenue performance were both strong with growth in both segments. Commercial and Residential HVAC led the way, both with high single-digit growth in bookings and revenues. Adjusted operating margins also expanded in both businesses. We were pleased with our Industrial business performance, which is demonstrating steady adjusted operating margin improvement. We continue to take additional actions on operational excellence initiatives, increased commercial focus on aftermarket parts and service offerings and took additional cost reduction actions to improve operating results going forward. We also drove strong organic bookings growth in the quarter on both equipment and services, which was encouraging.  Earlier in the year, we identified our dynamic capital allocation priorities for 2017, including spending $1.5 billion on a combination of share buybacks and acquisitions and approximately another $415 million on dividends. Year-to-date, we can report we've spent $417 million on share buybacks and $103 million in dividends. We also made one modest size acquisition. We are continuing to follow the capital deployment plan we announced in January.  Please go to Slide 6. Our focus on execution of our strategy and operational excellence drove solid year-over-year performance. Net revenues were up 4% organically and adjusted operating margins improved 20 basis points. Strength in revenue performance was driven by our Climate segment, while operating margin improvement was broad-based across our Climate and our Industrial segments.  Please go to Slide 7. Organic orders were strong in the first quarter, up 7%, with strong results in both our HVAC and Industrial businesses. Climate bookings strength was broad based with growth across the globe and up 6% overall. Organic Commercial HVAC bookings were up low-teens in equipment with strong results from both unitary and applied products. Residential bookings, again, showed strong growth, up high single digits and continued share gain. We also drove good growth in parts, service and controls, which is helping us to build a more sustainable business by increasing our income from recurring income streams.  Transport organic bookings were down low single digits, primarily driven by the expected decline in North America refrigerated trailers. Our diversification strategy enabled us to partially offset the decline in trailers through growth in truck and international bookings in the quarter.  The Industrial businesses bookings were up 9% organically in the quarter, led by strength in Compression Technologies and small electric vehicles. In Compression Technologies, we saw solid growth in both the long lead engineered to order business, which were coming off a weak first quarter of 2016, as well as in our small to mid-sized shorter cycle products. In electric vehicles, we are seeing good growth in our new consumer vehicle, Onward.  Please go to Slide #8. In our Climate segment, organic revenue was up high single digits in North America and Asia and up mid-single digits in Latin America. Climate organic revenues were down marginally in Europe and down high single digits in the Middle East off a small base. In our Industrial segment, overall organic performance was up slightly. Modest declines in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa were offset by improvements in Latin America and Asia. Overall, North America revenues were up mid-single digits and international revenues were up low single digits, netting a positive 4% organic revenue growth rate for the enterprise.  Please go to Slide #9. Q1 adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points, primarily driven by strong volume and productivity, partially offset by material and other inflation. We continue to make significant investments in business innovation and operational excellence to further improve our competitive positioning.  Please go to Slide #10. Overall Climate performance was strong in the quarter with organic revenues up 6% and adjusted operating margins up 70 basis points to 10.6%. Strong revenue growth in both Commercial and Residential HVAC was partially offset by Transport revenues, which were down mid-single digits in the quarter, primarily due to softening North America trailer and auxiliary power unit markets, partially offset by growth in aftermarket and in Asia. Climate adjusted operating margins expanded 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by strong execution across the Climate businesses. The impact of higher volumes, productivity and price far exceeded headwinds from material inflation, ongoing business investments and other inflation.  Please go to Slide #11. Our commercial focus on aftermarket, operational excellence initiatives and cost-cutting measures continued to drive operating margin improvement in industrial in the first quarter. Industrial adjusted margins increased 60 basis points on slightly higher organic revenues. Aftermarket growth was solid, more than offsetting modest declines in compressor equipment. Adjusted operating income and depreciation and amortization was higher by 100 basis points.  Please go to Slide #12. Free cash flow was negative in the quarter, consistent with our expectations and normal seasonality. Our guidance for free cash flow remains unchanged from the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion range we provided in January. Additionally, our balance sheet remains strong and gives us optionality as our markets continue to evolve. Please go to Slide #13. Our expected 2017 cash flow continues to enable us to drive a dynamic capital allocation strategy, employing capital where it earns the best returns. In our 2017 guidance, we highlighted our capital allocation priorities. The first was investing in our business as our number one priority. These include investments in innovation and in strategic growth programs. As I moved through the earlier slides, I discussed investment in the business multiple times as it's at the heart of our innovation, growth and margin expansion story.  The secondary is maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're BBB-rated today and believe this is the appropriate structure for the company.  The third area is our commitment to paying a competitive dividend. We've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised this dividend over time. In fact, the compound annual growth rate of our dividend is 20% over the last 5 years.  The fourth priority is strategic acquisitions and share repurchases and not necessarily in that order. In 2017, we committed to spend $1.5 billion between these 2 areas and, year-to-date, we've spent $417 million on share repurchases and a modest incremental amount on a key strategic acquisition in the Climate space. We intend to spend the balance of the $1.5 billion during the remainder of 2017. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through a dynamic capital allocation strategy as we've consistently done for years. Please go to Slide 15. As discussed earlier, while it's still early in the year, our first quarter performance gives us confidence in raising the low end of our earnings per share guidance by $0.05. We have largely maintained the other elements of our guidance for the year so the next few charts will be similar compared to the ones we covered in January.  The main thing I'd like to point out on Slide #15 is that our operating margin guidance targets have gone up somewhat to reflect the new pension accounting treatment that moves a portion of the cost from the operating line to the other income and expense line below operating income. Net adjusted margins rise by about 10 basis points for each segment and 20 basis points across the enterprise. We provided current and restated numbers in our news release tables that outline the impact of the change in more detail.  The difference between our organic and reported revenue contemplates about 1 percentage point of negative foreign exchange from a strengthening U.S. dollar outlook. We continue to expect Climate revenue to be up approximately 4% organically and for Industrial revenue to be down approximately 1% organically, which is consistent with our prior guidance.  Please go to Slide #16. We've raised the low end of our continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2017 to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.50, excluding about $0.15 of restructuring. We had a large planned restructuring charge of $0.10 in the first quarter related to the consolidation of 3 plants to further optimize our footprint. We have a number of actions we forecast taking for the balance of the year, but we think approximately $0.15 for the year is still our best estimate at this time.  Please go to Slide #17. There are 2 FASB accounting changes we adopted January 1, 2017 and want to make you aware of them. First, we were required to adopt Accounting Standard Update 2016-09 in the first quarter. The primary change is to recognize in the P&L any tax windfall or shortfall from stock option exercises and stock vesting where previous recognition was deferred to the balance sheet. Our planned adoption of the new accounting standard was built into the 2017 guidance we provided in January and increases the effective tax rate volatility versus the prior accounting.  In the first quarter of 2017, we recognized a noncash tax windfall of approximately $15 million, which is reflected at the benefit to our tax expense and effective tax rate. Our full year effective tax rate guidance of 21% to 22% includes the $15 million benefit recognized in the first quarter and anticipates a much smaller benefit to be earned in the rest of the year. Excess tax benefits that were not previously recognized in December 2016 were also $15 million. This amount was reclassified to retained earnings as of January 1, 2017 with no impact to the P&L per the new standard.  The second accounting change is related to pension and postretirement benefits. The new standard, ASU 2017-07, impacts where certain components of pension and postretirement benefit expense is recorded in the income statement. However, there's no change to net earnings or earnings per share. Under the new accounting standard, the traditionally more volatile components of benefit expense are now reported in other income and expense, including interest cost, expected return on assets and amortization of deferred amounts. Service costs remain in operating income as it represents the services rendered in the current period by participants of these plans.  We adopted this accounting standard in the first quarter of 2017 and re-classed approximately $8 million to other income and expense in the first quarter. 2016 amounts have been revised for comparability and were approximately the same amount in Q1 of 2016. Our 2017 estimate of expenses to be re-classed from operating income to other income and expense is $26 million. Please go to Slide #18. Our Q1 spend for planned restructuring was approximately $33 million related to consolidating 3 manufacturing plants and distributing the products to other facilities in the same region. Facilities were in both our Climate and Industrial segments. The actions further our region of use philosophy to localize manufacturing and the supply chain to help us achieve greater speed to market and implement local product preferences. We expect to spend approximately $0.15 per share for total restructuring expense for full year 2017. Our corporate costs of $68 million for Q1 were generally consistent with our initial forecast for the quarter and were higher than last year due to planned incubator investments in technologies that benefit all businesses. These investments are heavier in the first half of the year versus the second half. We also had an increase in other employee benefits and stock-based compensation timing. We continue to expect full year corporate spend to total $240 million for the year.  Please go to Slide #20. As we've done for the last couple of quarters, I'll comment on a few topics that we know are of interest to you before we open it up for questions. I'll first touch on currency as a headwind for us in 2017. About 35% or $4.8 billion of our revenues are outside the U.S. Our 2017 forecast has built in the continuing strength of the U.S. dollar, which will impact us most notably in the euro and Asian currencies. Overall, we continue to expect a 1% drag on our revenues from currency translation, which will have about a $0.10 negative impact on our earnings per share.  We also know price and material inflation is top-of-mind. Price was positive for us in the first quarter in both segments. Material inflation offset positive price driven by steel and Tier 2 components. We have 10 basis points positive price covering material inflation in our guidance. We've been through various cycles and have a strong history of capturing price to material inflation. For 2017, we expect a negative first half price to material inflation gap and expect to recover in the second half.  Please go to Slide 21. Covering our Transport business, we are on track with expectations. For 2017 overall, we continue to expect Thermo King revenues to be down low single digits year-over-year. The North America trailer industry is expected to be down. We're also expecting a continuation for relatively soft market for auxiliary power units and marine containers. Those declines will be partially offset by gains in Europe, Asia and aftermarket revenues. Through restructuring and efficiency, we would expect only a minor erosion of record of 2016 operating margins.  And finally, I know we'll receive questions on the status of Industrial. Industrial drove strong first quarter organic bookings, up 9%, and organic revenue growth was a result of significant aftermarket growth in the Compression Technologies business and continued growth at Club Car. Looking at a regional perspective, organic revenue growth in Asia and Latin America was partially offset by declines in North America and Europe, Middle East and Africa.  As we indicated earlier, we expect the Industrial markets to stabilize in 2017, although we cannot declare a definitive turning point yet on large equipment. Excluding large compressors, we expect Industrial to be flat to slightly up and we do expect to realize margin expansion through our operational excellence initiatives, ongoing cost reductions, restructuring actions and new product launches.  And now, I'll turn it over to Mike for closing remarks. Michael Lamach : Thank you, Sue.  So closing on Slide 22, we are executing on our 2017 plan and building a thriving, more valuable Ingersoll- Rand. I began today's call talking about our principled approach, the values inherent in our culture and how that translates to sustainability of our business. I'm proud of our employees who delivered a strong quarter one performance. I'm proud that we tackled challenging customer problems and we solved them. We take on tough issues and apply some of the best minds in the industry to solve them. Within our company, we have some of the most impressive emissions reductions and efficiency stories in the world. It's what we excel at.  Looking ahead, our strategy is unchanged. We will maximize growth through innovation and channel expansion, continue our focus on productivity and costs, deliver strong cash flow with disciplined capital allocation. Our Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses are strong and focused on growth areas with equipment, controls and service. Our Transport Refrigeration business is diverse and agile and will execute their strategy as they typically do. Our Industrial businesses are focused on market share and margin expansion as markets stabilize. And our culture remains as strong as ever. As a result, I'm confident that we will continue to deliver top tier financial and operating performance. And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just my first question would be, again, on that point that Sue just touched on around the Industrial business. So should we think about the long lead time business being about $200 million of sales probably down high single digits this year? Is that about the right scale of the piece within Industrial that's offsetting everything else? Susan Carter : Yes, Julian. It's Sue. I think that's right. It's a little heavier than $200 million, but not significantly. So -- and I think what you have to think about there, and I know you are, is that bookings in that area last year was really the largest point of decline in -- especially the Compression Technologies business. So we saw some positive bookings in the first quarter, but those are going to translate into 2018, but you've got the right order of magnitude. Julian Mitchell : And then, just my second question would be around the transport market. When we're thinking about bookings here over the balance of the year, they were down, as you said, in the first quarter, up a little bit in the fourth. Should we expect bookings -- or are you expecting bookings to grow in that segment overall at any point this year? And if you could just remind us of the lead time in Thermo King from bookings to billings. Susan Carter : So let me start out with the bookings and the expectations. So we talked about in Q1 that the bookings were down slightly. One of the things that I'd like to point out in that area is they were actually down about 1% year-over-year, which translates to about $6 million. So we know that -- we knew that we were going to see the North America trailer markets down. We knew that we were going to have some strength in Europe in the truck markets. We also saw some strength in North America on truck with the marine business being down. So there's a little bit of a mixture there, but we do still see that the biggest market that, I guess, from a focused standpoint on North America trailer is that that's going to be down for the year. We're a little bit more conservative than ACT with their 44,000 units, but we are calling that down. Julian Mitchell : And then, just the lead time of bookings to billings? Michael Lamach : Julian, the timing there typically is going to be independent -- or dependent on the customer and what we're going to get there is sort of an indication of the order quantity for the year. And they're going to take those -- sort of, as they would see their fleets needing to be replenished so, that varies dramatically. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert McCarthy : That was sneaky. Rob McCarthy here. I guess, the question I have is with respect to the performance across Commercial HVAC and Residential HVAC. Could you just cite areas of where you're taking outside share? I mean, obviously the narrative has been of structural share restoration or share gain over the past several years, but could you just give us some principal examples because I think you called it out in your results? Michael Lamach : Yes. I think it's broad-based. Again, I mean, we looked at North American equipment bookings up roughly 20%. We're seeing applied North America up in the mid-20s. Success in the Middle East in terms of bookings. China was up significantly, 20-ish percent in the quarter as well. Controls continue to -- we're doing well with the Controls business and Service business. So really across the board, Robert, we're having success there. Anything specific you'd want to know more than that, then feel free to follow-up on it. Robert McCarthy : Yes. And then, I just -- could you talk about kind of your expectations for kind of incremental margin lift this year and conceptually going forward in terms of maybe puts and takes around incremental compensation expense or any other items we should be thinking about as we think about margin conversion here because we're coming out of a shoulder quarter and we're kind of going into the back half or the prime season, at least on the Climate side? Michael Lamach : Yes. I'll start and let Sue finish. But if you look at from operations leverage, around 25% of business, coming off last year is really toward a price to material deflation mix. It was really good performance in the quarter there. We think good performance on the long run is leveraging incrementals at the growth marks of the business and we would expect things to be in that 25 to 35 range and have no difference in expectation this year. Of course, Industrial, we'll leverage them much -- at a much higher rate. You saw that in the quarter where we had a slight decline in sales. We had an increase in operating income in that business and that will continue to be an outsized leverage there. Robert McCarthy : The third and final question is basically -- I hate to ask a banker question, but I'll ask the question nonetheless. I mean, you've executed very well. You've had strong growth in EPS revisions, but you do have this mix between Climate and Industrial. Maybe, Mike, you could talk about the commonality of why you can run the assets together because in this environment of conglomerates and de-conglomeratization, the -- an argument can be made you could sell or spend this entity in the strike. Some of your peers have looked or actually done this. And it might be a value creation event, particularly given with respect to what pure play Climate companies are trading at right now. Michael Lamach : Yes, Rob. We'll cover that really, I think, in more detail. There'll be more time in May, first of all, so I don't want to absorb too much time on that.  And clearly, we believe that what we're seeing today through the operational integration, this is both the technologies that we would have, the networks of excellence that we would have around engineering across the business, the purchasing power we have and even the plant consolidations, some of which we did in the quarter, consolidating more of these plants together in larger scale all lead to a pretty big dis-synergy number pulling it apart.  It's also the cash flow cyclicality inherent between the 2 businesses, and there's a bit of a negative correlation between Industrial and Climate historically for us anyway. And I think that, that is something that has bode well for the ability to continue to have strong cash flow, to allocate that toward investment in the business which is out of cycle, which you even saw, I think, today, we announced we've now launched that large rotary refresh of the oil flooded air compressor business. That was the project -- I don't know, 5 quarters ago, we talked about pulling forward, I think, in the 2015 versus '16 to accelerate it because we have such good success with the small air compressor using the same technology.  So that sort of thing wouldn't happen, I think, in this cycle. And that, again, if you flip it around and look back in the 2010, '13 time frame, all of the success in Industrial at the time fueled what you're seeing in the Trane business. So I think we look at that all the time. We try to understand some of the parts in the portfolio when we apply a range of dis-synergies against that. It's not a value-creating idea. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : I've got a few, I guess, [ molding ] questions probably for Sue here. So just thinking about -- you mentioned no significant debt maturities until 2018 and you've got a pretty big one, $750 million, at high cost, 6.75%, and you could refi that much, much lower interest rate today. So I'm just wondering how you're approaching that maturity? Are you looking to refi early? And what kind of rate do you think you could refi for? Because it looks like 6.75% could become 2%, so that's a significant savings. Any comments there would be helpful. Susan Carter : Well, so the maturity is August of 2018 and we're continually evaluating that. And I'll tell you what I'm balancing on that interest rate of 6.75% versus what we could get today. And I don't know if 2% is the right number, but let's assume that it's much lower than the 6.75% is. What's the right timing in terms of the breakage of cost that go along with it? So in other words, if I want to refi now and do that, there's going to be a cost associated with that. And while I could easily disclose that to you, I sort of have a bias towards protecting shareholder value and saying I'm not going to do that unless there is a really good reason to do that. So what drives a really good reason would be is if I thought the rates were going to change dramatically or I get more within the window. So continuously thinking about it, Nigel, but so far, we haven't pulled the trigger on that and we'll continue to look at it. But you're right, it would be lower interest than the 6.75%. Michael Lamach : Nigel, last time I looked at that was very really not long ago. Really, weeks ago, we were upside down some $10 million in that equation, a couple -- $0.03 a share and the only argument you can make would be do you do it early and protect the deductibility of interest on a scenario that you're guessing at around taxes. So really, guessing at that scenario for $10 million didn't make any sense, but I want to give you some color because you need to know we're looking at it all the time. We wouldn't leave an opportunity on the table like that. Nigel Coe : Right. I know it's just a big number. And then, I guess, going even deeper, Trane, you obviously called out in the slides the impact of D&A on margins and the Trane amortization starts to roll, I believe, in mid 2018. So I'm just wondering, is that about $100 million of intangibles that go away in mid '18? Susan Carter : So actually, what is sitting there in 2017 in terms of the Trane amortization is about 105,000 -- $105 million, which is about what you said. That actually does not start to roll off, Nigel, until, like, 2023. So it isn't going to start rolling off in 2018. It's going to be roughly the same $100 million. Nigel Coe : Okay. So 15 years, not 10 years. I got it. And then, just quickly on the restructuring mix, it makes sense to do the consolidation. I assume this is in the Industrial segments. Just wondering what sort of payback are you assuming? Michael Lamach : Well, actually, Nigel, it's across -- there was 3 different sorts of ideas. One was taking a residential light unitary North American factory and then putting that into 4 factories with open capacity. And so one of the things, I think, is a product of good productivity for a lot of years is opening free capacity in other locations, so one piece of that would have done to the HVAC side of the business. The second one was to the Industrial business and consolidating 2 plants in-country in Europe. And then, the third one was a plant in Europe which is going to be a multisegment plant in Europe. And so we really hit all 3. Nigel Coe : Got it. And the payback, expect 2 to 3 paybacks on those? Michael Lamach : You've got -- you sort of gap under 4 years, and cash under 2.5. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Just a question around -- I know you guys aren't giving quarterly guidance anymore, but you had said previously that 45-ish, I think, percent of the year was going to be in the first half. Is that kind of still the right number? Michael Lamach : Steve, I just won lunch, okay? And I'm not going to do any calculus or algebra on this one for you at all. I want to really stick to the guidance we gave, managing within that and let you guys sort of work. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. So then, I'll do the calculus. If you do 45% of the high end of the range and you take the $0.57 you did in the first quarter, that's getting you somewhere in the range of $1.45, which is about a 4% increase over the second quarter of last year. I guess, I'll ask it this way. Is there -- I know there's a tax benefit this quarter, which is helpful. There's some other stuff. Is there anything else that you want to call out year-over-year that would unusually kind of depress that rate of growth? I mean, I would think that, that $1.45, maybe that's a good number. It's still above consensus. Just curious if there's anything on -- from a comp perspective because you obviously, here this quarter, absorb a pretty decent hit from price/cost in some investments, but again, the tax rate was favorable. So just curious as to if there's anything you want to call out to make sure you kind of calibrate people on the moving parts without doing algebra. Michael Lamach : Yes. To sort of maybe recharacterize the question in a way that I want to answer it, I would tell you that the way -- the reason in which we took up the low end of the range was just confidence we had in the bookings and really eliminating the risk on the low end of the range and feeling like we had a stronger backlog going in.  When you look at that mid-20s applied bookings that we had in Q1, look at the large plant in our process industrial bookings, which would have been mid-teens growth year-over-year, the Climate is probably 6 to 9 months. It's interesting because that's based on the availability of the customer to have the project ready for it. We build chillers now in a day. We used to have chiller lead times of 10 weeks. We now could do that in 10 days, give customers a 10-day lead time from order to delivery. But if you go to a large plant in our process side, same thing, 12 to 18 months. So those are largely pushing out to 18. But with that being said, some of the bookings will fall into the back half of the year and give us an opportunity to raise the low end of the range. You'd also ask a little bit about price and material cost. I'll let Sue kind of give you some color on that. Susan Carter : Yes. So I think, Steve, that would be one of the other areas that I would watch in the second quarter. So our material inflation in 2017 is coming primarily from steel and from Tier 2 commodities. As we go throughout the year, we've talked about the first half is going to be a tough compare to last year where we had a very positive spread between price and material inflation. On the material side itself, there's been some volatility, really postelection, in both steel, which will start to show up in the second quarter, as well as aluminum. And aluminum has a bigger impact on our Residential business than what some people might think. We actually use -- I'll give you a first quarter kind of anecdote where we used about 15x as much aluminum as we did copper in the Residential business in the first quarter. So we're more impacted by that. Having said all of that, we intend to be price positive throughout the year. We're watching the commodities. And we're also really, really focused on productivity and really offsetting any costs that we have. So monitoring all of the different pieces, but I'd really watch on materials. Michael Lamach : Yes. And maybe, Steve, just more color on that even. You look at the fact that we are getting positive price across the board, that's a good sign. Again, it's the steel, the Tier 2 components, the aluminum, which Sue said, we buy 15 to 1 pounds of aluminum to copper in our [ resbins ] for example. You get to quarter 2, the spreads are 120 basis points. We will still expect positive price and the same sorts of material inflation that we're seeing. And then, you get out to the back end of the year and it literally might take to the back end of the year to kind of flip that into the 10 basis point positive there, but I do believe we've got the strategies to do that. We've also got some excellent value engineering ideas going on right now, testing out and would be finalized this summer, where we would both be able to change some of the alloys and be able to change some of the gauge thickness of materials we're using. If those test out positively, then that's going to allow us to abate some of that material inflation toward the back end of the year. So we're working it and feel pretty good about getting there at the end of the year. C. Stephen Tusa : Wait, what's 120 basis points? Sorry, just a quick follow-up on that. You had 50 bps headwind this quarter. What is 120 again? Michael Lamach : I think Q2 last year, we're 120 basis points. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Scott Davis : So Steve's question is a good one. I -- If you're 120 basis points positive last year and now it's 50 basis points, 50 basis points off of that 120, so it's still 70 positive? Is that how I should read it? Or are we actually 50 negative? Or am I just dumb? It might be that. Michael Lamach : No, Scott. I appreciate the question. It's a headwind. I mean, we had to overcome a significant headwind in comps so that's the point we're making. Scott Davis : Okay. So it's headwind in comps. Okay. I get it. So you're not actually negative price/cost explicitly. It's just the comp. Okay.  I did see you were out there with a fair number of price increases on January 1, at least in the resi business. Were you able to realize those in January 1? Or was it just not enough to -- or not fast enough to offset materials as they continue to move? Michael Lamach : Yes. Remember, Scott, the vast majority of our company doesn't operate on a price list or a pricing. It's really the res business, some parts of light commercial, tools business to some extent. It starts to fall down pretty quick after that. Everything else is really putting a system together, a project together. And so you're really pricing more or less in real time, when the customer wants an order, and that's how we look at it.  So yes, we had price increases where we compete in markets where that's the norm. Where it's not the norm, that's where we've been working this whole top line margin expansion pricing work over time to make sure we understand how to price out into the future when we expect deliveries and try to get on top of that. Of course, as you get to these large long lead items, you're dealing with the fact that you're trying to price out and guess 9 to 18 months out into the future and, in some cases, what's happened hasn't been so much demand related from a commodity perspective, but in the case of aluminum, for example, it's very speculative in nature as to what's going on. Those are more difficult to predict. Scott Davis : Yes. Okay, but... Michael Lamach : But net-net -- we get there at the end of the year, I believe, in our -- marginally positive price versus material cost, with price being actually quite positive. Scott Davis : Again, no, I totally get it. Your comps are tough so can you just... Susan Carter : Can I just interject for just a second? On the second quarter, I still expect for us to be upside down on the price/cost equation. So there is a very tough comparison to the price/cost spread from the second quarter of last year, but I do expect second quarter to look somewhat like the first quarter of this year, price positive, but still seeing a negative spread between price and material inflation. Scott Davis : I totally get it. It just took me a while. Can you guys just remind us what Thermocold is? just -- I'm not familiar with that asset. Michael Lamach : Yes. Thermocold is a -- it's a ductless variable water flow product that -- we worked with this company over time to kind of help develop it and get into the market. It got to a point where it's getting very interesting for us. We acquired the business this quarter. Actually, bookings have doubled in the quarter since we've owned it. So it's an early success around that.  But what happens with some of the variable refrigerant flow systems is as you're pushing refrigerant around buildings, and many building codes don't allow either a flammable or a high concentration refrigerant to circulate in the building, so just for context, the VRF system might have twice the refrigerant charge than a conventional system and then you're pushing that higher pressures and you're pushing it through buildings where it's not pushed today. So in some places, the preference for when people want to go ductless is to have variable water flow versus refrigerant. So we're looking to really make sure that we've got a product for every application. And what we do is we apply products and systems to situations and we do that through our channel, and that's why it's important for us to have all products for all applications. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So, I guess, my first question is really on -- let's -- sticking with Industrial. It seems like your aftermarket business probably drove a lot of the kind of improvement. So maybe just help us understand a little bit of the progress that you've made to drive aftermarket and then what growth looks like, aftermarket versus equipment, going forward. Michael Lamach : Yes. Compression Technologies specifically and Club Car would be the 2 parts of Industrial I'd call out to be the strongest. And when you look at what we can control in the Compression Technology business, if we can't control CapEx of large equipment, which was evident to us a year plus ago, the move that we could make was to spend more time in the channel around the mix pushing to service. And Todd and that team had done just an outstanding job of putting what I would consider to be the operational excellence discipline into the sales management and sales functions. And so the amount of connectivity we have between customers and service, the share of wallet we have with those customers has increased. And just the sort of the whole pace and rigor around the sales management process has increased. So I couldn't be any happier with how they're kind of bringing that to the market.  And then, in Industrial, what you're seeing here is Club Car with mid-teens bookings, and that's led by everything outside of golf, frankly. Golf is a business where, globally, we've got roughly 50% market share. So all the growth opportunities that sit in that small electric vehicle market spit out in utility and in personal transportation vehicles, low-speed vehicles at the consumer level. And we're seeing good growth there. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. And, Mike, maybe if you could just touch on ex-Club Car, regionally your developed markets, both North America and Europe, down. A lot of the rates we've seen just across the Industrial landscape has been really good this quarter. And so maybe talk a little bit about the kind of regional disconnect that you're seeing in North America, Europe versus what you're seeing across other areas of the world because clearly you've got better growth outside of the developed market landscape today. Michael Lamach : Yes. I mean, again, I think when you see larger compressors come back into the mature economies, you're going to see great growth in leverage. And even without a high degree of revenue, you saw a good leverage in this quarter. But you've got China, which I consider to be a mature market. Here you saw really excellent kind of high single-digit, almost double-digit growth there in our Compression Technologies business. So China is an example where we really did see some strength and recovery. And it's supported not just by the reported GDP, but around energy use and the economy and by some of the usage of commodities like steel in the market would tell us that you're seeing something that appears to be a turning point in China and hopefully will last. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : So through April, you spent $417 million on repurchases. Obviously, you've ramped up repurchases especially in April. You do seem committed to your $1.5 billion target. But can you talk about the probability of doing M&A versus repurchases? Are valuations higher to the point where the chance of doing bigger M&A are lower? Do you still see significant opportunities in your pipeline? And then, at what point in the year do you actually step up repurchases if M&A is a little harder to come by and is that happening now? Michael Lamach : Yes. I'd just start with -- from the beginning which says that the strategic plans that we put together in the company would have isolated some ideas around targets that we want to go after and that list of targets would have yielded some specific targets that we would have put on our list, whether they're actionable or not, and you could say, well, everything is actionable at any given price, but the reality is it's not actionable within the financial guidelines that we put in place about what we think a good acquisition looks like. So when you start with that, you say to yourself, from there, at any one given point in time in the pipeline, what do we feel is both actionable and actionable at a level financially that we think would be attractive to us. If I snapped the line today -- I want to be very careful about this because it could change next week and it would have been different last week. But if I snapped the line today, I would say that it's between $300 million and $500 million of actionable M&A that meets our financial constraints and hurdles across the company. So that doesn't mean that it won't change next week. It wouldn't preclude doing much larger deals if they fit the strategic plans that we put in place and the target list that were in place at the time, but that's where we are today. And if you ask me next quarter, I'll snap a line for you and tell you where we are, I suppose. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, that's very helpful. And then, just shifting gears, can you talk about your Commercial HVAC markets in EMEA and Asia? You mentioned last quarter, your 2017 outlook was relatively flattish, but you did see strong 4Q Asian orders. You said they were lumpy last quarter, but you continue to see good order growth in both markets really and you did raise your forecast a bit for Asian HVAC. EMEA orders didn't look like they accelerated a bit in the quarter, so can you see some upside in EMEA and Asian HVAC as we go through the year? Michael Lamach : Well, the Middle East really accelerated for us and that was kind of mid-teens bookings growth in the Middle East for us, so very different than what we're seeing in Europe. in Europe, we're not bearish on Europe. We just think it's going to be a sort of a flattish market. But the Middle East, we would think to be up for the year for us. And I think that's not the market, I think, that we're doing some good things in the market, particularly around some of the district cooling plants and the newer refrigerants that we've launched into the market.  China was also just a good story for us. And again, it's really a quarter at this point. I'm not going to say that -- expect that to continue through the balance of the year, but clearly, the market in China specifically, I don't think was up 20% in the quarter, but we had strong bookings growth in the quarter. Again, a lot of new product introduction, more depth in the channel and I think just solid execution across the board there. Andrew Kaplowitz : You said the Middle East market, it was more you than the market. Did it stabilize though and that allowed you to outperform more in the quarter? Michael Lamach : I was there just a month ago, at least where I was, okay, but specifically Dubai would be a point I would raise. I would tell you that it was booming and really no signs of slowing down there. Obviously, as you get outside of Dubai, you're going to reach different dynamics, but we would have seen that our team there is sort of feeling good about what they're able to bring in into the market with new product and services, controls, performance contracting and capability. The team becoming, I think, stronger there to the point where we can do more work outside of equipment, that's helping us to grow the market. We've got a joint venture we're starting there as well soon. I think that will help us develop in the market further though. So again, I didn't see a terribly depressed situation in the marketplace, but I felt good leaving that trip, understanding what our growth plans were and feeling good about our ability to get growth where it's maybe flattish today or down. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : Mike, I'd love to hear your comments about the build ahead of the cooling season. How does the inventory in the channel stand today and maybe your sense about customer bias towards replacing versus fixing their units just given the sentiment today? Michael Lamach : Yes, Deane. Really, detailed about sort of inventories. There's nothing unusual about inventories in the channel. I know some of the folks that are sort of more res-based and maybe similar folks in HVAC are looking at weather and days of sales and so on and so forth, but honestly we're not seeing anything unusual here. We're seeing good strong markets. We're seeing the replacement market is strong. We're seeing the new construction market is strong and a couple of areas that we're really looking to penetrate, which should be areas like new construction or areas like owned or non-occupied, are markets that are really growing for us. And we focus the channel, we focused our work in those markets. So I think it's shaping up to be another strong, solid year for the res markets. And clearly, we're doing well in those markets. And it's also you're seeing the nice market share growth and margin expansion. It's not as if we're in there buying share at all. It's really a well, strong -- a well-functioning business, strong management team executing well on its plan. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. Can you just provide some color on where you think you're gaining share on the resi market? In particular, product lines or just where you think that growth is coming? Michael Lamach : We're, in the last 3 years, about 100% revitalized. So there's nothing in the market that we have in the market for very long. So who we're taking share from -- we speculate internally, but I certainly wouldn't want to put a public proclamation around that hypothesis. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Just a couple of loose ends, I guess, here. Mike, what are you seeing, if anything, on the competitive response to your share gains? I think a lot of it goes to your -- the point you just made about you're winning on product, but is anyone else coming back on you on price? Do you see anyone kind of acting out of line? Michael Lamach : We work in an industry with a handful of large players. It's probably going to consolidate over time and we certainly don't discount any of our competitors' capabilities in these areas. It's a strategy, Jeff, that we've had for a long time about how we wanted to win and where to play. The product growth teams are very additive to what we're doing in trying to isolate opportunities or weaknesses and exploit them. So yes, I said the context of the word culture, I don't know, 5 times on the opening script and I can tell you that there's something about really embedding that pretty deeply in the organization that we wake up every day thinking about market share and margin expansion and we're supporting that with the field, with great service capability, with a tremendous amount of investment, innovation in products controls services across the board. So we just got to run faster and we've got big, strong competitors that are running fast, too. Jeffrey Sprague : And just kind of a separate thought. We've heard a couple of times this earnings season just maybe some companies have over-restructured, some pinch points in the supply chain. With things looking like it's broadly picking up, is there anything in your supply chain that looks problematic, anything you might have to vertically integrate to kind of contend with such issues or anything you're monitoring? It's just interesting. Michael Lamach : Knock on wood, Jeff, we've had an excellent season. I think every season just gets better and better. The first thing we do at the end of the season is we debrief every learning we had in the season at a very deep level on a plant and product basis and understand sort of what we would have done if we could hit the replay button. And every year, we get better at that. It's why the profitability of the res business turned the corner in the first quarter, which historically, I think, forever had been in a loss-making position. It's now in a good position in the first quarter with less inventory, high returns, better cycle times, lead times to customers, more product availability. So we're not seeing anything here that we haven't planned for or thought about at this point, but again, this is not even May and we've got to go through a few more months here to be confident about that. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session.  I will now turn the call back to Zac Nagle for any closing remarks. Zac Nagle : I would like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As usual, Joe and I will be available to answer your questions today and the coming days and weeks.  We look forward to seeing many of you or connecting with you via the webcast at our investor and Analyst Day on May 10. And have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today.  Our first half results continue a strong track record of performance and position us well for the balance of 2017 and beyond as we look ahead to the 2018 to 2020 targets that we laid out in May at our Investor Day. First half performance is running ahead of our initial expectations and gives us confidence in raising our full year revenue guidance to approximately 4.5%; raising our adjusted continuing EPS guidance to approximately $4.50, which is at the high end of our previous range; and maintaining a strong cash flow guidance of free cash flow equal to or greater than 100% of net income.  Today, I'll start by discussing how focused execution of our strategy is delivering sustainable high levels of performance. I'll also provide comments on how our key end markets are shaping up for 2017. Sue will discuss our second quarter performance in more detail and address some topics we know are on the minds of investors and I'll then close with a brief summary before we take your questions.  Our overall strategy remains straightforward and we believe our people and culture are a source of competitive advantage. First, our business model is rooted in anticipating and addressing all the trends that impact the way we live, work and move. We focus on delivering outstanding products and services in durable growing markets. In our case, it's an orientation toward the importance of sustainability, enabled by technologies growing at exponential rates that will create new business models and sources of productivity in a world that will increasingly value the conservation of resources. We excel in delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food waste, preserving natural resources and generating productivity for our customers. It's what we do, that's what we're known for. We maintain a healthy level of investment in our businesses to sustain leading brands, which are #1 or #2 in virtually every market in which we participate.  Second, we excel at delivering strong top line, incremental margins and free cash flow through our business operating system. Our business operating system is continuously improving and underpins everything we do and enables us to constantly generate high levels of free cash flow, which powers our dynamic capital allocation strategy.  Our strategy once again served us well in the second quarter. We followed our business operating system to achieve outstanding organic revenue growth of 7% and adjusted continuing EPS of $1.49, an increase of 8%. We also expanded adjusted operating margin 40 basis points and generated $414 million in free cash flow. Our very strong revenue growth gives us great optionality to balance ongoing business investments for the long-term with meeting or beating our more near-term 2017 financial commitments. The larger categories in this investment include channel, infrastructure and new product development that position us in a way to continually improve our competitive position.  In the second quarter, the company delivered strong top line and bottom line results. We realized continued strength in the Climate segment, which reported an organic revenue up high single digits. Residential and North American Commercial HVAC led the company's growth and, as expected, we're also seeing steadying system improvement in our Industrial segment, which saw positive revenue growth and delivered strong margin expansion and order growth. This was the second consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth for Industrial. It was also a quarter marked by the launch of several product offerings. Compression Technologies and Services, for example, launched another model in the next-generation R-Series compressor family this quarter and its variable speed offering is up to 35% more efficient than the industry average. We just recently received external recognition with the Environmental Leader Product Award for its advances made in energy efficiency with the next generation R-Series line of the compressors. This is one great example out of 16 new products we launched in the quarter that demonstrate the kind of innovative, advanced offerings we offer our customers to build on our leadership position for the long run. We enable our customers to be both environmentally responsible and productive at the same time so customers are no longer obligated to choose one or the other. Moving to Slide 4. We changed our format a bit from our traditional market view to a midyear update that provides insights on how we're seeing the markets and our businesses now versus where we saw them when we provided our initial guidance in January. Based on the questions we've received leading up to this call, we believe you'll find the approach to be valuable. I'll touch on the primary areas that we've highlighted here as areas to watch so I'm going to keep it focused. It's not intended to be an update on every cut of the business here where we're seeing any element of change. So if we don't hit something here, we'll cover it in the Q&A session.  The first topic is volume and revenues, which have been stronger than expected. The North American and China Commercial HVAC and our North American Residential HVAC markets exceeded our initial expectations. Our North American Commercial HVAC Building Services business, for example, achieved record performance in Q2 with its highest revenue recorded and 9% revenue growth. Combined with the market share gains we enjoyed based on our product and service leadership and sales excellence in all critical components of our business operating system, we're seeing very strong revenue growth. While we see the potential for growth to moderate in the second half of the year, we forecast that we will continue to exceed our initial plan for the year. On an equally positive note, with Industrial, we're tracking to exceed our annual revenue plan there, too.  The next topic is the price to material inflation spread. Well before 2017 kicked off, we highlighted that we expected 2017 to be in an inflationary environment that, historically, we've been able to achieve a positive price material inflation spread of about 10 to 20 basis points. As we moved through the first quarter, the environment became increasingly inflationary, but still looked manageable to a 10 basis point positive spread if cost and pricing held steady. As we moved through the second quarter, material cost inflation has continued to persist and it's moved beyond steel and Tier 2 materials to all metals and into refrigerants. Because our volumes have exceeded our expectations, which we're pleased about, we're purchasing a higher percentage of commodities at current prices versus locked prices resulting in more inflationary headwinds.  We did achieve a positive price to material inflation spread in our Industrial segment and within our Residential business as well as in Transport in the second quarter. Our price to material inflationary headwind was in our Commercial HVAC business and mainly this was centered in the Asia, Middle East and Latin American regions.  Looking forward, it's important to note that we continue to expect to get positive price as we did in the second quarter. In fact, we expect to realize higher pricing as compared to last year and we believe this will continue through the balance of the year. However, we are planning around the assumption that price realization will be below our prior forecast in the second half. We believe it's prudent to plan for negative price to material cost spread similar to what we saw in the first half of the year and this is built into our updated guidance for approximately $4.50 a share.  The fourth topic is relative to our Transport business. At the beginning of the year, we indicated we believe the durability and diversity of the business would enable us to maintain modestly down revenues and margins based on expected declines in the North American trailer market and this has not changed, but the way we believe we'll get to the same result is a bit different. We're seeing modestly better results in North American trailers and softer results in our European trailer business as well as strong auxiliary power unit bookings as well as truck unit bookings and revenue. So in all, this is netting out to a relatively unchanged outlook for the Transport business.  The next topic is foreign exchange. Generally speaking, the dollar has been weaker than we originally forecasted, which is largely closing the gap between our reported results and our organic results, which is a benefit to us. It's meaningful to remember that operating margin currency translation historically flows through the P&L at a rate approximately half of what we pull through from operations. So overall, this is creating a modest impact to our leverage rates primarily on euro-based revenues.  Netting out all these updates, strong revenue and share gain combined with positive price and productivity, has enabled us to not only cover the cost to material inflation and other inflation, it's also enabled us to maintain high levels of investment in our business, which helps us maintain our momentum over the long-term. We expect that we will grow our business and expand margins again in the back half of the year, which gives us more confidence to raise our full year guidance to the high end of our previous range, with the same expectation on generating cash equal to or greater than net income and returning significant cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and pursuing accretive M&A where we can create value.  The future is very bright and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in 2017 and beyond. I hope that this has given you some important insights into how our outlook has evolved through the midpoint of the year. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Sue to discuss the first quarter in more detail. Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike.  Please go to Slide #5. I will begin with a summary of main points I'd like you to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we have exited the first half of 2017 on a strong note with continued strong financial and operational results. First half bookings growth, organic revenue growth, adjusted operating margin improvement, adjusted earnings per share growth and free cash flow are all on track or ahead of expectations at this stage in the year and give us confidence in raising our revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow guidance.  Our bookings and revenue performance were strong, with growth in both segments. Climate organic bookings and revenue were up 3% and 8%, respectively. Residential HVAC led the way with high-teens growth in bookings and revenues and improved operating margins. Commercial revenues were also healthy, up mid-single digits. Our Industrial segment continues on the path of steady improvement with strong bookings growth, revenue growth and a 250 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin. Excluding capitalized costs related to new product engineering and development of $8 million or 1.1 percentage points that were reclassified to the income statement in the second quarter of 2016, margins expanded by 140 basis points. These solid results give us further confidence in our full year guidance for the segment.  In January, we laid out our capital allocation priorities for 2017, including spending approximately $410 million on dividends and an additional $1.5 billion on a combination of share buybacks and acquisitions. Year-to-date through today, we've spent $667 million on share buybacks and $205 million in dividends. We've also spent approximately $65 million on acquisitions. We are continuing to follow the dynamic capital allocation plan we announced in January.  Please go to Slide #6. Focused execution of our business strategy underpinned by operational excellence drove strong year-over-year financial performance. Net revenues increased 7% organically, adjusted operating margins improved 40 basis points and adjusted earnings per share was higher by 8%. Robust revenue growth, positive price and productivity enabled us to more than offset increased material inflation pressures from metals and refrigerants while maintaining a healthy business investment.  Please go to Slide #7. Organic orders were strong in the second quarter, up 4%, with increased activity in both our HVAC and Industrial businesses. We do a particularly strong growth in Residential, up high-teens, driven by a robust market and continued market share gains. Organic Commercial HVAC bookings were down low single digits, impacted by a tough comparison to prior year when we booked a very large order in the North America Commercial HVAC Contracting business. Excluding this order, North America bookings would have been up 4% in the second quarter. Outside of North America Commercial HVAC, organic bookings were broad-based with high single-digit growth in EMEA and Asia. Transport organic bookings were up low single-digits with gains in North America, EMEA and Asia. Our diversification strategy enabled us to offset the decline in trailers through growth in worldwide truck, aftermarket and APUs in the quarter. Industrial organic bookings were up 5% in the quarter led by strength in Compression Technologies and Fluid Management. Regionally, North America and Europe were flat while we had strong growth in China, India and the Middle East and Africa.  Please go to Slide #8. In our Climate segment, organic revenue was up low-teens in both North America and China. Applied was up high single digits and unitary and aftermarket were both up mid-single digits. In our Industrial segment, overall organic revenue was up 2% led by high single-digit growth in North America and low single-digit growth in Asia. In our Compression Technology business, North America was up low to mid-teens in both equipment and parts and services and Asia also delivered strong equipment growth, up high single digits. Overall, North America revenues were up low-teens and international revenues were flat netting 7% organic growth rate for the enterprise.  Please go to Slide #9. Q2 adjusted operating margin improved 40 basis points primarily driven by strong volume, productivity and price, partially offset by material and other inflation. We continue to invest in the business. For Q2, approximately 40% of our investments were in new product development, 40% in channel optimization programs and 20% in OpEx on process and productivity-related projects to further improve our long-term competitive positioning.  Please go to Slide #10. Overall Climate performance was strong in the quarter with organic revenues up 8% and an adjusted operating margin of 16.8%. Strong revenue growth in both Commercial and Residential HVAC was partially offset by modestly lower Transport revenues. Climate adjusted operating margin was down slightly year-over-year. Significantly higher revenues, productivity and price were offset by headwinds from material inflation and a lower product mix of higher margin Transport revenues.  Please go to Slide #11. Our Industrial segment continued to show steady improvement in the second quarter. In addition to organic bookings growth of 5%, the business also drove organic revenue growth of 2% and adjusted operating margin improvement of 250 basis points. Our continued focus on improving the fundamental operations of the business through commercial focus on aftermarket, Operational Excellence initiatives and cost reduction measures is delivering tangible results. Please go to Slide #12. Free cash flow was $414 million for the second quarter driven largely by strong profit. Working capital as a percent of revenue for the quarter improved 50 basis points versus the second quarter of 2016. Year-to-date free cash flow is $340 million. Our guidance for free cash flow has been raised to approximately $1.2 billion, which is the high end of our previous range, reflecting continued expectations for free cash flow to be equal to or greater than net income. Additionally, our balance sheet continues to strengthen, which provides optionality as our markets continue to evolve.  Please go to Slide #13. Continued strong cash flows in 2017 enables us to drive a dynamic capital allocation strategy, employing capital where it earns the best returns. In January, we laid out our 2017 capital allocation priorities and they remain unchanged.  Our first priority is continuing to make high ROI investments in our business. These include investments in innovation and in strategic growth programs. These ongoing investments are at the heart of our innovation, growth and margin expansion story and our performance demonstrates our strategy is delivering results.  The second area is maintaining a strong balance sheet. We're BBB-rated today and believe this is the appropriate structure for the company at the present time.  The third area is our commitment to paying a highly competitive reliable dividend that grows at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. We've paid an annual dividend for 106 years and have consistently raised this dividend over the years. In fact, the compound annual growth rate of our dividend is 20% over the past 5 years.  The fourth priority is strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. In January of this year, we committed to spend $1.5 billion between these 2 areas and, year-to-date, we've spent approximately $667 million on share repurchases and approximately $65 million on acquisitions. We intend to spend the balance of the $1.5 billion during the remainder of 2017. Our pipeline of actionable and available acquisitions is approximately $300 million to $500 million at any given point in time. We will continue to create long-term value for our shareholders through a dynamic capital allocation strategy as we have consistently done for years.  Please go to Slide 15. Our strong first half financial performance gives us confidence in raising our 2017 adjusted continuing earnings per share guidance to the high end of our previously communicated range of approximately $4.50 per share. We have also raised our organic revenue guidance for the year from approximately 3% to approximately 4.5%, reflecting very strong revenues in the first half and expectations for continued healthy market growth and share gains in the second half. By segment, we expect Climate organic revenues to be up approximately 5.5% and Industrial organic revenues to be flat, both reflecting improvements versus our prior guidance.  Please go to Slide #16. This slide lays out our updated guidance versus our prior guidance in more detail. I'd note that our free cash flow guidance has been raised to approximately $1.2 billion, which is the high end of the previous range, reflecting continued expectations for free cash flow to be equal to or greater than net income.  Please go to Slide 18. We've received positive feedback on the section covering key topics we know are of interest to you in our prepared remarks so I'll cover a few such topics on the next couple of slides similar to what we've done in recent quarters.  The first topic is the expected impact of currency on our 2017 guidance. For the full year, we have been expecting roughly a $0.10 impact from a strengthening dollar primarily against the euro. At this point in the year, we're not expecting the dollar to strengthen as much as previously forecast, which has improved our currency impact from negative $0.10 to about a negative $0.02. We also expect currency to have a minor impact on revenues, which is reflected in our revised guidance. The next topic is our second quarter Climate segment leverage, which was lower than you might expect on the strong revenues we delivered. The primary factors impacting leverage in the second quarter in the Climate segment were persistent material cost and other inflation, unfavorable product mix from a lower mix of Transport revenues which carry relatively higher margins compared to the other Climate business and lower overseas margins than expected primarily tied to lower revenues. It is important to note that we continue to expect to see margin expansion in Commercial in the second half of 2017 and this is embedded in our guidance.  Please go to Slide 19. The last topic for today is the noncash, noneconomic negative discrete tax item of $33 million or negative $0.13 earnings per share we laid out in our earnings release this morning. This charge is related to the impairment of deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carryforwards in Latin America. It is important to note that while these assets are impaired, the net operating loss carryforwards remain available for future use if profitability exceeds our current projections so there's no current or future cash or economic impact to the company.  And I'll now turn it back to Mike for closing remarks. Michael Lamach : Thank you, Sue.  So in closing on Slide 20, we are executing our 2017 plan and building a thriving, more valuable Ingersoll Rand. I'm proud of our employees who successfully executed our strategy and delivered another strong financial and operational quarter for the company. We expect to see continued top-tier revenue and operating margin improvement in the back half of the year. Our robust revenue and booking performance gives us the optionality to make continued investments in the business to further improve our competitive positioning for the long run while, at the same time, raising our financial targets for 2017.  To summarize, our Climate segment remains strong, led by our Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses, which are focused on growth areas with equipment, controls and service. Our Transport Refrigeration business is diverse and agile and will execute their strategy as they typically do. Our Industrial business is on track and is delivering steady, consistent improvement. We have a tremendous depth of talented people and our culture remains as strong as ever. And taken together, I'm confident that, with this formula, we'll continue to deliver top-tier financial and operating performance.  And with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : So the tone on price cost definitely changed since the mid-May time frame at EPG. So I'm wondering, has there been deterioration in the price environment? I understand you talked about rest of the world commercial, but has there been deterioration in the pricing environment since that point? And on that topic, are you building a Section 232 impact in the second half of the year into your guidance? Michael Lamach : Yes. I'd start by saying, Nigel, that as far as price goes, most competitive pricing is happening where you've got overcapacity of OEMs in areas like China or there's some economic difficulty like the Middle East or Latin America. Surprisingly, there it's definitely more difficult. We've watched inflation persist. We've watched it move into refrigerants as an example into the second quarter. Now the volumes that we delivered were much higher than the volumes that we had forecasted so we ended up in the spot market to a much greater extent than we did sort of the hedged view of the world. So our look -- our outlook for the back half of the year now looks a lot like the first half of the year. We would expect sort of a 50 basis point -- 40, 50 basis point negative spread. So we think we're not expecting any more price. It's about the same amount of price as we've got in the first half of the year and a fairly conservative view around where we think direct -- or inflation goes. We're still going to raise margins in the back half of the year and we're going to do that and still continually invest in the company. And Climate would be a great example that even where it's holding true that price material inflation spread is the same as the back half of the year, the investments are about twice the rate they were in the first half of the year. So I think the formula pertaining to invest in growth and invest in productivity is just another area of the income statement for us to go attack as we would normally do, not just the price material inflation piece of the P&L. Susan Carter : And Nigel, if I could add just a few things to what Mike said and then I'll get to your follow-up question. So the answer to your question on whether we've seen more inflation in commodities than what we expected for 2017 is a definite yes and that inflation has come from steel. It's come from copper, turning from what we thought was a slight deflation for the year to an inflationary metric. Aluminum has been slightly inflationary and refrigerants have also been inflationary for the year and, in fact, refrigerants represent about 10% of our inflationary pressure for the year. Another thing that I would tell you though is that with the volumes that we've had in 2017 to-date, the increase also reflects some of the volumes that we've had where we've had to go out and buy it at spot. So it's a good problem and it's a great thing, but it has caused us increased inflationary pressure. And I would add just one more point on what Mike talked about with the Commercial HVAC regions where we're seeing not only pricing pressure, but also inflationary pressure with Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. These are some of our best businesses at managing the total P&L and productivity. So while these businesses are causing us some pressure on price cost, they also do a pretty good job of delivering their commitments by working the entire P&L, and I think that's what we'll continue to do as a total company for the remainder of the year. Nigel Coe : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, as a follow-on, just the North American Commercial, I think we understand the comp issue, but maybe just dig into the verticals in terms of where you're seeing the underlying strength and weakness. And specifically, we are picking up some signs of a slowdown in light commercial activity, maybe on the tendering side. Are you seeing that, Mike? Michael Lamach : First, Nigel, we've got to answer your 232 question and just really quickly on that. Steel prices, for us, are fairly well set now for the balance of the year. So between inventory and pricing that's out there, that rolls through the balance of the year. You would think we've got steel fairly well set in terms of our outlook for the balance of the year. Now going to markets, our view all along is that, at some point, you would see a positive but declining growth rate in the overall unitary market, particularly as it relates to commercial buildings. And I think that is definitely store outlook for the back half of the year, but offsetting that, we still think that we're sort of more in the early innings of the Applied business in the institutional markets and still have a nice pipeline moving through 2018 in that regard. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, so Industrial order growth was plus 9 in Q1, plus 5 in Q2. Revenue growth was also positive in both quarters. We know you want to be conservative, but why would organic growth and growth for the year just be flattish? I think we understand that some of the orders you're getting are for your large longleaf compressor that won't impact '17, but is there something else you're seeing in the Industrial business that keeps you conservative about your forward forecast? Michael Lamach : Well, for me, no. It's really looking at those large orders and the timing of that and then just looking at customer deliveries. So we had a, really a pleasant surprise in the first half of the year that the book-and-turn business was better than we had anticipated and we saw it across the board in Power Tools, Fluid Management and even in the consumer vehicle and Club Car. So there could be some upside to that number if the book-and-turn continues at the same rate, but what really drives the big revenue for us is -- are the bigger projects and we've got those scheduled out pretty tightly. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. That's helpful, Mike. And I wanted to follow-up on the Commercial HVAC orders that Nigel talked about. What was your internal expectation for the quarter? And then, how are you thinking about orders for the rest of the year? You've mentioned the improvement in Applied. Does that sort of accelerate as the year goes on? How should we look at that? Michael Lamach : Yes. We did great in the quarter. I mean, if you look back all last year, I think our bookings growth was double-digit so we're really coming off tough comps. What you're really seeing here is last year, at the same time, we booked a $100-plus million single contract. And we have those in the pipeline, but you can't predict exactly when they're going to fall. We don't bake the business around it. We don't determine our cost structure and investment schedules around whether or not that stuff comes or goes, but the markets have been strong, they remain strong. The shared data remains in our favor universally across all product categories, certainly in Service and across the globe. So we're happy with what's going on. We invested in growth and we feel like we're getting it, Andy. So I don't -- I'm as optimistic as I was coming into the year about the back half of the year in our Commercial HVAC business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So maybe touching on pricing for a second, the 50 basis points of negative price cost that you expect to occur in the second half of the year. I guess, one question is what constrains you at this point from pricing further in order for that to narrow into the second half knowing that commodity prices have increased? Susan Carter : Well, again, I think, Joe, the tough part of all of this is really looking at we've got announced price increases out there and what we're seeing move around is the inflation, but we'll also continue to see the price cost pressure in those regions of the world that we talked about with Asia, the Middle East -- actually, specifically China, the Middle East and Latin America. So we don't expect that to go away and we don't expect to be able to influence -- again, our steel is locked in for the back half of the year. The majority of our copper is locked in so we don't expect to be able to change that dynamic overall. And so what we can do as a company when we look at that back half of the year and the price cost spread is really just manage the entire P&L, make sure that we're really working on the productivity in the business, and you saw some of that in the second quarter, and also managing our costs in the right way. Michael Lamach : Yes, Joe. Remember, too, that every single part of the company with the exception of Commercial HVAC had price that exceeded material inflation. If you focus solely on Commercial HVAC, it's much easier to maintain that price cost relationship in the unitary business than it, say, would be in the Applied business. We're at pricing today, 6, 9, 12 months out into the future. So if inflation shoots up dramatically in case of refrigerants as an example, which are used extensively in great volumes in applied equipment, you're going to see that you didn't cover it. So it's really isolated to that Commercial HVAC business and, again, to the markets that are most competitive and into a larger equipment where you sometimes have a hard time getting in front of it when it moves up dramatically for really no reason. Joseph Ritchie : That's helpful color. I guess, maybe following up on that, Mike, you mentioned that price was positive really kind of across the portfolio with the exception of Commercial HVAC. If you were to maybe kind of give us a little bit more color on 2Q specifically around the incremental margins within Climate, so specifically on Commercial HVAC, Residential and Thermo King, just how did the incremental margins look for those different pieces of the business within the quarter? Michael Lamach : Well, we would have been highest in Residential where we, again, are expanding margins, I think, dramatically there and lowest in the Commercial HVAC business where in parts of the world you might have had deleverage on growth, growth and volume would deleverage. Again, these would be areas -- I'm thinking about China, parts of the Middle East where that would have happened. And then, within the TK business, we would have seen even a mixed swing where most of the growth in Europe happened in Eastern Europe, not in Western Europe. So we end up with a little bit of a regional cut there, which hurts things. Sue, anything you want to add to that? Susan Carter : Yes. So -- and I think that's exactly right is that your -- the top incremental leverage came out of the Residential business followed by Commercial North America, EMEA and then offset by some of those areas where we've talked about the price cost was definitely an issue. And then, to Mike's point on TK, we did have a mix down in -- first of all, from TK, which generally has higher margins than the other Climate businesses, but also from some of their European sales, which were lower margin type of sales and not in the truck and trailer where we've got great margins, so just a temporary mix down on TK. Michael Lamach : Joe, one thing, too, just interesting that we were talking about was if you look at the Parts business specifically, the Parts business is actually growing but quite slowly, just above low single digits, really low single digits. And you're seeing just a ton more replacement, whether it's on the Residential side or even on the sort of the Commercial side of the business where high margin Parts business is being -- obviously people are replacing rather than repairing. That's happening across the portfolio, too. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : So if you kind of roll on a 12-month basis the Commercial HVAC orders, you're kind of in that mid to high single digit range. I mean, I know you've talked about a slowing and given there is, I would assume, a little bit more of a longer lead time on some of these bookings in Commercial HVAC, any color on kind of whether this quarter is kind of a true break in the trend? Or should we expect, given the -- maybe it's an easier comp in the third quarter because of a large deal, maybe they weren't large or maybe they were, maybe you could kind of clarify that, should we be in that -- back in that kind of 4 to 5, perhaps, mid-single-digit type of range in orders in the third quarter for Commercial HVAC? Michael Lamach : Yes. I think the market is actually going to grow in that mid-single-digit range so that's the market in North America. As it stands, I mean, I think, Steve, slower unitary growth and accelerating Applied growth with the wild card being these larger energy services projects that we do at times that can impact the data. So that mid-single-digit growth rate, say, a healthy growth rate and if you can do any better than that, you're probably gaining share. Susan Carter : And we did have -- Steve, we did have a -- one of the contracting bookings in the third quarter of 2016 also. It was about half the size of the one in Q2, but it was still a good size so you'll have a little bit of a tough compare. But as Mike said earlier, we'll have tough compares on the Commercial HVAC bookings all year. C. Stephen Tusa : Right. But the quoting activity is holding up okay, I guess, is the messaging? Michael Lamach : Particularly on the Applied side, institutional side, absolutely yes. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. So if -- I guess, if you look at kind of the margin bridge for the second half, you talked about -- or at least for the year now, kind of to reset us. You said, basically, the rest of the year is going to look a lot like 2Q, so in the back half of the year, up roughly 40 basis points. Is that the right way to look at it? Michael Lamach : Yes, that's exactly right. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then, in the fourth quarter, you had -- it wasn't like the greatest margin performance on the planet. I mean, I think they were down and you did have some inflation kick in, in the fourth quarter. It was a 40 basis point headwind. Why wouldn't that comp get a little bit easier or is that just timing of raws coming in? And then, why are you not getting more price in the second half? Why -- you said you're going to put some things through. Is it just those markets are too tough in international Commercial? Michael Lamach : Second half investments are about twice the rate of the first half investments we're making and really trying to set up 2018 and beyond, Steve. So really on the margin side, yes, we could certainly squeeze more leverage out if we took that down, but we think we've got ideas and good projects to do that. Sue, the other part of the question, anything you want to add there? Susan Carter : Yes. So you're right, Steve. As you get into the fourth quarter, the comparisons on price cost are -- start to lap themselves because that was the first quarter that we saw the negative impact in 2016. But for the entire year, which was the guidance we gave in the prepared remarks, we still expect to be down about 40 basis points for the year based on what we've seen in the first half and then what we're projecting for the second half. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Just a question on the productivity and other inflation line within the margin bridge. Maybe just give us a sense of sort of where you stand on the outlook for that. That had been a very big margin driver, 2014 and '15, sort of flattened out last year, back to being a good tailwind this year. So is that sort of 60, 70 bps range what we should expect in the second half? Or are you thinking about trying to step that up to offset potentially a price material headwind that could last some time into next year? Michael Lamach : Yes. Total productivity steps up in the back half of the year for sure and that's programmed in, so those are projects that are in flight. So I feel that's pretty near in for us, a quarter or 2 out, to go look at that and that's certainly part of how we're trying to ensure that we still grow operating margin in the back half of the year and, again, sort of 30 to 50 basis points for the full year as well. But that's a good pick up, Julian. That's exactly right. Julian Mitchell : And then, just a follow-up on -- my second question would be on the Industrial business. The very good margin performance in the first half guidance suggests a flattening out in the second half. So was there any kind of big timing of productivity efforts or particular mix tailwind you had in Industrial in Q2 or the first half that you think doesn't sustain into the back half? Or is the margin guide in that division, really sort of heavily in the context of, look, you had a few tough years there, don't want to get ahead of yourselves on the recovery in margins? Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, price volume mix was all a little bit better than what we had thought so that was certainly a positive, but there's been a lot of productivity work over the last 18 months, 2 years in that business and we're seeing some of the highest productivity now in the company coming through as a result of that. Some of that has been restructuring and other elements have just been changes to the business model that we've made. So it's been an excellent performance to date. We think it will continue, but what's a bit of a wild card is just where we think price would really -- I'm sorry, where volume settles out for the back half of the year in terms of how much we can actually ship in the back half of the year. Susan Carter : And we did, Julian, in 2016, we did see the margin start to improve in the back half of the year in Industrial. So again, the first half comparisons are going to be a little bit easier than the second half comparisons. But as I look at every line item for the business, they're continuing to improve in the second half of the year, all the way down the P&L. So I think the business is doing exactly what we expected and want it to do in 2017. Michael Lamach : And I've got a lot of just personal confidence the way that, that team is executing through, Julian. They're delivering on exactly what was committed to on our May Investor Day. And it said through the operating reviews, you just see the cadence there and the delivery has been commensurate with that. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Yes. I just wanted to understand a little bit of volume mix in the second half. If I look at the -- I guess, if I look at that tax benefit for the second half and if I overlay it with your commentary on pricing, it seems that, I think, FX offsets most of the pricing drag. And I just want to understand the leverage in the second half just a little bit better. I know you said there is some uncertainty about volume. Is that what's driving it? Or are you just being conservative on operating leverage? I just want to understand that. Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, the leverage is not that different in the first half. It's marginally better in the back half than the front half, but the largest difference really is in the investments area where, again, it's about twice the rate as the first half. Andrew Obin : Got you. That makes sense. And just a question on pricing. I think one of the themes this earnings season was that some deflationary pricing and distribution channel from online. I know that online is starting to make inroads on Residential side. What has been your experience with pricing on the Residential side in the U.S. as online is growing? Michael Lamach : So far, so good. If you remember in May, we talked about one of the things that consumers really asked for was more transparency in pricing. And so we launched and we're first to launch now, nationally, a model where we've worked with our dealers to be able to give homeowners a fairly tight range of what an installed system would look like. And we're seeing uptake on that from the web. We're seeing close rates that are well above what they were sort of in the conventional way. So look, I think that simplifying the consumer experience and being more transparent around that is a good thing and it's something that we intend to lead and/or participate in with other leading companies that think that way. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Barry from Susquehanna. Robert Barry : Just a follow-up on the price question. I understand the international dynamic in Applied, but why not go for a midyear price hike in Resi, especially since the market there seems so strong? Michael Lamach : Well, Resi is covering material inflation and expanding margins and we're growing share. I mean, I wish we would have got 20 basis points more growth. We could have said it was 20%. So I mean, we had a heck of a good quarter. I don't think we need to do anything different there other than continue to do what we're doing and execute the way we've been executing. So I feel like that's in good shape and I think the industry is in good shape. Robert Barry : Got you. And then, just on the investments, 2x, I think you said in the second half, but if inflation continues to track even higher outside of steel, which sounds fairly locked in, I mean, what are the thoughts on kind of flexing some of that up or down versus accepting some lower margin near-term? Michael Lamach : Just like that, we could manage the whole income statement to deliver on the commitment we gave at the beginning of the year. So we're halfway through the year. We're now at the top end of our guidance range, which is a good thing. And as long as we've got good investments for the long run, we're going to make those investments. So I think it's happened to us before where the fourth quarter has rolled around and there was an opportunity to do something good for the business in the long run and we've done that. So we're not going to sacrifice a quarter to make a consensus number, that's for sure, but we are going to go deliver on the commitments we've made, which we're doing this year and, hopefully, we can top those. Susan Carter : And Robert, I would add that one of the things that, I think, we do a good job of and are putting some tools into actually continue to improve on the investments is we look at the investments versus the financial criteria and the returns that they're going to give to us, not necessarily their impact. It does factor into the P&L and we're very conscious of that, but we're looking at each of the projects for how it fits into the strategy and what kind of returns it's going to bring over the 2020 guidance that we gave at our Investor Day. So I think that's something we do very well and we're very conscious of how that all fits together, but it isn't just a look at the P&L. It's also a look at strategy and the longer term plan that goes along with that. So I think we do that pretty well. Operator : Your next question will come from Tim Wojs from Baird. Timothy Wojs : I just had a clarification and then a question. Just on the share repurchase and the acquisition activity, the $1.5 billion that you talked about for this year. I just wanted to clarify that only the year-to-date numbers are actually in guidance? Michael Lamach : Yes. The year-to-date is where we were as of today in terms of share buyback. The acquisition, the $65 million is where we are in terms of buyback. The $1.5 million is still the commitment on total deployment. The $300 million to $500 million of actionable and affordable M&A is still what we're looking at. Although there's been changes within the pipeline, it's still $300 million to $500 million. If I snapped the line today as compared to last quarter, I would tell you that the biasing will be much more close to the $500 million than it would the $300 million. That would be the -- really the update I would give you here. Timothy Wojs : Okay. Great. And then, just on Thermo King, you've actually seen order growth in 2 of the last 3 quarters. And so is that business really at a bottom in your eyes? And against easier comparisons in the back half of the year and into 2018, could we actually start to see growth accelerate now in that business? Michael Lamach : Well, it's a very diverse business so you have to think about what part of Thermo King are you talking about and what we're seeing right now is really excellent growth in areas like auxiliary power unit bookings or in total aftermarket or in the total truck business. So remember that TK is not just a trailer business, but it's a Class 3 to 7 truck business so that business was up high teens for us, the truck business. We've got other in there, which is bus, rail and air. So there are a number of positives. And then, again, you're comping at a little better -- just a touch better North American market than we thought; a weaker EMEA than we thought, particularly Western Europe; a stronger Eastern Europe than we thought. That, we're just slightly right on -- slightly above where we thought we would be for the total year. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Robert McCarthy : I'm going to skip the breakup question. I figured you had enough of that one. Maybe a history lesson though in terms of bookings. Obviously, you've kind of re-triggered the presentation effectively this quarter, but just the context around the Commercial bookings maybe first half of this year. What would the overall growth and complexion would be because I think -- I hate to be pedantic or didactic, but I just want to -- you had a very tough compare at 1Q last year, incredible growth, so just maybe some clarity around the kind of the first half bookings to kind of underscore still the strength there. Michael Lamach : Yes. So quarter one, you'd add high single-digit global Commercial HVAC bookings. Quarter 2, pullout a $111 million single contract. You're up at 4.5% growth in quarter 2. And then, look, the outlook for the balance of the year continues to be strong so -- against tough comps so... Robert McCarthy : Yes. I mean, 1Q '16, I mean, you had pretty explosive Commercial bookings as I recall. I mean, it was kind of in that 15% to 20% range, if memory serves right, in North America. Michael Lamach : Well, quarter one of '16, but yes, you've got -- in North America, you've got into a 12% growth number compared to quarter 2 of last year. So that's probably what you're thinking about is the 12% from last year in quarter 2 in North America. Robert McCarthy : Yes. Well, no. I mean, I think good performance on very tough compares. And then, could you just like comment a little bit about the kind of volume assumptions you did have with respect to commodities? I mean, how did you outperform there in terms of what your volume assumptions were for the quarter versus what actual volumes were? Any kind of complexion around that? Michael Lamach : Yes. Robert, to go through the whole business that way would be difficult to do probably on the call, but again, we didn't plan on roughly 20% Residential HVAC growth in the quarter. We didn't plan on the Commercial unitary business delivering at the rates that it did. So the strategy there is working across our Commercial unitary business. We're growing nicely there. I mean, the North America Commercial unitary business in the quarter grew double-digit again. So we weren't forecasting double-digit again off a double-digit growth prior year in the Commercial North America unitary business. So we're just seeing strong markets and -- well above our projections. I mean, the really exciting thing for me is that we were able to execute on that flawlessly. We took that volume. We worked with suppliers. We ran our operations and plans set. Meaningfully higher revenues than we had thought and executed well. The only downside of that was you're out in the spot market picking up steel, copper and aluminum, but that's about it. Robert McCarthy : And then, finally, for '18, thinking about kind of the levels of investments that you've kind of highlighted this year and obviously the price of material headwinds, if we go into '18, obviously you're not giving guidance today, I understand that, but could we talk qualitatively about the factors that would suggest what kind of -- would you expect a return to kind of the incrementals on the Climate side of the house that we've expected to enjoy there if you see continued growth and we have a step up in the spend? Or maybe you can comment on the R&D and overall investment spending you've been doing and whether it's going to level off in '18? Michael Lamach : Yes. The long-range plans for the business is going out 3 years and capturing 2020. If you look at the growth side led by product road teams, the answer that we're always -- the question we're asking is what do we do to grow share and grow margins at the same time and projects that qualify for that by teams that execute well are going to be approved. And so if you look at it from the growth side, the incremental investments look like the last 3 years, we still have good ideas to go execute. On the productivity side, we're making sure that the productivity investments are sufficient enough to create a gap over other inflation, including wage, labor. So that's our operating system, that's our model, that's how we look at this always. As we look out, there's not a lot of difference about how you would model that for us. It would be incremental investment for growth and it would be incremental investment in productivity to offset other inflation. And then, price material, whole different part of the operating system. This will be a tough year. It's a bit of an unusual year, but I just don't think long-term that it's going to remain upside down for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Lots of ground to cover here. Just a couple of things. Mike, the growth in building services, does that reflect the beginning of the execution of the big profits you booked last year? And whether the answer is yes or no, are you building backlog in that business? Michael Lamach : Yes. The main area actually was in all of the other service areas, that would be everything from planned service to break fix to smaller turnkey contracting. And that's the return on investment for the feet on the street for all of the controls, people we put out in the marketplace to sell, all of the service technicians that we've grown. I want to say, in North America, we're up 200 to 300 technicians, maybe more at this point, year-over-year. We're seeing industry-leading revenue per technician and margin per technician. So again, it's a strategy of the business to continue to invest there -- at those higher margins. Jeffrey Sprague : So on the bigger projects, you're not even really starting to see revenue on those, correct? [indiscernible] Michael Lamach : Yes. They're so long in nature that they -- and they're fairly linear in terms of how you execute something like that. Typically, if it's an 80-building project, you're doing that in phases, in chunks and so it's kind of squeezing its way through the income statement. And some of those projects were 24, 26 months, maybe longer projects. So it happens over 2, 2.5 years. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And then, just kind of a technical one for Sue. I think you said FX only kind of half the fleet average margin rate. That sounds a little atypical relative to other companies I cover. Is there something with hedges working against that or some other kind of technicality that drives that phenomenon? Susan Carter : No. Actually, it doesn't. What it really reflects is our in-region, 4-region strategy. So in other words, your cost and your revenues are largely in the same currency. And so what that means is, is when you translate out the revenues that you're really translating the income at the operating income level. So it includes the cost side of that versus just at the gross margin level. So a bit of a nuance, but nothing more than straight math. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Wolfe Research. Joshua Pokrzywinski : I guess, first question, Mike, on some of the big performance contracting orders that you booked last year that set up a tough comp, I'm to understand those are fairly lower margin relative to the base business. Does that show up in an easier margin comp somewhere along the way that we should keep in mind as well? Michael Lamach : Well, it shows up in lower gross margins. It should show up in the contribution margin being about the same. So you tend to have all elements of cost set against that particular contract. So there's very little incremental, meaning the commissions and the sale are part of the cost structure of the contract. So we look at those to be accretive to the overall margins on a contribution basis, but it would put pressure on your gross margins for sure. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Is that something we lap here in the second half? Or is that just spread over multiple quarters? Michael Lamach : Well, it's a little bit to Jeff's question. So when you book these things, the $100 million point, you're getting a quarter -- a point where it can really move your comps on bookings, but if you take those projects over out -- over 24, 30 months, you're really seeing the P&L impact in 24ths, sort of 30ths over the course of that contract. So it's very much sort of diluted coming through the income statement over time. Does that help you at all? Joshua Pokrzywinski : Yes. That's helpful. And I guess, just a follow-up on another one of Jeff's questions on the currency front. A lot of companies we've seen have gotten pretty decent pricing over the last couple of years in a stronger dollar environment. Is that some of what's going on with the tougher pricing environment internationally, just maybe it's tougher to price your inflation given that you've already priced through currency? Is that dynamic playing out at all for you? Or it's because it's purely translational, that doesn't show up? Michael Lamach : So we tend to produce and sell in-region at those currencies. We do very little sort of exporting around the world in various currencies. The only exception to that is there's some Middle East orders that will come out of the U.S. as an example, but generally speaking, you're operating in the same currency. So to us, it's much, much more translational than it would be transactional. Susan Carter : Right. And I think, Josh, when you think about it, the -- in some of the areas that we've been talking about in the world, you're going to have a competitive pricing environment, so that's a given, and then you're going to be buying your raw materials in that region again, so you're going to locally source in China or some of the other countries. So you're not really -- you're getting both ends of that dynamic, whatever the region is telling you. So it's not really a translational or FX type of activity. It's really if you're manufacturing in the region, you're going to get the full cost side as well as the full revenue side. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Great. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us for today's call. We'll be available in the coming days and weeks for any follow-up calls that you might have. And we look forward to connecting with many of you soon. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ingersoll Rand Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's third quarter earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We're also recording and archiving this call on our website.  Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. The participants on this morning's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO.  With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll start this morning by discussing how focused execution of our strategy underpins our ability to deliver sustainable, high levels of performance over time. I'll also provide comments on how we're thinking about our business and our end markets broadly as we closeout solid performance in 2017 and move into what we expect to be another strong year in 2018. Sue will discuss our third quarter performance in more detail, and address some key topics we know that are on the minds of investors. And I'll then close with a brief summary before we take your questions. As I said on prior calls, our overall strategy remains straightforward. We believe our business operating system, people and culture are source of competitive advantage. First, our business strategy is grounded in anticipating and addressing global trends that positively impact many of the world's most pressing, sustainability challenges. We focus on delivering the most reliable, energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products and services in durable growing markets. In our case, it's an orientation toward the importance of sustainability, which is enabled by digital and other exponential technologies growing at dramatic rates that are enabling new business models and sources of productivity in a world that will increasingly value the conservation of resources. We excel at delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food waste, preserving natural resources and generating productivity for our customers. It's what we do and it's what we're known for. We maintain a healthy level of investment in our businesses to sustain leading brands, which are #1 or #2 in virtually every market in which we participate. Second, we excel at delivering strong top line, incremental margins and free cash flow through our business operating system. Our business operating system is continuously improving and underpins everything that we do. It enables us to consistently generate high levels of free cash flow, which powers our dynamic capital allocation strategy.  One example of our capital allocation strategy is the acquisition we entered into this week that strengthens our telematics portfolio, an important component of our connected technology strategy. Sue will cover this within topics of interest later in our call. Our year-to-date results continue our strong track record of performance and position us well for a solid finish to 2017 and strong momentum going into 2018. Sue will discuss the details of the quarter in a few minutes. So I'd like to turn my attention to discussing where we are at this stage in the year and how we're thinking about key aspects of our business going forward.  Moving to Slide 4. We're going to follow the format we started last quarter and discuss how 2017 is shaping up relative to our expectations, so you get a feel of how the landscape is evolving. I'll touch on some of the areas that may read through to 2018 as we're in the midst of our 2018 planning now, but I want to be clear upfront that we'll give 2018 guidance with our Q4 earnings call, so not going to go into any specific detail and targets at this time.  I know 2018 is on many investors' minds, but it's important for us to complete our planning process in order to provide you with a high-quality discussion on 2018 that we all expect. I'll hit the key areas that are most important to investors in order to keep the discussion focused, so if we don't hit something here, we'll cover it in the Q&A session.  The first point I'll make is probably the most important. We are on track to deliver against the revenue, adjusted EPS, free cash flow and capital allocation guidance that we set out at the beginning of the year. We're using all the tools in our business operating system to get there and given evolving market dynamics, it is a bit different than what we envisioned when we gave guidance back in January. I'm proud of the way our team has pulled together in some challenging market conditions to achieve these goals, which should yield strong revenue growth of about 4.5%, 9% EPS growth and free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion. In 2017, orders and revenues had been consistently strong, our end markets on balance have been solid and the outlook for the markets continues to be healthy, looking into 2018. Our HVAC businesses are performing well and will have a strong order and margin expansion in 2017. Our Transport business is demonstrating the resiliency we expect with a modest decline in revenues and margins despite challenging markets. Our Industrial business is recovering nicely with order growth and margin expansion ahead of our expectations. There are a lot of things working well for us. One area that we're not satisfied with and we expect to improve on in 2018, is our operating leverage. Our business model is rooted in our ability to drive margin expansion in low growth environments and we did not make enough progress expanding incremental margins for the enterprise in 2017. We were negatively impacted by a few key factors in 2017 including higher-than-expected and persistent inflation, mix of business as we penetrated underserved Commercial HVAC markets, most notably in China, which at present carry lower gross margins in our portfolio average, but still are accretive to our EPS. This business is particularly accretive when you add in the highly profitable service tails from applied equipment sales in the mid- to long-term.  The way our bridges on price versus cost are compiled, the impact in moving into these newer markets shows up as price although some would probably categorize this as business mix. Rather than confuse anybody, we've kept the designation in price consistent for all of 2017, but I believe it is worth noting this distinction as it has a pronounced impact in how our price versus cost spread shows up in the bridge. We're seeing better than expected success in these markets from China with approximately 20% order growth year-to-date and low 30s order growth in the third quarter. This is putting increased pressure on climate and enterprise margins as China is experiencing the impacts of both negative price and inflation, whereas the majority of our businesses are seeing positive price.  We're in the process of developing our 2018 operating plan, and we're focused on accelerating productivity initiatives to drive higher leverage in 2018 and beyond. Increased focus here will drive more direct control of our margin expansion irrespective of market conditions. We're also seeing inflation moderating in 2018 as we begin to lap the inflation we saw throughout 2017, so we should see reduced headwinds here. Similarly on the China market penetration strategy, we begin to lap the lower gross margins for those markets in 2018, so we anticipate the pressure on leverage in the region moderating as well.  Moving through the update. Year-to-date, our end markets continue to perform well with strong broad-based orders in revenue growth. Our outlook is for our end markets to remain healthy through at least 2018. Execution across the business continues to be solid. The tragic, unprecedented natural disasters in the third quarter took a toll on our 750 associates in Puerto Rico, our customers and more broadly, on our markets. Our thoughts are with our employees, their families and of all the lives that were impacted by these terrible tragedies.  Financially, these natural disasters had an impact on us in the third quarter. We estimate that the impact was between $0.04 to $0.05 of EPS when you take into account downtime in our Thermo King, Puerto Rico manufacturing facility, the disaster release funds we provided to assist our employees and the 3 days of lost sales and productivity and 2 of our largest HVAC markets in Florida and Houston. Slide 6 lays out the main impacted areas, and Sue will cover these in more detail in a few minutes. We think we'll see some recovery in the fourth quarter and in 2018, and there likely will be additional market opportunities over the next 1 to 3 years as building occurs in the affected geographies. So laid out earlier, the impact of our strategy to compete in new markets in Asia and the Middle East is driving exceptional growth for us in these markets, but the impact to leverage and the price versus cost equation was significant in the quarter. Again, we see these areas improving as we move into 2018, as we lap 2017 inflation and gross margin headwinds. We're also driving aggressive productivity plans for 2018 to expand margins. The next topic is on price versus cost, as we see it at this stage in the year. Things are shaping up fairly consistent with what we expected coming out of the second quarter earnings call. Pricing remains positive in both Climate and Industrial. The areas that are impacting our price versus cost equation across both Climate and at the enterprise-level, are predominantly emanating from Asia and to a lesser extent, the Middle East as we previously outlined.  With regard to our Industrial segment, this segment has been performing well in 2017 and ahead of our expectations. We've seen strong bookings growth and margin expansion in the segment. And the last topic, is an update on our Climate businesses broadly. Commercial HVAC equipment businesses remain strong with high single digit order growth in Q3. Our Commercial pipeline and outlook continue to show healthy markets going forward. Our Residential and Transport outlooks are also on track with our expectations. Focused execution of our strategy will deliver strong performance over time, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in 2018 and beyond. I hope that this has given you some important insights on how our outlook has evolved through this point in the year. And now I'll turn it over to Sue to discuss the third quarter in more detail. Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #5. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we drove solid operating and financial results in the third quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.44 despite business disruptions from natural disasters in the quarter negatively impacting results by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per share.  Our adjusted tax rate was 17.7% driven by the timing of a number of tax planning-related discrete items that hit in the third quarter that were expected in the second half of 2017. We continue to expect our full year 2017 adjusted tax rate to be approximately 21% or the lower end of our previous range. Bookings growth was strong with growth in both segments and in every strategic business unit. On the Climate side, organic bookings were up mid-single digits in both Commercial HVAC and Transport, and up low single digits in Residential with another quarter of share gains. We also drove high-teens Commercial organic bookings growth in Asia and Europe, Middle East and Africa. Climate organic revenues were also higher, up 3% in the quarter.  Our Industrial segment continues on a path of steady improvement and is actually performing a bit better than our guidance with strong organic bookings growth of 5% overall. Compression Technologies had growth across small and medium compressors and particular strength in large compressors. We also drove a 90-basis-point improvement in adjusted operating margins on essentially flat revenues. Flat revenues were also better than our expectations given difficult compares versus Q3 of 2016 as we discussed on our second quarter call.  In January, we laid out our capital allocation priorities for 2017, including spending approximately $430 million on dividends and an additional $1.5 billion on a combination of share buybacks, and acquisitions and we're on track to achieve those priorities. We also discussed our objective to grow our dividend at or above the rate of our earnings growth. In August, we raised our dividend by 12.5% to an annualized rate of $1.80 per share. Year-to-date through October, we've spent $1 billion on share buybacks and $318 million in dividends. We also spent or entered into commitments for approximately $200 million in acquisitions.  Please go to Slide 6. During the third quarter, we saw positive and negative financial impacts from natural disasters, primarily the hurricanes that hit the Caribbean, Florida and Texas. We saw increased commercial rental activity and increased part sales in the third quarter. Offsetting the positive financial impacts, shipments for Transport in our Puerto Rico facility, residential and small electric vehicles were also delayed and our businesses were down for several days resulting in lower absorption, productivity and other additional costs. We expect to regain some of the deferred business in the fourth quarter and we are currently assessing the potential impacts for 2018. If the recovery from these storms follows past experience, we'd expect to see an overall strengthening in the underlying markets in the impacted areas over time rather than a spike of activity in any given month.  Please go to Slide #7. The focused execution of our business strategy underpinned by our business operating system enabled us to drive solid year-over-year financial performance. Organic revenues and adjusted earnings per share increased 2%. Adjusted operating margins declined 40 basis points year-over-year, impacted by the $0.04 to $0.05 earnings per share headwinds from natural disasters. As Mike discussed earlier, our strategy of penetrating very large underserved markets in China in Commercial HVAC is resulting in strong bookings growth with China Commercial HVAC up low 20s percent year-to-date and up low 30s percent in Q3. In the short term, the negative impact of this growth is approximately 55 basis points of margin contraction at the enterprise-level in Q3 although still accretive to our earnings per share year-to-date and it is expected to represent 75% of the negative price-cost spread for the full year 2017.  Please go to Slide #8. As we've discussed, organic orders were strong in the third quarter with increased activity in both our Climate and Industrial businesses. Organic Commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single digits. Q3 2017 North America bookings were up low single digits. Outside of North America Commercial HVAC, bookings were broad based with high-teens growth in EMEA and Asia, and mid-teens growth in Latin America. Transport organic bookings were up mid-single digits with gains in North America, Latin America and Asia. Bookings growth span the product portfolio with gains in trailer, truck, bus, aftermarket, APU and Marine. Industrial organic bookings were up 5% in the quarter with growth across all Industrial businesses. Regionally, North America and Asia bookings gains were offset by declines in Latin America and Europe, Middle East and Africa.  Please go to Slide #9. In our Climate segment, organic revenue was up low single digits in North America, up mid-single digits in Europe and up low teens in Asia. Globally, equipment was up low single digits and aftermarket was up mid-single digits. In our Industrial segment, organic revenue was down 1%. We had large compressors shipments in Q3 of 2016 that did not repeat this year. Regionally, we saw a low single-digit growth in North America and Latin America. In our Compression Technology business, North America was up low single digits in parts and services. Industrial Products were up mid-single digits and Club Car had high single-digit growth with continued success in Onward personal vehicles. Overall, North America and international revenues were up low single digits, netting a 2% organic growth rate for the enterprise.  Please go to Slide #10. Q3 adjusted operating margin declined 40 basis points, primarily driven by volume, productivity improvement and positive price, more than offset by natural disasters as previously discussed, and material inflation including the negative impact of price versus costs largely driven by our penetration of underserved markets in China and competitive pricing in the Middle East. The impact of China and the Middle East were greater than we anticipated earlier in the year driven by higher volumes and forecast, and higher-than-expected material inflation, which widened the negative price-cost spread. Outside of these markets, the price versus cost spread was largely in line with our expectations.  Please go to Slide 11. We covered the main points from this slide on prior slides. Performance in the quarter was strong on bookings and revenues. Excluding the natural disaster impacts in Climate, margins would have been roughly flat. Margin declines largely attributable to our China strategy and the negative price versus cost spread in the Middle East, which combined, were approximately negative 65 basis points.  Please go to Slide 12. We've also covered the highlights of this slide on prior slides. Our Industrial business continues to outperform our expectations and deliver strong improvement in bookings and margins on relatively flat revenues. Our continued focus on improving the fundamental operations of the business is yielding good results. Please go to Slide 13. Free cash flow was $408 million for the third quarter driven largely by strong profits. Working capital as a percentage of revenue remains on track to our expectations for 2017. Our guidance for free cash flow remains unchanged at $1.2 billion. Additionally, our balance sheet continues to strengthen, which provides optionality as our markets continue to evolve. Please go to Slide 14. Continued strong cash flows in 2017 is powering our dynamic capital allocation strategy, employing capital where it earns the best returns. In January, we laid out our 2017 capital allocation priorities and they remain unchanged. Our first priority is making high ROI investments in our business to drive productivity and to maintain our product leadership position. The secondary is maintaining a strong balance sheet with BBB ratings and healthy optionalities as our markets evolve. The third area is our commitment to paying a highly competitive, reliable dividend that grows at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. The fourth priority is strategic acquisitions and share repurchases.  In January of this year, we committed to spend $1.5 billion between these 2 areas and we're on track to achieve these commitments. Year-to-date, we spent approximately $1 billion on share repurchases and approximately $200 million has been spent or committed to acquisitions. By the end of 2017, we expect to have approximately $400 million to $500 million spent or committed for acquisitions. As we look forward to 2018 and beyond, our overarching strategy and priorities remain the same.  Please go to Slide 15. For 2017, we're maintaining our revenue, earnings per share and cash flow guidance. For modeling purposes, we also wanted to provide tax rate guidance, which should come in at the lower end of our previous range or approximately 21%. For the full year, we expect fully diluted shares to approximate 258 million based on share repurchases in 2017. Please go to Slide 17. We've received positive feedback on the section covering key topics we know are of interest to you in our prepared remarks. So we'll cover a few of these topics on the next couple of slides. The first topic is HVAC order growth in the third quarter. Our HVAC markets remain very healthy. In the third quarter, orders were higher in all of our major geographic regions. We had especially strong order growth in overseas markets up by high teens. North America Commercial HVAC continue to see good order growth against difficult comparisons with 2016.  Residential HVAC orders also improved compared with record activity last year and the business continues its steady market share improvement.  Please go to Slide 18. The last topic for today is the acquisition pipeline. As previously discussed, we're expecting to close on or have signed agreements on approximately $400 million to $500 million in acquisitions in 2017. We are focused on channel and technology investments that add to our existing core businesses. Most recently, we entered into an agreement to acquire a telematics company. This acquisition will complement our 2015 acquisition of Celtrak and allow us to expand our expertise in telematics, in addition to the many services it already provides for our small electric vehicles business today. Now I'd like to turn it over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thank you, Sue. So on closing on Slide 19. We expect to deliver our 2017 plan for revenue growth, adjusted EPS, free cash flow, utilizing our business operating system and building a thriving, more valuable Ingersoll Rand.  To summarize, our Climate segment remains strong, led by our Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses, which are focused on growth areas with equipment, controls and service. Our Transport Refrigeration business is diverse and agile, and is executing their strategy and delivering against our high expectations in a challenging market. Our Industrial business is improving ahead of our expectations for growth and margin expansion.  75% of our negative price versus cost spread in 2017 is expected to come from very strong growth in Asia, primarily China. We expect both the inflation and pricing headwinds to moderate heading into 2018. The balance of our markets should see moderating inflation in 2018 as well as they lap 2017 inflation. Nonetheless, we're accelerating our 2018 productivity initiatives to drive more direct control over margin expansion irrespective of market conditions.  We're also on track to achieve the capital allocation priorities we laid out at the beginning of 2017. We expect to deploy roughly $1.9 billion in cash in the form of dividends, buyback and acquisitions. We have a tremendous depth of talented people and our culture remains as strong as ever. And taken together, I'm confident that with this formula, we'll continue to deliver top-tier financial and operating performance. So with that, Sue and I will now be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, you gave a lot of color on your price versus costs issues, and you talked about how most of the issues were emanating from China and the Middle East. I know you don't want to give detail on 2018, but as you tend to shift  the overall company, it's a little more of these longer cycle Applied HVAC orders, especially in international markets, how difficult do you think it'll be to get your arms around price versus cost? And what could you do specific on these regions where competition is significant and inflation is still reasonably high? Michael Lamach : Yes, Andy, I think maybe it's best for us to start with what is our China strategy historically and how we're evolving, and I think that will answer a lot of questions for you. First of all, China as a country and Asia as a region would have some of the highest operating margin that we have across the HVAC space, still today even this quarter. Historically, we've been a Tier 1 and Tier 2 city-focused company and largely on applied equipment and we've been very successful there. We've penetrated those markets with very high share and often Trane is the basis of design in many of these projects. What we've done over the last 2 years and you're seeing it this year in spades, is we've extended to Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities. We've also launched both localized, ducted and ductless unitary product nationally. We've penetrated, and are penetrating larger infrastructure project things, subways and airports and the electronics vertical specifically, which is Applied. And those 3 things in Tier 3, Tier 4 cities help drive Trane as a basis of design in those cities as well. It's been a formula we followed for years and it's been very successful for us. We know that, that grows a large service tail and we know that we grow margins by leveraging the SG&A and the manufacturing base around that. So to put it in context, the strategy has been very successful. We put a PGT in place about 2 years ago. We fully localized product portfolio in unitary, duct to ductless, we've been there and Applied for some time. We added 178 selling and marketing people onto the street over the last 12 months and 165 of those, we put in just since January so the project pipeline we're seeing in China is up 211%. So to speak for clarity, it's 3x larger than what it would have been last year at the same time around that pipeline. So year-to-date, we've seen bookings growth in unitary, it's actually been 40-plus percent. We've had mid-20s revenue growth in unitary. Unitary is now 25% of the mix that we have in equipment in China. We've also been able to grow the Applied business at twice the market rate year-to-date, and we're seeing excellent service growth. So again, it's become so successful that it really is, we classify it as price, but we're growing this accretively to the company and long term it's the right and most successful strategy that we know how to conduct. By the way, we would have a similar strategy, there are nuances to what we'll be doing in Europe or Latin America, but every region of the world, it's got a unique strategy, and in China, it's just been very successful for us. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, that's helpful color. And then just shifting gears to North American Commercial HVAC bookings, they were up low single digits against tough comp as you talk about it. I think it's good result compared to last quarter, but can you give us a little more color regarding what you're seeing in the overall North American HVAC market? There's been slowing like unitary. You talked about Applied HVAC improving there, do you still see a good runway in Applied HVAC, so North American Commercial HVAC bookings should be up low single digits or better moving forward? Michael Lamach : Yes, I would say first as a starting point, nothing has changed that would make us less bullish on the end markets than we were 5 years ago when we talked to everybody at Analyst Day. Our outlook continues to be very positive. We'll see contingent... Andrew Kaplowitz : 5 months ago. Michael Lamach : 5 months ago, thanks. Low single digit to mid-single digit growth in North America Commercial, and that we're going to drive share gains. Our project pipeline is actually stronger today than it was last year at the same time. We also think inflation in 2018 is fairly consistent with what we expected 5 months ago. We think it's going to be much more copper-related, which is much easier for us to set pricing and cost into the factories, about how to price and cover that as supposed to steel, which is very difficult than the longer lead items, so we think that, that will be more manageable for us. So staying with where we were 5 months ago, the CAGR of 4% to 4.5% over the 3-year period, 11% to 13% EPS growth over that period, still very much in the cards for us. We're very confident about that. We'll update that in the fourth quarter, but a lot of that's underpinned that we're seeing strength not only in North America, but across the globe and you're seeing that in even Latin America. As we pointed out, mid-teens growth rate in Latin America, finally seeing some recovery there and don't forget, that's an important market for us too. It's a $0.5 billion in revenue in the Climate space for us. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Nigel Coe : Mike, so I just wanted to go back and visit the price cost. So the 55 bps impact from Asia and Middle East you called out, so just given your comments on China, is that more accurately a mix impact as opposed to price cost impact? Michael Lamach : Yes, Nigel. It's a very specific definition we use and we say that if it's equipment coming out of a factory using the same machining and assembly processes, that we mark that as price. But clearly, what you're seeing in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities, is even more decontented product and you're seeing that generally, those have done some of the local players that have been in that market. So it is mix more than it is price. But again, for consistency of what we've been talking about, we classify on the bridge as price just to keep it sort of straight for everybody at this point in time. But it is something that if you move past China, you look at say Res for example. On the Residential in North American business, we grew margins considerably, we grew share considerably. We're managing that. If you go to the balance of the Commercial businesses, excluding the Middle East and Asia, we're largely covering inflation there and of course, in the Industrial side, we're covering inflation there completely. So it's really isolated to this penetration we're seeing in China. Middle East is a bit different. Here you've got just this fact that you've got the same number of competitors fighting over fewer projects there, and so you're going to have a bit more competition there as well. In 2018, I think that we're clear that we've got moderating steel environment. We've got our copper environment that we can lock a good portion of it, understand at the beginning of the year. We feel like, generally speaking, it's a more manageable year in terms of the global material inflation, pricing scenario. And specific to Asia, it's really a matter of just getting to scale on some of these Tier 3, Tier 4 cities, getting additional service density in these cities and we know how to grow margins from there. So again, it's a long-term view towards China. I think we see an improvement in 2018 in China leverage. Nigel Coe : Right. Okay. But if you have to think about maybe just moving away from China because obviously that's -- it's kind of a good problem to have if you grow into that kind of rate. But if you think about North America, Europe, if you think about the pendulum of competition and pricing, is it becoming more competitive? Less competitive? About balanced? I mean, how do you say that pendulum is shifting? Michael Lamach : Yes, there's nothing structurally different about the competition in these markets. We've had high-teens growth before in Europe. We've had substantial growth in Europe over the last few years. It's really about new product introduction, around next-generation refrigerants, building out a controls portfolio, a wireless portfolio, double-digit growth there, more digital involvement in connecting our businesses remotely, more service feet on the street. So it's always been a competitive environment, but you're able to differentiate that business on total cost of ownership, which is 90% of that equation is not the initial cost, it's the energy efficiency and the maintenance and the reliability of the product over the long haul and nothing's has changed about our value proposition there at all. Susan Carter : And Nigel, it's Sue. Let me add a little bit of color on the pricing to that, I think, is important and it really doesn't come out in all of the detail that we've got. So we talked about that price is actually positive in both of the segments, which it is. The other piece of it is that the pricing that we have achieved in the year is actually higher than last year. Again, we know the inflationary pressures that we've got, but we have really been able to build positive pricing in the areas of the world, and like I said, in total, it is positive in a dollar terms on a year-over-year basis and it's fairly significant. And it does have the headwind in there on price from Asia. So I don't want anyone to think that the pricing is actually not strong and that we haven't in pricing in 2017, we actually have and it's actually stronger than it was in 2016. Nigel Coe : That's an important point. And just to follow on SG&A. You talked about G&A as an important area of productivity improvement. And Mike, in the PR, you talked about ramping up productivity to offset some of these price material pressures. If we delineate between the S and the G&A in that 5% inflation, are we starting to see the G&A good news coming through but it's being masked by some of these sales investments, so is that on the come? Michael Lamach : Yes. Relative to 2018, Nigel, I will tell you that we're going to generate $300 million plus in productivity like we do every year. It's going to be direct material. It's going to be PGT led with engineering product management and operations. It'll be both direct and indirect in that regard. I think what's going to be different for us is we spent a couple of quarters in excruciating detail, understanding the G&A and sort of benchmarks and ideas around reducing G&A across the company, which will show up strict on the G&A line over time between '18 -- 2018 and 2020 over a multiyear period, certainly starting in 2018 will have an impact. We also see opportunities with a lot of what we've done around automation and lean around things like warehouse consolidations and logistics opportunities that we are able to take advantage of. And again, we'll start to see those in 2018 as well. So what I'm saying is, in addition to the normal high levels of productivity that we expect in the operating system, there are a couple of projects that literally we're having to build program offices and [ secund ] very talented people into the program office to be able to drive what's likely to be hundreds of projects that roll up into these 2 bigger ideas, but I think that we got more leverage in '18, '19 and '20, from those things and I'm pretty excited about it. We talked about it at your conference in fact, and I'm glad you asked me the question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : On the Commercial side, last quarter, you had mentioned the unitary markets on that slide as growing. What are you seeing in those markets and ahead of this kind of regulatory transition in 2018? Do you expect any kind of pre-buy? And then just what's your outlook for kind of the core unitary markets going forward? Michael Lamach : Yes, [indiscernible] growth again in North America, in the quarter, nice growth in the quarter there. So I don't anticipate a pre-buy there, Steve, per se. There could be some. I mean, it'd be great, if there was, but I don't -- we don't anticipate much of one at this point in time. But we are going to be sure that we build inventory and we're talking to customers about what is stackable and if in fact, they want to take that on. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay, great. And then in Residential, you guys also mentioned for the first time, channel, at least relative to last quarter. What do you -- I've heard from the Chunnel that you guys are kind of building out a bit of these --  the storefronts like Lennox has. I don't know if that's kind of an ongoing strategy that you've been just doing under the radar that you haven't talked about a lot. Maybe you can just give us some clarity on what exactly you're doing in the channel outside of the digital stuff that you've already mentioned and maybe different relative to last year, the year before that? Michael Lamach : Yes. Thanks, Steve. We've got about 260 part stores today. Generally speaking, we've got them where we want them. We were adding up 3 last year, but we've got the coverage we generally need, and we're finding opportunities to transition some of that digitally so it doesn't all have to be brick-and-mortar, but there's 260 brick-and-mortar stores that are out there. What you're finding on unitary, both res and commercial though, is there is this past year in particular, much more of a bias with customers replacing than repairing. So I do think that that's put a little bit of pressure on mix, but for the right reasons. You're really seeing people at this point in time doing wholesale replacements. Susan Carter : And Steve, I would also point out that in the context of our part stores, the 260 that Mike mentioned, that serves both Commercial and the Residential markets for us. And in fact, Commercial is a little heavier than Residential in terms of overall sales for those part stores. Michael Lamach : And as you know, Steve, a lot of contractors don't identify themselves as one or the other. Susan Carter : Right. Michael Lamach : So it makes sense that we just have one presence to our customers. C. Stephen Tusa : That makes sense. And how fast -- just one last question, how fast did those grow like over the last couple of years, what was the -- how many, I guess, did you add in 2016, just as a reference point? Michael Lamach : Yes, a dozen maybe. And we -- Steve, we've been working at that for a long time. It's not -- it just hasn't been something that you'd pull out of our company as being the large mover and shaker around the business, but they're an important part of the business and we've got the 260, the coverage we think we need. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Kwas : Mike, wanted just to get your thoughts on as we -- big picture as we think about mix within Climate for next year? You've had very strong growth on the order side in China. You've talked about the price, the mix headwinds there, that brings lower growth than the developed markets. How does that shape up as we think about a normal incremental margin for Climate particularly in comparison to this year? Do we get -- do you think you can get back into that 25%, 30% range on a year-over-year basis with some of the initiatives you have in place and given the mix changing? Michael Lamach : Yes, I've no doubt, Rich, that the planning we'll do for 2018 will have us coming back to more normalized leverage in that business, and we've built a portfolio that should be agnostic to the product specifically. I mean, as you know, Applied's got a little lower margin, but great service base over a long period of time. And unitary gives you a little bit of a margin pop sooner, but there's enough happening in the world and enough growth in the world that I expect, again, good growth in 2018. The pipeline supports that. We think we've got a more manageable mix of inflation moving from steel to copper, easier to get on top of that from a pricing perspective. So -- and then your question related to what Nigel asked, if we can do a bit more around some of the rooftop consolidation, a bit more around the G&A leverage in the company, no doubt that will get back to where we've historically been. Richard Kwas : Okay. And then just on -- as we think about institutional, given you seem some -- to have some macro-wise, some moving numbers here with regard to forward indicator given Dodge and ABI, et cetera, but generally moving in the right direction, I know you emphasized no change versus 5 months ago earlier in the call, but just within the mix of the business, how do you think about that shaping up for this year in terms of higher growth rate, potentially for '18 versus '17 and impact on margin? I think you touched on Applied being lower margin, but is that meaningful enough to impact overall incrementals and how much -- what's the offset on the top line with regards to... Michael Lamach : Yes. So one of the issues, it's tough I know from an analyst and investor's perspective, is to take that Dodge or ABI data and all you can do is take it at face value, but I've always said that, that Dodge data would really account for about 50% of what we consider to be the market, the visible market would be what Dodge is reporting, but 50% of it, frankly, it's the good 50%, is the negotiated piece of that, the negotiated retrofit of the performance contracting side of that, and that's where we've got the added benefit of looking at a pipeline, and those pipelines are well done. It's a process that we've been running in the company for a long time. It's a high level of confidence about what gets reported in there and how we assign close rates and probability to those projects. And so when I look at what I see for 2018, I see a good runway and good projects. There's a number of very large projects that have the possibility of going in 2018 for us that we generally wouldn't put into a forecast, we generally wouldn't even put into our guidance, but similar to what happened in 2016 or at historic '17 a little bit for us, we're going to have a little bit of it in 2018 as well. These projects would range from $50 million to $200 million apiece and so they're going to move the numbers a great deal if, in fact, they hit. But excluding those, we see a strong pipeline, including those, is a very strong pipeline. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just switching to the Industrial segment for a change. So Compression Tech, you've had pretty good equipment orders growth in the last say, 3 quarters. The sales though have been down substantially in equipment year-to-date. So I just wondered within Compression Tech, how we think about the conversion of that order number into equipment revenues and when we should start to see the equipment revenue line accelerate? Michael Lamach : One really good data point for us that I'll tell you on this call, is that you know we're very indexed toward very large compressors. We're #1 in centrifugal compression technology in that space and of course, you know that, that carries 40% to 50% pull through on service along with that over time. And that has grown in the mid-20s, bookings growth during the year, and it grew in the mid-20s again in the third quarter. So we're feeling good about what that means for 2018 shipments and even beginning to formulate early 2019 shipments around some of the larger compressors. So that's an exciting change for us as it relates to backlog being built in large compressors and it's exciting as it relates to the kind of leverage we expect to see from that. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And then just circling back on the productivity and other inflation line in your margin bridge. Historically in years, when that have been good, it was about 100 basis point tailwinds, 2012 or 2014, 2015. When you're talking about more aggressive measures on productivity for next year, is that the type of tailwind you think that we should expect, about 100 bps from that line? Michael Lamach : Julian, without setting guides, being careful here. That's sort of the general theme about how we think about setting plans would be to have about 100 bps of positive spread there. And then I take you back to my boxer analogy, that works great sitting in November and December and then as you get in the ring in January and you take a punch to figure out how to use all the tools at your disposal to win the fight. So that would be our sort of going in idea, and then what we want to make sure we're doing is we're putting some additional levers in place around ideas like rooftop consolidation and G&A that would be additive to that or in the event that inflation or pricing wouldn't behave the way we expect it to, we've got some additional countermeasures in place. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff  Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Mike, I want to come back just a little bit again to China, and just the maturation of this Tier 3 and Tier 4 strategy, just a couple of points I'm interested in. Where are you on product development for those companies -- for those cities? I'm sorry. You mentioned decontenting product to serve those markets. Do you have a product refresh or product redesign that needs to be -- needs to happen to kind of effectively address this? And also I'm just wondering, you talked about the opportunity for service capture, what kind of service capture are you actually seeing in those markets? Michael Lamach : Yes. And to be clear, Jeff, we've got all of the product now in the marketplace, both ducted -- ductless and applied and controls in the marketplace, so we're fully functional there. What will happen is, you'll get certain feature sets that are often specified by others into Tier 3, Tier 4 cities. You go out and you try to explain the value and the total cost of ownership around time and over time, we're pretty successful with that. But initially, you tend to find feature sets that carry lower margins than perhaps something you'd find in Beijing or Shanghai, typically. In fact, the product development going on now around the unitary space is to take the unitary product that we have and actually go the other way with that, which is higher efficiency unitary coming back into Tier 1, Tier 2 cities around that. And again, this is all in the Commercial space, not on the Residential space at all. So it's a very thoughtful strategy over time about putting manufacturing, product management, operations in place, product road teams, feet on the street, incrementally quite a few as a result of all this. And then excellent execution on the ground by the team there. To the point where you just don't forecast 40-plus-percent growth rates as you're doing your plans. You set goals and objectives around those sorts of things, but you don't sort of plan those things. What the team has generated sort of -- they've been on top of even those stretch goals, which to me is really solid execution. In the long run, it's building out a strong base. And -- it's not changed that half of the world's chillers, the last 5 years have gone in China, half the world's chillers are going to go into China in the next 5 years, and it makes sense like it does everywhere for us to have a full unitary, applied, controls, service and digital footprint and for that to be direct on the Commercial side, and that's what we're doing. Jeffrey Sprague : And on the service capture side of things? How's that playing out? Michael Lamach : Yes, when I look back to 2008 and 2009, it would have been in that 10% range, compare that to North America or Western Europe, 50%. Today, it's in that 20%, 25% range and it will continue to move up in over the next say 5 to 10 years, look like Western Europe and North America, no doubt about that. The equipment gets more sophisticated. Customer's expectations around energy efficiency -- around sustainability goals in China, much more stringent than they have been in the past. All those things really lead more toward the OEM having an advantage in maintaining the equipment. Jeffrey Sprague : How much actual physical capacity are you needing to add to accomplish this? I mean there's certainly concerns that there's just excess manufacturing capacity in this space. Clearly, you're winning orders and growing your business and therefore, may need some, but how do you balance that risk reward? Michael Lamach : We don't have a need to build additional factories in Asia. We've got a substantial footprint today and we continue to lean it out. So lines are running faster in less space. And the more scale we get, the faster we can run the lines and hypothetically, the less space per dollar of margin we're going to need. So I don't have in the plans us needing to build a factory in China at any point in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So maybe going back to price for a second. We heard from Watsco this morning that some of its vendors were starting to advertise pricing increases in the fourth quarter. Are you guys trying to pull forward price in 4Q or should we think about that as being more like typical, like 1Q type event? Susan Carter : No. I mean, Joe, I think we follow our normal cadence, some of which might be in the fourth quarter, some in the first quarter, but there's no discussion that we're having about pulling any of that forward on a different schedule than normal. Michael Lamach : And Joe, just to confirm, price in res is exceeding material inflation and we grew margins again in the quarter. The hurricane impact to us was not in the res space. The res space, we were able to move inventory into the market. We're well positioned there. The impact for us was really losing 3 weeks of time in Puerto Rico at the manufacturing facility and there, just to skip to it, it wasn't the factory itself. We had the factory up and running with around temporary power with plenty of diesel, plenty of water, it was the fact that it was so difficult for our employees in the market that many of them lost their homes, lost everything, were just unable to come to work or didn't have the means to come to work to be able to build products. We're back up. We've been back up for a couple of weeks. We're running at rate. We haven't missed a beat in terms of customers there. We plan to head to build for hurricanes in advance and so we had stock there, just waiting for the ports to open up a little bit to ship them back out, but just to skip to that, it really wasn't in the res business for us, it was largely in the Thermo King business. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful color, Mike. Maybe my follow up here, and this is just perhaps refreshing my memory, but I thought you guys were targeting investments in the second half of the year that were roughly 2x that of the first half? So we were thinking it was going to be closer to like call it $40 million of spend in the second half. I think you did about $11 million this quarter? So should we think about the fourth quarter as being pretty highly loaded with an uptick in investments? Or are you pulling back on spend a little bit? Susan Carter : Well, Joe, so that's an interesting area. We are pulling back a little bit, but let me tell you how that's actually coming about because this is not, Mike and I going out and saying, we need to cut investments. So I would expect the fourth quarter to be a little higher than the third quarter, but nowhere near what the math would tell you that you would pull in, it's not 30, by any stretch. But our businesses, as we get closer to actually going through the projects that are in investments, and again, our investments are mostly new product development, channel and some IT type of investments, are actually looking at the projects and the return on those projects and they're coming to the conclusion that the returns are not at the expectations that they have and we have as a company. And so they're the ones pulling them off the table and perhaps going back to do some additional work on those business cases and maybe they'll show up again in 2018, but it's really SBU-driven, pulling down those investments in the back half of the year and we're very supportive of that for those reasons. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Just a question on sort of management succession. You've had some recent changes at the top. I think some have been scheduled like Didier and Robert, but I think Gary Michel was probably not expected. Can you just tell us as to what this means about sort of operational direction of the company, this transition at the top? And what's happening with Gary's role? Michael Lamach : Yes. Thank you, Andy. It's a good probably, opportunity to step back and talk about all the changes, some of which you mentioned, some that they'll be able to catch-up on. Robert and Didier have been great partners to this company for a long time, both had plans for 2018 retirements. We began to put pen to paper in January '17, and we've got Robert who will step out in January of '18 and Didier in September of '18, so we're able to benefit from their involvement for some time yet. At that point, we began to plan and in early September, or the 5th of September, we actually appointed Dave Regnery as the EVP combining those 2 roles. And really what's happened here is we've had very strong, consistent leadership at the SPU level for now a long time. We're not at the same place we were 5 years ago and so the role has changed and I've got a lot of confidence in Dave and Dave's capability of 30 years with the company, and obviously, doing a great job with the HVAC business in North America and EMEA, lived in different parts of the world and managed about every part of the company at one point or another. At the same time, we put Dave in that role, we moved Donny Simmons into Dave's role. Now Donny, you all would have met at our Investor Day, Donny was leading fluid material, handling Power Tools. He led a large part of the Commercial North American and Trane organization before that. Before that, he was in finance, both the Climate segment and going all the way back to TK, so Donny stepped into that role. A couple of weeks later, Gary had announced his intent to retire from the company at the end of September. Concurrent with Gary's announcement, we appointed Jason Bingham. Jason is the President for HVAC and supply. He also spoke at the analyst conference. If you recall, Jason was running our Controls Contracting and Digital business. It's been built into $1 billion plus business for us over time and he's got a 26-year tenure with the company going back to 1991, strong commercial, strong residential background. So he's a fish in water, really in the res business. And then we had also the planned retirement of Marc Dufour. Marc runs our Club Car business. And Marc is going to retire in January of '18. So we announced Marc's retirement around the same time, [indiscernible] with us over that period of time. And Mark Wagner, who you would have all again met at [indiscernible]  Conference. Mark was one of the speakers there. He's running Club Car for us. So it's really leveraging very strong internal leadership talent, very good communication by the senior executives in the company around their succession plans and timing, the tremendous willingness for them to work with us around dates so that it could work for everybody and have good continuity. We're very excited about the changes that we've got and these guys have been in place now for a couple of months, a good month at this point, and it's pretty exciting. Andrew Obin : And just a follow-up question on cost, and I apologize I'm sort of beating the dead horse here. Just so we have slightly lower spend in the quarter following lower investment spend that we're planning on. I would imagine that China and Middle East strategy, you've had that for a while, so I'm just still sort of a little bit missing why there was this earnings shortfall? Is it because sort of China and Middle East ended up being more expensive than we expected? Or is there something else on top of that below the surface that was weaker than we expect? And I apologize if I missed it. Michael Lamach : Yes. I mean, if I put it really simply, I would say that the Tier 3, Tier 4 strategy for some of the larger infrastructure projects are carrying about 5 points lower gross margin, let's say than the Tier 1, Tier 2 city historical applied market. And the fact that we've grown that at a rate twice the rate of the other business just put margin mix pressure there. And then, again, adding 178 people into the mix, it takes a while for those people to ramp up, but again, 40-plus-percent growth rate serves the ramping up pretty quickly. Susan Carter : And the other element, Andrew, is that Asia, China specifically, has had material inflation that has escalated throughout the year. So when we talk about that being persistent, it is very persistent. In fact, if I looked at where biggest impact occurs, it's our Commercial HVAC in North America followed by Asia-Pacific, followed by Residential. So they've also had that headwind that was bigger than what we thought earlier in the year and that also contributes to that dynamic. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital Markets. James Picariello : This is James Picariello, actually. So just on M&A, you mentioned $200 million commitment year-to-date. It looks like only $60 million has actually been spent. So is it safe to assume that the telematics asset represents most of that difference? And then also, how do you bridge to this $400 million to $500 million range? What's the timing between and actual agreement and close of a deal? So just trying to get a sense there. Michael Lamach : Yes, James, I think we closed 4 transactions or will close 4 transactions by the end of the month. So I wouldn't assume it all to be in the telematics space, so that would have been the larger of the group, but a couple of hundred million is really laid out, and we'll have that closed by the end of the month. The balance of that is our best guess of stuff in flight, of which I would say between $50 million and $200 million, there's a number of things in flight there that the timing could be off slightly, it could be a quarter off here or there. But those are lining up nicely as well too, and it ranges between channel and technology being added to the core portfolio. James Picariello : Okay. And then just last one on Residential HVAC replacement opportunity. How has -- how have prior storms really pulled through that demand? And typically over what time frame? Just trying to get your early assessment of what the opportunity could be next year and maybe even beyond that? Michael Lamach : Yes, it's a -- Commercial is a little easier to predict than res. Commercial, you could predict a great rental boom and followed by an immediate service requirement and we poured people into those locations to be able to provide service from out of state. And then depending on the criticality of what it is that you're conditioning space for those things really quickly. Res, you get everything between the tip of the tail, which is people with insurance, maybe a bit more fluent who are able to step in very quickly with or without insurance and replace, you've got the body of the bell curve, which is focused waiting for insurance that can take some time, the process and it's probably at this point, a 2018 event they should think about that. And they've got sort of other part of the bell curve, people without insurance that may not be able to step in and buy that as well. So that will take 1 to 3 years before that happens. So generally over 1 or 2 years, you see growth as a result of this so the net of it is usually growth, but it usually takes 1 to 2 years for it to show up on the res side -- on that res side, that is; on the commercial side, it's quicker. Operator : I will now turn the call over to Mr. Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Great. Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As usual, we'll be around to take any questions that you may have today or over the coming days. And we look forward to see many of you on the road in the coming weeks and into 2018. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This call is also being website on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website.  Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.  The participants on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO.  With that, please go to Slide 4, and I'll turn it over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks, everyone for joining us today. As I've said a number of times, since we held our Analyst Day in May of 2017, I'm more bullish about how Ingersoll Rand is positioned to execute on our strategy to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years than I've been at any other time in my tenure as CEO.  Please go to Slide 4. I'd like to start this morning by reviewing the fundamental elements of our business strategy because in the midst of any busy earnings season -- a season to move directly to micro trends and quarterly pluses and minuses and lose sight of the larger fundamental picture and trends that really drive value for long-term shareholders. First, our underlying strategic objectives continue to be to deliver profitable growth through leadership positions and durable markets underpinned by global mega trends such as sustainability and the need to dramatically reduce energy demand and resource constraints in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. We focus on innovation, and delivering the most reliable energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products and services available, enabled by digital and other exponential technologies. We excel at delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food waste, preserving natural resources and generating productivity for our customers. We maintain a healthy level investment in our businesses to sustain leading brands, which are #1 or #2 in virtually every market in which we participate. It's important to highlight that we continue to invest to maintain the portfolio of superior breadth and depth in nearly every major product category in which we compete.  In 2017, we continued our product growth team efforts, launching approximately 70 new major products throughout the world. We continue to strengthen our digital capabilities, creating value with customers and achieving competitive advantage. We launched TracKing, Thermo King's new asset management system. Through remote connectivity, best-in-class mobile apps and data gathering, customers make their fleets more predictable and traceable without taking assets off the road. Removing perishable goods, this ultimately strengthens their control and creates efficiencies.  This month, we introduced the Club Car Tempo Connect, the first car available with standard digital technologies that enhance the experience for golfers and course owners. We also applied breakthrough digital technology such as Trane Go to strengthen our residential HVAC connection with consumers and help them make more informed purchase decisions. This has resulted in a 2017 increase of 30% in our lead [ enclosure ] rate with consumers. In 2017 alone, we doubled the size of our EcoWise portfolio of products significantly ahead of regulatory requirements. These are products that reduce the impact on the environment and meet regulatory requirements for the use of next-generation, low global warming potential refrigerants without compromising efficiency and operating performance.  This month, we introduced the latest addition to the EcoWise portfolio, the Trane Agility, a new water-cooled centrifugal chiller product line, ideal for retrofitting existing commercial buildings. In Compression Technologies, we continued to expand our products and service offerings. In 2018, we'll significantly expand our market coverage for contact-cooled compressors to meet growing customer demand. On the services side, we'll be adding remote connectivity to rotary and oil-free equipment service offerings across North America. Our pipeline of innovation that solves complex customer problems is as exciting as ever and we have no intention of slowing down.  Second, our business model is designed to excel at delivering strong top line incremental margins and free cash flow through our business operating system over the long term. Our business operating system underpins everything we do and enables us to consistently generate high levels of free cash flow, which fuels our dynamic capital allocation strategy. In 2017, our business operating system enabled us to deliver free cash flow of $1.3 billion, which was 118% of adjusted net income.  While the leverage in our Climate business was below our historical and long-term objectives, we overcame a number of headwinds during 2017, including persistent rising inflation and more pronounced success in penetrating underserved HVAC markets in China than we had anticipated. We expect our Climate segment to return to historical leverage levels in 2018 and beyond. 2017 capital allocation was dynamic and balanced with healthy investments in organic innovation and new acquisitions and partnerships in key strategic channels and technologies. We also continued to substantially increase the dividend during the year and we purchased over $1 billion of our outstanding shares.  And finally, over the years, we've built an experienced management team and a high-performance culture, which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver strong results consistently over the long term. I hope this provides further insight into why I've never been so excited about the next few years for Ingersoll Rand. We are extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns going forward.  Moving to Slide 5 and turning our attention back to 2017. We met or exceeded the commitments we made in January 2017 when we gave our full year 2017 guidance. We exceeded the top end of the range on the core financial metrics : revenue growth, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Importantly, we also delivered against our capital allocation commitments, deploying $1.9 billion between dividends, share buybacks and acquisitions. We met the lower end of our guidance range on adjusted operating margins.  As we move through the presentation, we'll spend time discussing our path to delivering improved operating margin leverage in 2018 as this is a key area of focus for us. And now I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter and our market outlook and guidance for 2018. Sue? Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #6. I'd like to begin with a summary of main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we drove solid operating and financial results in the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.02, an increase of 21% versus the year-ago period. We delivered high-quality earnings, which helped drive 2017 free cash flow to $1.3 billion or 118% of adjusted net income.  Organic bookings and revenue growth was strong in both our Climate and Industrial segments. In the Industrial segment, we delivered low teens bookings growth in all 3 industrial businesses. We also delivered the strongest organic revenue growth quarter of the past 3 years. Additionally, the business continues to make steady improvements in its overall operating performance. On the Climate side, organic bookings were up high single digits in commercial HVAC with low teens growth in North America and solid growth in all other regions, except for Latin America. Organic revenue growth was also strong, up 6% and was broad based across all of our Climate businesses.  Our Industrial business continues to strengthen its operational performance, ahead of our expectations, with 160 basis points of improvement in adjusted operating margins on 5% organic revenue growth. Organic revenues were up low single digits in compressor technology and low teens in Club Car and Industrial Products. Importantly, we also delivered balanced capital allocation results while meeting the commitments we laid out for investors in our guidance in January of 2017. We deployed $430 million on dividends and increased the dividend 12.5% during the year, consistent with our commitment to maintaining a strong and growing dividend over the long term. We deployed $1 billion on share buybacks as the shares continue to trade below our are calculated intrinsic value.  To date, we've also deployed or entered into commitments for approximately $460 million in strategic value accretive technology and channel acquisitions, 2 of which we announced in January of 2018. Please go to Slide #7. The focused execution of our business strategy underpinned by our business operating system enabled us to drive solid year-over-year financial performance. We delivered organic revenue growth of 6%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 20 basis points and an adjusted earnings per share increase of 21%. Strong gains in volume, productivity and positive price more than offset headwinds from material cost inflation.  Please go to Slide #8. Organic order growth was robust in the fourth quarter. In fact, it was the fastest organic order growth for the enterprise in over 3 years with broad-based growth in nearly all businesses. Commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits. Commercial HVAC bookings in North America were up low teens and EMEA grew high single digits while Asia grew low single digits. Our Transport business continue to demonstrate its diversity and resiliency, posting modest growth in EMEA, Latin America and Asia and strong growth in APUs, truck, air and in the aftermarket business. These gains nearly offset expected weakness in the North America trailer market, netting a low single-digit decline in total transport orders. Industrial bookings were strong, up 12%, with low teens growth in all 3 of the businesses. Regionally, North America, Latin America and Asia all posted strong gains modestly offset by softer markets in EMEA. Please go to Slide #9. In our Climate segment, organic revenue was up mid-single digits in North America, up high single digits in Europe and basically flat in Asia where low teens growth in China was offset by softness in other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In our Compression Technologies business, North America was up low teens in equipment and high single digits in parts and services. Industrial Products, which includes our tools, Fluid Management and Material Handling businesses and small electric vehicles were both up low teens. Overall, North America and international revenues were up mid-single digits, netting a 6% organic growth rate for the enterprise.  Please go to Slide #10. Q4 adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points, primarily driven by strong volume, productivity improvements and positive price, partially offset by material inflation, investments in products and services and lower-margin business mix from our continued success penetrating underserved markets in China HVAC. We discussed the impact of China business mix on our third quarter call, but we'll spend some time discussing our underserved market penetration strategy in our Topics of Interest section towards the end of our prepared remarks.  Please go to Slide 11. Our Climate segment delivered strong broad-based revenue growth across the business. Operating margins were impacted primarily by material inflation and our mix of business from underserved markets in China.  Please go to Slide 12. As previously noted, operating performance in our Industrial business continues to steadily improve across the board. In the fourth quarter, the segment delivered low teens organic bookings growth, 160 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 5% organic revenue growth. Our continued focus on improving the fundamental operations of the business is making industrial a stronger, more resilient business, which should allow us to lever up nicely as the industrial markets continue to gradually improve.  Please go to Slide 13. Strong execution of our strategy and our business operating system continues to deliver powerful free cash flow. We continue to grow earnings, manage working capital to the right levels including having inventory to meet growth and on-time customer delivery and investing capital expenditures to support our businesses. We delivered $1.3 billion of free cash flow in 2017, which enabled us to maintain our strong balance sheet and retain optionality as our markets continue to evolve. It also enabled us to execute against our balanced capital allocation priorities and commitments to drive long-term value for shareholders.  Please go to Slide 14. In 2017, we executed a balance capital allocation plan and delivered against the commitments we made out at the beginning of the year, employing capital where it earns the best returns. We maintained a healthy level of business investments in product technology and innovation to extend our market leadership and to help customers solve their most complex challenges. We made strategic investments in value accretive technology and channel acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns. We maintained a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve and retained a BBB credit rating. We executed against our long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend.  We also raised the dividend 12.5%, which is ahead of the rate of earnings growth. Additionally, we deployed approximately $1 billion on share repurchases as the shares continued to trade below their intrinsic value. As we look forward to 2018 and beyond, we want to be very clear about how we're thinking about capital allocation. We are committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the best return on investment opportunities. Our overarching strategy and priorities remain the same as I just outlined and that we executed in 2017. We have a strong balance sheet and good optionality and we don't anticipate a need to add cash to our balance sheet for the foreseeable future. We're excited about the future and the opportunities that are ahead to deploy excess capital to the best ROI investments whether that be investment in the business, raising the dividend, repurchasing shares or making value-accretive acquisitions.  Please go to Slide 15. Let me take a moment to discuss the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In December, we booked the impacts of U.S. tax reform through the P&L on a provisional basis. We booked a largely noncash benefit from revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new rate of 21% versus the prior 35% rate. We also booked a liability for repatriation tax of approximately $160 million, which is payable over the next 8 years. We also booked a few other tax-related entries in Q4 and all tax reform and other entries are in the non-GAAP tables presented with the press release.  We have had access to our cash through our tax [ efficient ] structure for many years. We've utilized our cash to invest in our businesses in energy-efficient and sustainable products and have returned cash to shareholders through our competitive and growing dividend and share repurchases. Our actual cash repatriation is expected to be between 10% and 20% of our year-end cash balance. We will continue to utilize our tax efficient structure in the future and our projected tax rates are expected to remain in the low 20s.  Please go to Slide #17. I'd like to begin our guidance conversation with some color around what we're expecting from our end markets. Overall, global economic activity was healthy in 2017 and the majority of economic indicators point to a continuation of this trend in 2018. With the positive economic backdrop and our strategic product portfolio focus on global mega trends such as energy efficiency and sustainability, we see positive momentum in the majority of our markets in 2018. The setup for North America commercial and residential HVAC markets looks positive, and we're expecting a mid-single digit growth in these core markets.  In North America, approximately half of our commercial business is services and parts where we had good growth throughout 2017 and where the nature of the business generally tends to provide a more stable and recurring annuity stream than put-in-place equipment, which would be associated with things like new building starts. We've also had strong demand for upgrades to connected buildings and for energy retrofits to capture the energy efficiency savings from new equipment, controls and diagnostics.  In the residential market, replacement units make up approximately 80% of the total market. And as you can see from our bookings and sales growth in the fourth quarter, this market remains healthy. We expect to see continuing growth in both replacement and new construction in 2018. Outside of North America, commercial HVAC markets are not expected to be quite as strong with EMEA and Asia expected to be flat to up slightly. We expect Latin America markets to be up low single digits.  Transport markets in the Americas are expected to be roughly flat compared to 2017. Low teens declines for North America trailers are expected to be offset by growth in trucks, auxiliary power units and aftermarket parts. Transport in Europe is expected to be up based on growth in truck and trailer sales and a bottoming of the marine container market. Asia Pacific Transport continues to show significant opportunity with the challenges of getting fresh food in and around densely populated cities. This business was up low teens last year and we expect continued momentum in 2018.  Global Industrial markets generally continue to improve gradually as economies stabilize and CapEx budgets expand. We remain cautiously optimistic about demand and expect global Industrial markets to continue to show modest, steady growth in 2018. We've had solid improvement in order growth in North America and Europe in our short-cycle industrial businesses. The markets in Asia modestly improved during the fourth quarter, and we expect continued modest improvement in 2018. The large long-cycle compressor market started to improve in 2017 due to stabilization in the energy and heavy industry markets. Large long-cycle bookings were up a high-teens percent in 2017 and ahead of our initial expectations, which is encouraging. These orders tend to have a cycle time of roughly 12 to 18 months. Golf, utility vehicles and consumer vehicles combined are generally expected to be flat to slightly up across the globe. Our consumer vehicle continues to grow at a nice clip and utility vehicles are also expected to have good growth in 2018. We expect the golf market to remain roughly flat. Netting this all out, we are forecasting mid-single-digit growth in commercial HVAC in total, mid-single-digit growth in residential HVAC and low single-digit growth from our diversified portfolio in Transport. We expect our Compression Technologies business and our Industrial Products business, including the Power Tools, Material Handling and Fluid Management businesses to be up mid-single digits overall. Small electric vehicles are expected to be up mid-single digits.  Please go to Slide 18. I'll spend a few minutes walking you through the details for our 2018 guidance. Given the backdrop discussed on the previous slide, we expect total reported revenues to be up 5% to 5.5% in 2018 with both segments positively contributing. The difference between our reported and organic revenue contemplates about 1 percentage point of positive foreign exchange and about 1 percentage point from 2017 acquisitions. For the enterprise, we expect to see solid leverage from higher volumes, improved price and continued high levels of material productivity and other productivity more than offsetting material inflation. At the midpoint of our guidance, we'd expect to see approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion for the enterprise.  Please go to Slide 19. We expect continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2018 to be in the range of $5 to $5.20, excluding about $0.20 of restructuring. We have modeled approximately $500 million in share repurchases into our guidance, which translates into approximately 250 million diluted shares for 2018. As I outlined earlier, we're committed to dynamic and balanced capital allocation that consistently deploys excess cash over time. Net the actual allocation of excess cash will depend on where we see the highest ROI opportunities over the coming quarters.  Our target for free cash flow is equal to or greater than 100% of net income. The tax rate is estimated to be between 21% and 22% after including anticipated impacts of the December 2017 U.S. tax legislation. This is consistent with our prior long-term structural tax rate so while there are puts and takes, the bottom line result is that we're not expecting a change for Ingersoll Rand.  For your modeling purposes, we also offer the following guidance : corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $250 million; capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million, up from approximately $220 million in 2017, primarily driven by factory consolidation and localization initiatives.  Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike to cover key investor topics of interest and to close with a summary of key points. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Sue. I'm going to spend the balance of our prepared remarks, discussing the topics of interest we've received from many of you ahead of the call and then do a quick wrap-up summary before we open the floor for questions. Thanks to all of you who provided feedback to help us improve our focus on the issues that matter most to you in this section. Please go to Slide 21. The first topic I'll cover is our China strategy. It's one of the topics that has garnered a lot of interest with investors so we want to spend some time providing more detail in the strategy and expected impact going forward. First, it's important to note that our strategy in China for Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities is a proven strategy we've been successfully implementing in Tier 1 markets in the Applied space since we first entered the market. Our strategy is to enter underserved geographic and vertical markets by using a direct sales force, selling the product the way we do in most mature markets on a total cost of ownership basis versus the way you would sell an undifferentiated commodity.  This takes a talented network of salespeople and other infrastructure investments to deploy, which we've been doing for the past 18 months. Once the customer has experience with our systems and sees the value in the total cost of ownership equation, we aim to become the basis for design whereby we are advantaged with system reliability, energy conservation and greenhouse gas emission reductions. We fundamentally transform the market landscape to compete on total value terms and are rewarded for our quality, technology and innovation and service support. Margins improve as they would in any market where a product or service is differentiated and has a unique value proposition customers are willing to pay for. With Applied equipment, comes the opportunity to rapidly grow our Service business, which further enhances long-term margins. This strategy has been very successful for us, particularly in 2017 as we accelerated investments. The negative price versus material cost impact is primarily the mix impact of entrants into these new markets, compounded by material inflation, which has been persistent in the region. It's resulted in an impact of more than half of our total negative price versus material cost spread in 2017 so it's important to understand the strategy, the temporary impact from the shift in our mix in China and the long-term endgame. We expect a few things to improve in 2018. First, pricing should improve in these markets as we move through the year. Second, we expect a less-inflationary environment in 2018 as we begin to lap 2017 inflation. Third, we've largely completed the necessary infrastructure investments to complete execution of our strategy in 2018 so these investments should become less of a headwind versus 2017. And lastly, we're focused on growing our services mix in these markets, which should enhance future margins.  In summary, for the reasons stated, we expect China to be EPS-accretive in 2018 and believe our investments here will help build shareholder value for years to come. Please go to Slide 22. Looking at 2018, we expect to deliver improved operating leverage through the P&L based on a number of factors. First, we expect to drive profitable volume growth based on the continued health of our core markets, as Sue detailed earlier. We also expect to see higher pricing in 2018 versus 2017 and have already put through price increases to cover expected inflation in many parts of our business, which should improve our price versus material cost equation.  In 2017, we had a negative price versus material inflation spread of approximately 60 basis points. We expect to narrow this gap considerably, which in and of itself would be a tailwind to margins in 2018. Additionally, we continue to drive material and other productivity through the P&L, which is always an important driver of margin improvement in our business operating system. Looking at the positive price we've seen, combined with the positive material cost productivity we've driven, which is a component of our productivity bridge, we had a positive spread versus material inflation of 70 basis points in 2017 and would expect similar performance in 2018. Additionally, we will see a reduction in headwinds from our China strategy as I detailed earlier.  And lastly, as discussed at our Analyst Day, we see good opportunity to deliver significantly higher levels of profitability in our large engineered-to-order compressor technology, an increasing demand for our higher-margin tools, Fluid Management and Material Handling products, along with continued mix shift from golf to consumer small electric vehicles. Please go to Slide 23. This has been a key topic of interest in the past so we wanted to include it in our prepared remarks as we close out the year. The bottom line is that our Thermo King business is resilient and our 2017 performance bears this out. During 2017, we achieved a low single-digit increase in total Thermo King revenues in the face of a North American trailer market decline and we maintained relatively flat margins for the business at the same time. Our diversification strategy yielded results, with growth in worldwide truck, auxiliary power units, aftermarket and with particular regional strength in Asia. Looking at 2018, we're expecting similar performance across the business.  Please go to Slide 24. As previously discussed, we have spent or committed approximately $460 million over the past 12 months on strategic acquisitions or JV partnerships. In January, we announced our JV with Mitsubishi Electric, which is pending regulatory approval. Once completed, the new joint venture will include marketing, sales and distribution support of variable-speed mini-split, multi-split, and variable refrigerant flow heating and air conditioning systems in the U.S. and select Latin American countries. We also announced our acquisition of ICS Cool Energy. ICS Cool Energy is one of the largest temporary HVAC rental businesses in Western Europe. ICS Cool Energy also sells, installs and services high-performance temperature control systems for all types of Industrial processes. The strong fit with our HVAC business, expands our sales and service channel in key Western European markets and strengthens our growth plans. Turning to Slide 25. I'll close our prepared remarks where I began. I've never been more excited about the future prospects at Ingersoll Rand in my tenure as CEO than I am right now. The company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably, supported by global market trends such as energy efficiency and sustainability. We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth.  We've experienced management and a high-performing team culture that breathes operational excellence in everything we do. And lastly, we are committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years. 2017 was a good example. We had balanced execution of capital deployment across a number of high-priorities, high-ROI areas, including investment in the business, a strong and growing dividend, value accretive M&A and significant share repurchases as the stock continues to trade below its intrinsic value. Going forward, these priorities remain the same and our commitment to the deployment of excess capital is unchanged.  And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Winoker from UBS. Steven Winoker : Just a -- first on guidance. Just want to understand, again, the relationship between the bookings that are trending 8% organic and 3% to 3.5% organic guidance on growth. Obviously, there's a lag time and kind of order-to-delivery in the industrial side, but maybe help us understand that. And also on the free cash flow conversion, I guess the CapEx increase, is there inventory build? Are there other things that kind of forcing that step down versus prior year? Michael Lamach : Steve, I'll do the first one, which the bookings came late in the fourth quarter and so the exact timing of some of the larger compressor and Applied shipments would still be a question mark so whether that's a fourth quarter '18 or first quarter of '19 delivery, it's TBD and we'll update that throughout the year, but bookings were definitely much stronger and that was a plus -- a surprise really from where we thought we would be at the end of the year. Backlogs were up about 12% going into the year so we'll update shipments as we go further end of the year. And Sue, on CapEx? Susan Carter : Yes. So on CapEx, Steve, as we look at it, so we guided $300 million for 2018. When we started out the 2017 guidance, we gave you about $250 million. We came in at about $220 million so in other words, $30 million was really CapEx that we didn't spend in 2017 that we're going to move over into 2018 so you have just a slight amount of increase. The other thing that I would say is when you think about the $300 million, the $300 million is primarily going to be new product introduction. It's going to -- the capital associated with that is going to be on factories for increasing productivity and increasing cost-reduction ideas in our factories. So those primary objectives when you think about them, are very clear with our growing operating margin and operating leverage. So we think that, that $300 million is a good use of capital for 2018. Steven Winoker : Okay, and Mike, just at a higher level. If we go back to the time that you took over, and all of the changes that you've made, particularly on the product development and introduction front, you've clearly run ahead on share of a number of HVAC competitors over this time frame, but now, we're seeing some of these other guys actually stepping up their own product introductions very aggressively, stepping up their own channel investment apparently more aggressively. Do you see the competitive environment getting more intense at all? Any forward thoughts on how that might impact the broader pricing, et cetera, your ability to stay ahead? Michael Lamach : Yes. Steve, thanks. It's hard to look back now over 9 years. It's seems like -- it's a long time to look back, but one thing that we've been consistent about is just the level of investment that we've been pounding through every year on good ROIC out of projects, as Sue mentioned, stepping up capital in those areas. The innovation pipeline looks solid. We had a lot of introductions in '17, more planned for '18 so I think we do have a positive gap in the technologies and systems that we're putting out in the marketplace and we've always known that. We've got large competitors out there that are capable as well. So we intend to just continue to keep the drumbeat moving and keep innovation out in front. So we know where the competition is at relative to current launches and we know what our pipeline looks like and I would imagine that we're going to be able to maintain technology, positive GAAP for some time. Operator : And your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Just a couple of things, if I could also -- Mike, just on the sales outlook you addressed Industrial, it also seems like you'd ask the same question about Climate given the way you're exiting here. Is there anything in particular in the tone of orders or the forward look that gives you some pause in the top line in Climate for 2018? Michael Lamach : Jeff, when you say some pause, just tell me what you're referring to there? Jeffrey Sprague : Well, I'm just looking at order rates that would seem to support maybe more than 3% organic growth in the business for 2018. Michael Lamach : Yes, I mean, the thing we don't know, Jeff, is really the timing of fourth quarter and first quarter whether it's '18 or '19. And these large bookings come in very late in the year, and we're really trying to assess at this point in time exactly when customers are going to need them so it's difficult to predict and then clearly, carrying 12% increased backlog year-over-year is a great thing relative to the revenue guidance that we've given. These are longer lead, large projects that we just need to work through a little more time to understand the exact timing. Jeffrey Sprague : And could you elaborate a little bit, Mike, just on your confidence on better China price in 2018? Is that -- does that reflect just outright price increase initiatives? Or is it something that's happening in the mix of the business? A little color there to understand how that plays out. Michael Lamach : So Jeff, we've been increasing price throughout our Climate globally, including Climate -- throughout 2017, and the back half of the year in particular. So I'm confident that pricing increases because we've -- in some ways, priced those projects coming through to shipment in 2018. I think competitive dynamics there would point to rising prices in China as well. So I think that markets there are recovering and commodities been something that's been felt by all competition so you're seeing pricing coming through in the marketplace. And I think we've got a pretty good handle on what's happening, at least early in the year from a commodity perspective so I feel like that gap is certainly going to close across the company and China. Beginning in the first quarter, frankly, the gap closes and then throughout the year. It's not really a hockey stick at all, I mean, it's not a first half, second half equation. I think that the leverage, frankly, is fairly linear throughout the year for us. Jeffrey Sprague : And just a quick one for Sue, if I could. Repatriating 10% or 20% of your cash so are you suggesting that although you're on an Irish territorial system before some of your cash was stranded, are you now pulling that back or was there some other nuance in that comment? Susan Carter : No. There was no nuance in the comment, Jeff. What that really is, is some of our international entities that roll up under the U.S. structure so the entities report into the U.S. and whereas previously, we had access to our cash through intercompany loans and through other mechanisms. We're going to use the tax reform and the repatriation tax that we're going to pay over the next 8 years to bring back a small portion of that cash to the U.S. And so you can obviously calculate this as roughly about $300 million and the only reason, really, to signal that is we did not have a lot of cash that we did not have access to or that was a big part of the repatriation so I was just trying to give you context on what the amount would be. And the reason it's an approximation is we have to go through all of the detailed works now that we've figured out the amount of tax. With -- what the in-country rules are, how you would go about doing that timing of doing that, et cetera. So it was nothing more than a nuance to give you an idea of how much cash would come back to the U.S. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Can you just give us a little bit of color on what kind of price you're assuming in the guide here year-over-year, just roughly, for the company? Michael Lamach : Yes, Steve. I'd really tell you that -- I'd start by saying that nothing changes around how we target and think about the operating system of the company, trying to get a 20, 30 basis point positive spread off material inflation. So all the internal plans and all the incentive plans, if you will, are set to be able to achieve that. We've essentially thought about the year as being relatively flat in terms of price, material inflation and we set in place or in motion productivity ideas on a contingency basis that you could even handle, say, a negative 30 and still be able to achieve the midpoint of guidance. So we're really set for kind of a minus 30, plus 30 with a spread roughly at 0, that's how I would think about that. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And again, you're not assuming flat price. You're assuming some price to offset the commodity, just to be clear on that, right? Michael Lamach : No, it's absolutely price. And on top of that, there's absolutely material productivity on top of that. So absolutely price. C. Stephen Tusa : Is most of that material productivity, is some of that coming from copper to aluminum? Or has that kind of already run its course? I know you guys were kind of ahead of the game on that front in resi at least? Or is it just blocking and tackling around product design? Michael Lamach : No, it's a number of things, but supplier consolidation to the preferred supplier program helps, that would be a driver. Material usage, so the quantity and gauge of material used. Material change, as you mentioned, would be another one and then there'd actually be product design as well. So all of that will contribute to a material productivity number. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then just one last one. You mentioned that, in the press release, it sounded as if the China headwinds would be with you here in the first half, although remedy pretty well for the full year. You just mentioned the base, you're going to be linear on price cost over the course of the year. Should we think about the year as being any different from a seasonality perspective? And I think in the past, you've said 45%-ish of earnings in the first half, I think 10% to 12% in the first quarter. How should we kind of think about, at a high level, the seasonality of the year with these dynamics? Michael Lamach : Sequentially on your first question, really around pricing material cost inflation. We improved Q4 to Q1. It improves dramatically. You could think about maybe 50 basis points would be something that we would be thinking about in terms of that. So it's an immediate improvement, I think, Q1 and Q4 from that point of view. As it relates to the seasonality, I think you're right. If you go back over a 4-, 5-year average, it runs, say, 10.5% to 12.5%. I would tell you that at least initially, I would be guiding you toward the lower end of that as it relates to just making sure that we've got this all contained around price [indiscernible]  inflation. And it flows through the way that it should. So again, we feel good about what we're doing, but clearly, we fully understand the burden of proof is on the first quarter and so we're prepared for that. C. Stephen Tusa : Yes. Well, in the past, you guys have smartly set a low bar and beat it so kudos to you guys for keeping things reasonable here and not seem to stretch. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, in the past, you talked about having good visibility into North American commercial HVAC markets and it looks like bookings accelerated again in the quarter. Was that just easier comparisons? Did you see any pickup from hurricane-related work? And can you talk about any differences you're seeing in Applied versus unitary markets? Michael Lamach : Remember quarter 4 last year for us was -- in '16 was really strong so I think that the strong quarter 4 that we booked is coming back to back really off combined healthy stack of bookings. So that -- there's no easy comp there at all for us. There's larger projects that we have not planned into '18 that would dramatically change '18 and that would create a comp, obviously, issue for '19, but there really no comp issues other than tough comps, '17 to '18 from that point of view. Visibility really hasn't changed much. Institutional projects take longer. They're something that we work on with customers to help design and specify and then walk -- move through the process of tendering and awarding and executing. So we tend to have more visibility on that and that continues. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay, that's helpful. And then you mentioned the Industrial team is doing a good job on margin, but if I look at the incremental margin, it was mid-30s in 4Q, it looks like you're only guiding to sort of mid-20s in '18. I know you talked about the large engineered-to-order compressor starting to ramp, which you know have been a bit of a drag on margin so and we know you've taken a lot of costs out of business. So again, is it just kind of conservatism? You've got to wait to see how this ramps up, but you could have pretty strong incremental margin growth in '18, if all things sort of set up the way they could? Michael Lamach : Well, we feel good about the variable cost leverage and it really depends on how much of the shipments come through in the year and how much fixed cost leverage do we get on that volume. So it really is something that will play out through the year for us, but clearly, a great 2017 and more confidence kind of going into '18 and '19, and really confidence around the 2020 outlook that we gave some time ago that this business is really ahead of schedule on that front and performing well. Operator : And your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Mike, maybe going back to that commentary you made on price cost with plus or minus 30 basis points this year. If you think about the major inputs, typically you guys hedge copper ahead of the year so I'd be curious to get any details on that. And then last year, clearly, Chinese steel was a huge negative impact being up, call it 40% last year. It seems like where we are today, it seems like that's a lot more manageable. And so I guess my question is, first, maybe some more details around your assumptions? And then secondly, what could kind of -- what are the biggest swing factors in your mind to maybe even getting positive price/cost this year? Susan Carter : Joe, let me start out on the material inflation side and what we're seeing in 2018. So one, there's obviously the Tier 1 commodities that are inflationary, Tier 2 and then there's also other components so what I want to point out is that refrigerants are going to be inflationary in 2018 and let's call that about 10% of our overall inflation. We've also got some lead that goes into the Club Car product that will be inflationary. After that as I break it down, what we expect to see is inflation in Tier 1 commodities. It's going to be about half of the inflation that we see spread between copper, steel and aluminum. And so when I think about copper, we do lock copper as we go forward. So we're going to enter any given quarter with about 70% of that locked, and we're entering 2018 just under 70% locked on, on copper for the year, but we do expect that to be an inflationary component. You're also correct, Joe, that when you think about the globe in terms of commodities and what happens in '17 and what we also expect to see in 2018, is that Asia is performing differently than prior expectations so before 2017, i.e., they did take some steel capacity off-line. They've done other things that have kept some of their material inflation, actually pretty high compared to what you would normally see and then in the U.S., not having options for steel purchases offshore and using what's happening is another large part of that. So we do expect to see inflation in copper, aluminum as well as some steel perhaps in the later part of the year. But I also point out the refrigerant and some of the other components. Michael Lamach : Joe, I think about it as, and I said before that the nature of 2018 inflation, it seems more manageable to us than 2017. Some of that's got to do with the fact that copper is easier for us to take a look at and lock appropriately and steel, you get a little bit longer view and it's sort of at a level right now where unless there's any trade policy shocks again to the system, we feel that it's a more predictable environment. So just in general the nature or the profile of where the inflation is, is a bit easier for us to maintain, including refrigerants. Joseph Ritchie : Got it, that's helpful. And maybe just kind of switching gears, going back to Industrial for a second. I mean, you're starting the year in such a better spot than you were last year just with your longer-cycle backlog and clearly, short-cycle trends remain good. When you look at the performance that you got this year from a margin perspective, it seems like -- I mean, it seems like you're being very conservative with your margin assumptions for 2018. And so to the extent you can comment on that and then specifically around what are you getting from a pricing perspective as well on these orders because it seems like your competitors are also putting through decent pricing increases. Michael Lamach : Yes, industrial pricing has been really good. It's been great and direct to our productivity, there's been less of a factor too. So you're dealing with good price and material inflation that's a bit more predictable than it's been on the Climate side, that's all the way positive. Restructuring that we're doing in '18, roughly, let's call it $60 million in restructuring there, about 2/3 of that really is completed really now in January and it's about 2/3 of the total and it's really geared in the Industrial area. So really, thinking about how that will flow through during the course of the year and what the paybacks might look like when complete. There's an opportunity there. I like to say there's an opportunity more than there's a risk there, but there's an opportunity there perhaps for us to maybe to do better. So I'm really optimistic about what's happened with bookings there, what's happened with the margins being ahead of schedule and the fact that we've got an early start toward the productivity requirements that we need to have in '18 and '19 there. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. If I can sneak one more in. Sue, pending share count for the year? Susan Carter : For 2018? Joseph Ritchie : 2017. Susan Carter : 2017, the average diluted shares was about 253. Joseph Ritchie : Okay, average, but what was -- so what was ending? For 12/31? Michael Lamach : Joe, we'll come back and grab another call. We'll find the number. Susan Carter : Yes, I don't know... Michael Lamach : We'll follow up and grab another question. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Richard Kwas : Mike, on institutional projects, you've talked about a couple or 3 projects that you thought could come online in '18. Is that embedded in the forecast -- revenue forecast or those pushed out a bit? Michael Lamach : No, they're not. They're not in the '18 forecast. That would be outside of the forecast, but they're too big to throw in the number and forecast them. If they hit, then they're going to be delivered really some in '18, but '19 and '20, they're going to be multiyear projects. Richard Kwas : Okay, all right. And then on M&A, with regards to the stuff done in '17, is there a profit number, EPS number we can think about contributing to the guide? Susan Carter : Yes, Rich, here's how we looked at the M&A. So we talked about it, it would be about 1 point of revenue. We also are factoring in about mid-teens EBITDA on those, which would equate to about $0.06 in 2018 and increasing in 2019 to a $0.15 to $0.16 EPS increase. Michael Lamach : And EBITDA sort of in the higher teens closer to 20%, really, the difference in '18 is just a step-up, but really good businesses. Richard Kwas : All right, okay. And then last one on -- you had some high-cost debt, or relatively high-cost debt that's maturing in '18. I assume that's not factored into the guide, but what are the kind of thoughts around refi-ing that, it seems like you would be able to refi that at a pretty attractive rate at this point. Susan Carter : That's exactly right. So our intention is to refinance the 2018 notes that come due in August of 2018. You're also correct, it's at 6.75% and obviously, rates are much lower than that at this point. So we do intend to refinance. We're watching the markets and also being very conscious on any early break premiums and making sure that we've got the right mix there, but we do intend to refinance those. Operator : Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. David Raso : On the price cost, it hasn't been positive year-over-year since 3Q '16, but what you're saying for '18, given the first quarter, I suspect there's a quarter coming up at least in the base case that you see it turning positive again. Can you give us some sense of the cadence, how we think about that? Is that kind of a post-China sell-through and it's more of a third quarter back half? Or could that even be on the table for as soon as 2Q? At least as your base case guidance. Michael Lamach : Yes, I mentioned, David. Yes, quarter 4, quarter 1, sequentially, it's probably 50 basis points better and for the full year, it gets flat. Quarter 1 would still be a negative relationship so it does imply sort of a second, third, fourth quarter improving. And you'll see it improve throughout the balance of the year as shipments are made in Q2, Q3, Q4, pricing already established and material cost that hopefully we've got a handle on the inflationary numbers. So they sequentially get better throughout the year. David Raso : And just so we understand and get comfort with the 50 bp improvement from 4Q to 1Q, so basically 4Q is down 80 bps. You're thinking the first quarter, call it 30. How much of that improvement is what's happening in China? Or how much is it your price actions you took to start this year and sort of what you're seeing year-to-date on price cost in the backlog? Michael Lamach : Well it's all of the above, but if say, 50% of the whole price material cost relationship was China and if you throw the Middle East in there, you can say it's closer to 70% is China and the Middle East, but I would tell you that the China element really proportionately improved throughout the year as with the rest of the world. Pricing environment, China, we assume is getting better that's been our experience so far as we've highlighted here earlier. We feel like the material inflation, part of that now is somewhat under control with capacity really being not rationalized in the marketplace and we feel better about that. David Raso : Not to push a little bit, but again, of that improvement, how much is that something -- you're sort of seeing in the backlog today, domestically how -- basically we haven't -- in a way, it's still deteriorating, right? We've gone from 50 bps, 50 bps, 70 bps, now 80 bps. Even a second derivative improvement will at least start to add some credence to hey, we're maybe getting through the worst of price cost? So I think your first quarter comment is significant, it's positive if it can develop. I'm just trying to understand, exactly, the line of sight on that. I mean, how much is it? The orders coming in today have a better price/cost. Michael Lamach : Yes. In a commercial space, quarter 1, we're shipping what we've already booked so we feel like the pricing there is pretty well established at this point. There is book and turn, but where there's book and turn, it's typically dealt with by list prices so you think about unitary product is going to have more of a list price than Applied, which is going to be very project-specific. Well, the Applied project-specific has been quoted third quarter, fourth quarter and shipping in the first and second quarter. The unitary had price increases go through as did our competitors. David Raso : Yes, it just seems that the unitary market is seeing a little better price realization to start the year. And the Applied, as you said, has already been booked. So I'm just trying to make sure what the framework here looks like, there clearly should be a second derivative improvement, no doubt price cost, 1Q versus what we just saw. But the line of sight given you have the Applied, the unitary feels like what it's doing in the channel, China is sort of the wildcard. We really should see, hopefully, there's the full 50 bps, right. I mean that doesn't feel like that's, let's say guesstimate, but it seems like something you have a good line of sight for the first quarter, that's a fair assumption? Michael Lamach : David, something would really have to change in the first quarter here and the last couple of months for that to really change my guidance [indiscernible]  here. And I don't know what that would be at this point. David Raso : Just real quick. On Thermo King domestic, I see you have North America trailer down for '18. Lately, you've seen -- I know they're lumpy, but lately, you've seen some better orders out of the domestic market. Is Thermo King's trailer backlog right now not seeing any of that? Is there a bit of a tick up, but it's just too large a hole to kind of dig out of to be flat to up for the year? Just trying to understand that guide versus what we've seen of late. Michael Lamach : Yes, as we become less dependent around growth and margin for North American trailer, we're really just utilizing the ACT data here. So we're not going to try to guess any more than ACT on that. And it always comes down to which customers are ordering from who, and so it's too hard to predict at this point in the year, but ACT is calling the market down, and we're just reflecting what they're saying. Operator : And your next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO. Joel Tiss : Snuck on there. I wanted to ask sort of a little more structurally about the enterprise initiatives in, I guess my thought is, maybe that they're running out of steam a little bit, but I wanted to ask it more about the flexibility. Is there a way to increase the flexibility when you see changes in the market? And I'm just kind of thinking about in the future maybe we're going to see some headwinds just from the cycle. Michael Lamach : Joel, there's no way that we're losing steam. The productivity ideas that we've got across the company. In fact, we're attacking parts that we haven't attacked in the past, warehousing logistics, G&A cost, where the profile of the company has changed over the years and now we're catching up in some of those areas. So I don't -- in a short -- the time we've got here, it would be difficult to tell you about all the areas we've got, but I've got confidence that we're not running out of any steam here at all in productivity. Operator : And I'd now like to turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : We'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. We'll be around in the coming days and weeks to take any questions that you may have, and I think Mike also wanted to make one closing comment as well. Michael Lamach : Yes, just one last comment. This is Joe Fimbianti's last quarterly call with us. And from all of us at Ingersoll Rand and many of the people that you've known over the years Joe on the call, thank you for 41 years, 120 earnings calls, beginning in April of 1988, we wish you and your wife a great, long, healthy retirement, Joe. Thank you. Joseph Fimbianti : Thank you, Mike, it's been an honor. Zac Nagle : Thank you, everyone. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and then a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you will find the accompanying presentation.  We are also recording and archiving this call on our website.  Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.  The participants on this morning's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO.  With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us today.  Please go to Slide 3. We're off to a strong start for the year, but before I get into the details, I'd like to begin the call with a brief review of the fundamental elements of our business strategy, which drives long-term value creation for shareholders.  The first element of our strategy is to continually deliver profitable growth through leadership positions in durable markets.  Our end markets are underpinned by global mega trends such as sustainability and the need to dramatically reduce energy demand and resource constraints in buildings, homes, industrial and transport markets around the world. We focus on innovation and delivering the most reliable, energy-efficient and environmentally-friendly products and services available, enabled by digital and other exponential technologies.  We excel at delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food waste, preserving natural resources and generating productivity for our customers. We invest heavily in products and solutions to support our competitive edge here, and this continues to be a winning formula for us with our customers and our end markets.  Our continued strong growth rates reflect that advantage. We also take the same advice we give our customers seriously. In 2014, we publicly committed to increase our energy efficiency and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions related to our operations and products.  The commitment includes a 35% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations by 2020, which we achieved earlier this year, 2 years ahead of schedule. We conducted an energy audit of our own large facilities and upgraded air-conditioning systems, building controls and lighting, and eliminated energy leakage from our compressed air systems while measuring, validating, and reporting the results.  We are continuing to deepen our commitment with investments in renewable energy, both on-site at some of our large locations and offsite through a power purchase agreement. We engaged our own Trane energy services business to provide a road map in how to be smarter about our energy purchases and to organize investments that are responsible to the environment and good for our business. As it relates to energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we're proud to be walking the talk.  Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at delivering strong top line, incremental margins and free cash flow over the long term. Our business operating system underpins everything we do and enables us to consistently generate high levels of free cash flow, which drives our dynamic capital allocation strategy.  And finally, over the years, we've built an experienced management team and a high-performance culture, which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver strong results consistently over the long term. As we consistently execute our strategy, we continue to build a stronger, more sustainable company for the long term, well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns. Moving to Slide 4. I'd like to spend some time discussing how things are shaping up at this early stage in the year. It's important to note that given the seasonality of our business being heavily weighted towards Q2 and Q3, we are just a small fraction of the way into 2018.  As I said earlier, we are off to a strong start and there are a lot of things that are going well. Our end markets are strong, and we are executing well as evidenced by our high levels of growth in both bookings and revenues globally in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Our Industrial segment continues to make steady improvement ahead of our expectations. All the hard work our Industrial team has done to transform the business commercially and operationally and to restructure the business to take costs out of the system is paying off.  The Industrial end markets are also showing steady signs of recovery, which is positive. Our China direct HVAC sales strategy that we've been highlighting since early 2017 is performing as expected with continued exceptional growth in the marketplace and with improving financials. We're also seeing positive signs that the North American trailer market will likely perform better than most had anticipated entering the year based on tight industry capacity, regulatory changes and U.S. tax reform.  Lastly, we're achieving positive pricing that is consistent with our expectations in targeted end markets to combat material cost inflation.  On the other side of the ledger, the material inflation across the industry and for Ingersoll Rand is both volatile and persistent and continues to be a headwind. We realized adjusted operating margin expansion of 20 basis points, despite these increasing headwinds, through strong volume and price.  Commodity headwinds are broad-based across Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets and in freight, where tight industry capacity is ratcheting up freight cost materially. We're managing the entire P&L to drive margin expansion in 2018 and are taking decisive actions across volume, pricing, productivity and our cost structure to help mitigate further impacts from inflationary headwinds.  There are also a few wild cards in play, including potential tariffs, potential for trade wars and significant geopolitical uncertainty, that challenge the visibility into full year 2018.  On balance, while it's still very early in the year, our Q1 results and our positive outlook for the balance of the year are encouraging and gives us confidence that we are well positioned to exceed the top end of our annual guidance ranges on both revenues and earnings per share.  We'll provide a detailed guidance update, after we have a couple quarters under our belt, on our Q2 earnings call, consistent with our guidance cadence.  Please go to Slide 5. We've adopted a somewhat different format this quarter. We'll continue to provide transparency around the directional changes in bookings and revenue. Historically, the level of detail we provided, combined with the success of our strategic growth programs, has offered a high level of specificity on our performance for investors but can create competitive challenges.  Our intent is to provide additional insight into the key qualitative factors behind the numbers that are driving performance without providing a competitive road map. This format should provide investors a greater fundamental understanding of our business, which we believe is in the best interest of the company and our shareholders over time. For the sell-side analysts out there that follow the company, we really aren't trying to drive you crazy, but we are trying to be pragmatic in how we run the business.  In the first quarter, we drove positive growth in bookings and revenue across the board, as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. Over the past few quarters, we have seen positive signs of a steady recovery in our Industrial end markets. Combined with continued healthy growth in the majority of our Climate businesses globally, we saw positive growth across the board in the first quarter.  Please go to Slide #6. This slide provides insights and color into the key drivers behind the chart in Slide 5 and how we're thinking about the outlook for the year, albeit still at a very early stage.  In commercial HVAC, we're seeing positive growth in the markets globally, with good growth in both equipment and services. North America growth was solid with gains in equipment and particular strength in services, contracting and controls.  Institutional growth was solid, led by the education and health care markets. Europe, the Middle East and Africa commercial HVAC had solid growth across the board, and we saw additional growth in services from our rental service business, ICS Cool Energy, which we discussed on our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call and closed early in the first quarter. Our direct sales strategy in China is on track with our expectations, where we're seeing continued strong revenue growth and expect improving financials in 2018.  Our outlook for total commercial HVAC remains healthy for 2018, and key economic and market indicators largely support our view.  Turning to residential HVAC, the revenues were also strong with continued share gain. Our market-leading Trane Go, our online total installed pricing transparency tool that we referenced during our Investor Day last year, is delivering well against our expectations with significant growth in leads and high conversion rates from leads to sales.  Key economic indicators in this market also support continued growth through 2018, although we and the industry are lapping tough compares versus high growth rates in 2017. So that's an important factor to keep in mind.  Transport continues to be a good news story for us. Our business remains diversified and resilient. We're also seeing improvement in the North American trailer outlook for 2018, fueled by tight shipping capacity, regulatory reforms and the benefit of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that allows for the immediate expensing of certain capital equipment purchases. We saw a solid order momentum in quarter 1.  APU growth remains strong. The marine market is showing considerable strength through the first quarter, although we have a relatively modest size marine business. Bus and rail were mixed, again, off a relatively modest size base for us.  We're seeing continued solid growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa truck and trailer. We built this into a nice size business for us over time. Overall, the transport market should be stronger than we originally expected in 2018, primarily led by improvements in North America trailer and continued solid performance elsewhere.  Compression Technologies & Service is seeing continued signs of industrial recovery, consistent with industrial production and other key indicators.  Quarter 1 bookings and revenue growth was led by North America and China, with particular strength in services. For 2018, we expect to see solid growth in the majority of our markets and products. Small electric vehicle growth was healthy, driven largely by successful market penetration of our consumer vehicle, and we expect that to continue through 2018.  We also expect to see continued good growth in our Industrial Products business, which is off to a strong start in quarter 1.  I hope this provides you with additional insight into our business and what we're seeing at this stage in the year.  And now, I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue? Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #7. We delivered strong operating results in the first quarter, headlined by 23% year-over-year adjusted earnings per share growth.  Gains were driven by operating income improvement in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Revenue growth was primarily driven by strong volumes and supported by the realization of positive price on key products.  Inflation was higher than we planned and a significant headwind to margin expansion. As Mike outlined earlier, netting out our Q1 performance and our visibility into the balance of the year, we are confident that we will exceed the high end of our guidance ranges on both revenue and earnings per share.  We took $44 million in restructuring charges in Q1, driven primarily by footprint optimization in our Compression Technologies businesses as we continue to work to optimize that business for peak future performance.  It's important to note that this restructuring was planned for Q1 as a part of our annual guidance of approximately $0.20 of restructuring. This is unchanged.  Our Industrial business continues to perform well with good growth and 190 basis points of adjusted margin expansion. The investments we've made in fundamentally restructuring the business operations are paying off.  Capital allocation was balanced in the quarter. We paid $112 million in dividends and repurchased $250 million in shares. Our acquisition pipeline remains active, and we anticipate regulatory approval of the Trane JV with Mitsubishi in the second quarter.  Please go to Slide #8. As we've discussed, strong organic revenue growth coupled with adjusted operating margin expansion led to strong adjusted earnings per share growth in the quarter.  Foreign exchange and acquisition-related growth also provided tailwinds on reported revenues.  Please go to Slide #9. Operating margin improvement was primarily driven by strong volume and positive price, partially offset by inflationary headwinds and continued investments in high-ROI projects.  Productivity in the quarter was low year-over-year but consistent with our expectations based on the timing of projects, and we expect improvement for the balance of the year. The 40 basis points negative price versus material inflation was largely consistent with our expectations for sequential improvement on this metric despite significantly higher inflationary headwinds in the quarter.  Please go to Slide #10. Strong operating income expansion in both our Climate and Industrial segments combined for approximately $0.14 of earnings per share and were the primary drivers of our 23% earnings per share growth in the quarter. We saw a negative impact of about $0.01 from higher corporate expenses related to stock-based compensation, primarily tied to time-based vesting, $0.01 from discrete interest expense associated with the company's debt refinancing in the quarter and $0.01 from modestly higher effective tax rate year-over-year.  We also saw a $0.02 benefit from the impact of share repurchases in 2017 and 2018 year-to-date. Please go to Slide #11. Climate delivered 8% organic revenue growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating margins were lower by 50 basis points, impacted primarily by strong volume and positive price, more than offset by persistent inflationary headwinds in Tier 1 and Tier 2 materials and freight.  Our direct sales strategy in China performed as expected, and we expect margins to sequentially improve as we move throughout the year.  Please go to Slide 12. Our Industrial business continues to make solid steady improvements in its operating performance. In the quarter, we delivered 9% organic revenue growth and 190 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion.  Please turn to Slide #13. We maintain a strong balance sheet, providing continued optionality as our markets evolve. Free cash flow was consistent with our expectations given normal seasonality in Q1, and we remain on track to deliver free cash flow equal to or greater than net income for the year. Please go to Slide 14. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders.  We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high-ROI technology and innovation, which are vital to our product leadership and market momentum. We have a long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time.  We will continue to make strategic investments in value-accretive technology and channel acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve, and we maintain a minimum commitment to repurchase shares sufficient to offset dilution. We also see value in share repurchases when shares trade below their intrinsic value.  Please go to Slide #16. Moving on to our topics-of-interest section. We have one topic to cover that we know are on the minds of investors and worth addressing in our prepared remarks : Tariffs. I think the most important takeaway for the market is that we follow an in-region, for-region sourcing and manufacturing strategy. More than 95% of our products sold in the U.S. are sourced from the U.S.  Net, the direct impact from U.S. tariffs on foreign imports should be relatively small. Additional tariffs have been proposed by the U.S. and other countries, but the details of those tariffs and the likelihood of their implementation is uncertain and negotiations are ongoing, so it's unclear how that will play out.  We continue to watch this space closely. Over the long term, we are in an industry that recovers cost increases through price.  Now I'd like to turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks before we take Q&A. Mike? Michael Lamach : Thanks, Sue. Please go to Slide 17. We believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably, supported by global mega trends such as energy efficiency and sustainability. We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We have experienced management and a high-performing team culture that breeds operational excellence into everything we do. And lastly, we are committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital, and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years.  And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Winoker of UBS. Steven Winoker : Nice to see this level of growth. I just want to get a sense. Last quarter, you had talked about 1Q earnings contribution kind of being lower than seasonal norm. I think you talked about the low end of a normal 12% to 14% range for EPS. Should we expect that to still hold? Or when you look at the changes late in this quarter, anything that would lead us to not believe in kind of normal seasonality now that we are hitting Q2, normally, I guess, 30% to 33%? Michael Lamach : Yes. Steve, the business over time has diversified in every way. We talked about that with Transport being more resilient, more diverse. The same thing is true in our commercial HVAC business globally, where service was a major contributor to us in the quarter, outstripping equipment growth, and that's through the form of contracts generally, so it's not just repair or fix based on weather. Those sorts of things are helping us smooth out a bit of the earnings. So it's hard to always go back to historical trends and say that that's the business going forward because we're -- over time, like we did with cash, over many years, we've been working on smoothing out the cash profile of the company. So there's an effort inside the company to make sure that we are smoothing out between quarters as best we can. Even in the Club Car business, which has got its own seasonality, the consumer vehicle strategy is a way of offsetting some of that golf seasonality that we normally see there. Steven Winoker : So what does that mean then in terms of what we should think about for the seasonality in Q2? Michael Lamach : I think Q2 and Q3 will always be our strongest quarters. I just don't know that you can take 10% to 15% in quarter 1 and quarter 2, or 45% in quarter 1 and 2 and 55% in quarter 3 and 4 anymore. I think at this point in time, we do know we're going to exceed the top end of our guidance. We don't know yet by how much. And we're going to get back to you in quarter 2 once we've seen quarter 2, and I think we'll be more accurate at that point in time. Steven Winoker : Okay. On productivity versus other inflation, I think that's the first negative one I've seen overall in like 12 quarters. Maybe -- is that just -- and you put investments elsewhere. So maybe a little bit of clarity on that. Or what's the color on that one? Michael Lamach : There were a lot of major large projects that we invested in and executed in quarter 1. And you saw that through restructuring, as an example. So we think we've loaded up the year into 2019, with good productivity to follow. So I would expect to be our normal good productivity offsetting inflation for the year. It's just going to be heavier loaded on larger projects, meaning that there are probably fewer smaller projects we saw in the quarter. But it doesn't change the pipeline, where we try to get 125% of what we think we need for the year into the pipeline. And the pipeline remains healthy. Steven Winoker : Okay. And just on pricing. So you've already put -- kind of run pricing increases through parts of commercial, resi. I mean where are you relative to kind of the price increases given the commodity behavior already? Michael Lamach : Pricing is really hitting expectations for us. We, across the board, achieved what we thought we would do in quarter 1. We closed the gap quite significantly from quarter 4 and believe that quarter 1 might look a little bit like quarter 2. But what we priced and will ship in the back half of the year and how we're thinking about price increases going forward throughout the year should lead to good performance in Q3, Q4. So the guidance we gave last time, which was sort of a plus 30 basis point, minus 30 basis point and advising you towards the minus 30 basis point, we're really operating right within that minus 20, minus 30 window. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, this was the best quarterly Climate booking that we've seen in the last couple of years. If we go back to your guidance for the year, you had talked about mid-single-digit expected organic revenue growth for commercial HVAC. But it seems orders are trending a bit higher than that early, so maybe give us a little more color on the acceleration you've seen in orders. You previously mentioned that you could win some bigger Applied projects. Are any of those in the bookings growth that you've had? Michael Lamach : The nice news is there was nothing in the quarter 1 bookings that we would have called out or spiked out that would be a difficult comp for next year. It was very broad-based across the globe. And so if you think about going across the globe, North America is shaping up about the way we thought it would shape up, solid growth in equipment. And in institutional end markets, education specifically, would be around K-12, say, versus colleges and universities. K-12 is strong. Particularly, with midyear elections coming, we're seeing more bond issuances that are passing or on the dockets for updating aging school infrastructure. That's good news. Health care is strong. It's not so much in acute care. We're seeing that in a lot of the clinics and specialty hospitals there. That's good, there are more of them. That's been positive. Other verticals are generally stable and positive. So if you look at ABI, auto sales, GDP growth, retail sales, nonres fixed construction, vacancy rates, they all look good. They're all stable or healthy, and they would point to low single to mid-single-digit markets, and we would think that Trane will grow at or above the markets in North America. Europe is strong for us, particularly we're seeing that with a very high activity in our own sales pipelines. We're seeing, obviously, good contribution from the rental services business that we acquired in the quarter. Economic indicators there are positive, around mid-single digits. Brexit is a bit of a wild card, but right now it's not showing up as much of an issue for us. Asia is led by China, very strong for us. That's fundamentally the direct sales strategy we put in place. We are very pleased with what we're seeing there, including service growth that we had in the quarter. Realizing it's about half of Asia, other important markets for us like Singapore and Taiwan will be down just a little bit. India will be strong, probably up mid-single digit. And Thailand is a nice market for us as well. We'll see modest growth. So anywhere across the world, and I probably would throw Brazil in there as well. Brazil is a good market for us in the quarter, and we think that that's on the road to recovery. So just about every place we're running commercial HVAC operations, we're seeing good growth. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, that's great color. So Mike or Sue, just shifting gears for a second. You previously mentioned that you could get 50 basis points of margin expansion overall for Ingersoll in '18. Is that kind of margin expansion still possible in this environment given your price increases and you're going to hit productivity projects harder here? Or do you get to sort of the higher -- higher than your guidance, your previous guidance from better organic growth and maybe some modest margin expansion? Like how do we think about that? And specifically focusing on Climate margins as well. Michael Lamach : Yes. Andy, it's early in the year. But I think that when you fundamentally boil it down to operating leverage, we'll see better operating leverage in the back half of the year. Some of this is price/cost relationship. Some of this is the way the productivity and products are loaded into the system. Part of it's based on the assumption that we see continued good volume and mix in the portfolio. So if that goes the way it should go, then I would say that we would see operating leverage for the company along the lines of what we guided to for the full year of 20%, 25%. Operator : Your next question comes from Joseph Ritcher (sic) [ Joseph Ritchie ] of Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Usually my name is pretty easy to pronounce. I want to kind of touch on this, on the price/cost discussion. Mike, 40 basis points of price/cost headwinds this quarter. I know that you guys don't typically love to talk about cadence. But is the right way to think about it that this is kind of the low watermark for price/cost for the year just given the pricing actions that you've taken? Or is 2Q going to look similar to 1Q? I'm just trying to get a sense for what your expectation is. Michael Lamach : Yes, I think Q1 and Q2 will look relatively similar, but Q3 and Q4 pick up. I think Q3, Q4 is relatively flat, particularly quarter 4, meaning we're at that point matching cost increase. Now all that's predicated on us having an understanding of what's happening with inflation to the best of our ability. But from a pricing perspective, we're layering in prices where prices are given to the market. So as an example, HVAC will have a May increase as well. But on projects specifically, which have unique pricing, it's factored into those tools as well for pricing into the marketplace. So I think the back half of the year is stronger, and that's how we kind of get to that minus 20, minus 30 for the end of the year. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. And then maybe just -- I heard you talk about increased freight earlier. But maybe talk a little bit about how that impacted the quarter and what you're seeing on the wage inflation side as well and what you're doing to offset both. Michael Lamach : Well, it's a double-edged sword because if you think about our transport refrigeration customers, they're seeing a 30% increase in their rate per mile and great demand. And if you couple that with what they're doing in terms of taking advantage of tax reform, you're seeing growth in the transport refrigeration market. But on the flipside of that, if you think about the industry, and I'm not going to comment specifically on what we've seen, but I'm going to tell you from an industry perspective on dry freight, it's up about 15% over the prior year. So what I would say is that's sort of the number in the marketplace that is out there, and it's a meaningful number to companies like ours. Joseph Ritchie : That's helpful. Maybe one last one. And just thinking about the guidance for the year. Historically, you guys have provided an update in 1Q. Is it really just a wild card to play at this point, the tariffs and the trade wars, on why you decided at this point to just wait until Q2 even though your commentary suggests that things are going to be better as the year progresses? Michael Lamach : Yes, there was a year, Joe, that we did give a quarter 1 update. But generally speaking, over a long period of time, we've always reserved for that until later in the year. To us, there are a lot of wild cards out there, inflation being one. But tariffs and trade wars is also something that I think is on a lot of people's minds. And we're seeing that frankly on larger industrial projects, decisions being made by customers there, where in that particular customer set, I think there's more concern about tariffs and the cost of input and the location of plants or lines that they would be thinking about either expanding in the U.S. or somewhere else as opposed to tax reform. So -- where in the transportation markets, our trucking customers have taken advantage of tax reform, as an example, not as worried about tariffs. We're seeing a little different response with our industrial customers, I think, delaying some actions. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Can you just talk about how that price/cost headwind -- I think you said negative 40 in the first quarter, how that kind of trends throughout the year? How much worse that -- I would assume it gets a little worse in the second and then recovers into the back half. Michael Lamach : Well, price gets better in the second, so that's true. We think that inflation probably creeps up a little bit again in the second quarter. So you end up Q1, Q2 relatively flat. Kind of think minus 40 basis points is probably a pretty good number there. And as you trend through the back half of the year, there's a more meaningful increase in price. And you're really then offsetting what should be relatively flat inflation at that point because you're lapping pretty high inflation numbers at that point as well. So I think that the back half of the year tends to look flat. The front half of the year tends to look at minus 40. So you're in that minus 20, minus 30 range. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then when you -- I'm not sure you gave this, but can you just talk about what your resi performance was in the quarter from a bookings and revenue perspective? Michael Lamach : Yes, very solid, very solid. Continued share gain there. It was consistent with our expectations. Replacement and new construction both healthy for us, obviously driven by unemployment and GDP being stable and other indicators that are favoring that. The Trane Go platform, which is the whole total installed pricing transparency tool, is really delivering some significant growth for us. And we're seeing higher leads, higher conversion rates. That's again driving the share gain, I think, there for us as well. And you know this very well, Steve, but tougher market compares Q2 to Q4, but we still think the market will be up low to mid-single digits and we expect share gain to continue there for us. C. Stephen Tusa : Were you up double digit in the first quarter? Michael Lamach : Not going to comment on it specifically there. But I would say that there was share gain in the quarter. And obviously, you all know that it was a pretty good quarter for the industry. Operator : Your next question is from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Robert McCarthy : Yes, so 2 questions. I mean, I guess, one, Mike, as you think about making the turn, this puts a fair amount of pressure on your third quarter just to kind of stand and deliver, right? You become a third quarter team because the seasonality and association with your business. So I know you don't want to get into quarterly guidance or the quarterly cadence, but what would be the expectations for incremental margins for the Climate business in the third quarter to kind of cause you to raise your guidance for the full year? What do you think is implied, the line in the sand, for the margin conversion we should expect to see in the third quarter? Michael Lamach : I'd start with this really good visibility around Q3 as we stand here in April, with half the business being service and the other half being equipment, most of that equipment being in the backlog and really not relying heavily on book and turn to drive the business. So I think that the only wild card we really have is, if you think about it, is inflation. Pricing will be set on deliveries that were going to be made. The backlog is being built. The service business is humming along. So I feel good about the ability to say that we're going to top the guidance that we gave at this point in time. I just don't want to be more specific about that until we actually see what happens in quarter 2. Robert McCarthy : And then turning just to capital allocation. Any kind of update there of how you're thinking about things? Particularly given stocks have pulled back there a little bit, cycle definitely looks like a little bit of concern, I mean, any way you're thinking about underlying acquisitions or investments in your own stock through the prism of what is maybe a tougher industrial market? Susan Carter : Well, so, Robert, as we think about capital allocation and we think about Ingersoll Rand, the first part that I want to start with is that we continue to have a strengthening balance sheet. Our process around cash flow, around managing investments has been good and will continue to be good. So when we think about capital allocation, and we talked about this in some of the prepared remarks, I don't think it's different than what we've said before. We're going to continue to invest in the business. And investing in the business can be CapEx, which we guided at $300 million for the year. It can be in new products, it can be in our sales force, but continuing to invest in the business, and that is really important to us. It's having that strong dividend, with growth in the dividend being equal to or greater than our net income. And then when you come to the remainder of the cash flow, I think what you think about is that we are going to deploy the excess cash flow. And how we deploy that last couple of pieces of it is highly dependent on what transpires from the M&A side and the timing of that. We don't have to do anything on M&A, but we do have a good active pipeline. As you can tell from the last 4 or 5 months, we've had some technology, some channel, some other things come through the pipeline that have turned out well for us. And what I'd like to see on the M&A side is our ability to grow earnings and to grow a long-term cash flow stream out of the M&A. And on share repurchase, you're right. Shares and the intrinsic value are showing a positive, and we'll see how that turns out. We have committed to offsetting dilution. We told you in the original guidance that we had modeled $500 million of share repurchase. But when I toggle between those 2, I really would like to see us work the M&A side, work the earnings and cash flow growth side of that, and then be really smart on share repurchase and other aspects of capital allocation. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Mike, you may have partially answered my question on kind of the project industrial comment, but I wonder if you could elaborate there. I was thinking industrial orders could have been stronger in the quarter. Obviously, you had kind of a pretty solid back half and there's some lumpiness there. But how do you see the trajectory in the Industrial business playing out, maybe kind of on the larger capital side of the business versus maybe some of the shorter-cycle elements? Michael Lamach : Yes, let's first talk about 2/3 of the Industrial segment, which is the compressor technology business. And here, we saw really strong growth in services and expect services to continue to grow stronger than equipment, which is great to where our focus is. We also saw a really good growth on short-cycle compressors. We saw growth with some OEM work we do, selling components to other OEMs. And we saw nice growth in oil-free rotaries. So that was excellent growth, and I made the comment already about North America and Asia being stronger regionally. We do see lumpiness, though, in the very large centrifugal projects, and we're seeing some delays there. And it is driven by macro uncertainty regarded -- related to tariffs and some of the risks associated there, but we do expect that to recovery -- to recover as well. North America manufacturing looks healthy. All the verticals there are strong. Processed gas and air separation expected to be strongest -- strong this year as well. Key economic indicators are supportive here. Industrial production's at a 2-year high. Defense-related aerospace forecast is strong, so we think the markets there will be good. [ AP ] will be strong regionally -- strongest regionally for us. We think that China probably is tapering a little bit from 6% GDP, but we're seeing that there's still good growth in the market there as well. On the other third, the other $1 billion of the industrial market, really strong growth in small electric vehicles, particularly as it relates to the consumer strategy. And we saw good growth, if not excellent growth, in the Industrial Products, which for us is going to be Material Handling, it's going to be our tools and our Fluid Management business, which is a very high-margin business for us. Jeffrey Sprague : And then just shifting back to HVAC, and it probably really is more of a resi question. But was there or has there been kind of prebuying in the channel in front of kind of the next wave of price increases? And does that kind of distort things here as we kind of try to figure out Q2? Michael Lamach : Yes, I don't think the price increase or the time they were given were that different than what the expectation would have been in the prior year. So there could be specific distributors that might have done more than they would have done. But as we look at inventories across the backlog, they're pretty appropriate for where they need to be at this point in time. So I don't see tremendous risk there. Jeffrey Sprague : And maybe just one other quick one. How about hedging? I mean, with materials whipping around the way they are, does strategy change? Do you want to hedge more? Do you want to hedge less? You obviously don't want to be kind of \"betting\" on these items. But any color there would be helpful. Susan Carter : Yes. Jeff, I think you've got that exactly right. We don't want to be in the speculation business. But let me give you a couple of thoughts on what we're doing today and maybe options for the future. So today, again, we've gotten visibility on steel. You can't lock it, you can't hedge it. We've gotten visibility of about 6 months, 3 months on pricing and about 3 months on inventory. So we know what that looks like and we know what we have to do in terms of price on the steel side of the market. On copper, we lock copper prices and so we're locking in volumes with our supply base throughout the year. We enter any given quarter at about 70% locked on copper. Actually we're about 66% locked for the year on copper. But what happens on that lock, and I think this is important, is we're giving volume commitments and we're getting pricing commitments out of the supply base. So in other words, the fluctuations on the copper price are actually -- belong to the supply base. So any financial hedges are being done on that side of the house. Now, is there pressure for maybe us to take on a little bit more of that with the change in hedge accounting rules and things like that? The answer is perhaps, and it's perhaps a way to do that. But I think what you would do, even if we hedged the actual copper or aluminum, is you would still layer in your purchases so that you're almost doing a dollar-cost-averaging type of move on buying in those commodities. I think you probably end up in about the same place with a financial hedge versus the locks that are out there. So we continue to refine our thinking around that. We continue to work on the processes, which is getting really good at projecting the volumes, really good at projecting the timing of those. But I really do think it kind of works like it does today, with us getting visibility on our costs so that we can react with pricing if need be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe the first question just on what's happening in your Climate business in China. That was something you called out a few times last year as being a pretty big margin headwind. And you mentioned that the financials are looking slightly better there. So maybe flesh that out that a little bit. And also just strategically, how you're progressing with that market share push. Michael Lamach : Yes, actually I'm going to answer your question and then I'm going to probably add on a little bit, which gets to the -- maybe a little bit of Steve Tusa's last question regarding specific kind of guidance or results in different businesses. But the strategy is going very well for us. There's exceptional equipment organic bookings happening there. Just to give you a point of color, the visibility that we have in our project pipeline, that we would put all projects into a pipeline that are out there for us to pursue, were up 100% year-over-year, meaning they've doubled. So we have visibility to twice as many projects as the prior year. The number of proposals that we provided were up 130%. So the projects we're actually finding are even better projects for us to go pursue, albeit they might be larger or longer-cycle projects that perhaps distribution wasn't getting at, but our company-owned resources, our direct team is getting at. So very strong growth in bookings there. Very strong growth in service there as well, and that is the most important thing. That is mapping how we wanted it to map, which means that the financial pressure there on the margin is getting better, as it was planned and should be getting, year-over-year. And I would say that I've got a high level of confidence that we'll see 2018 margins that are flat to 2017 margins on a much higher revenue base for the year. And I think in 2019 and beyond, it will be a nice tailwind for us as the service business grows. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And secondly, I guess, just within the Climate business, you did see an acceleration in the organic bookings growth in Q1 from late last year. I realize you don't want to get into too much detail, but was that all about Thermo King accelerating or the overall transport refrigeration business? Or did you also see some improvement in the commercial Trane side? Michael Lamach : One versus the other was not remarkable in terms of what drove the business. So there wasn't sort of an outstanding performance in one business covering up for another. And getting back to the question that Steve asked a little bit as well. Over the last, say, 5 years, I've never seen a better linkage from strategy to execution as it relates to the ability for us to identify strategic growth programs, invest the talent and the resources into those and then get really good results, often a multiple of what the underlying growth rate is of the business. And they're mapping exactly to what we planned. And we provide so much detail on these calls, particularly in a tough pricing environment, all we do is put a bull's-eye on the back of our salespeople out in the marketplace around sort of where we're penetrating and who we're beating. So it doesn't really help the company, which means it doesn't help the shareholder, for us to be providing too much of that. And it also invites a lot of short-term-ism into the way that people would think about the business, because a quarter, whether we have a blowout number or don't, really doesn't change the long-term dynamics of what we're trying to do strategically around growing the business. And so again, we thought long and hard about that. Apologize for the sell-siders who really use that to model but believe it's in the best interest long term, certainly for the company's shareholders, that we don't provide that much granular information on a go-forward basis. But back to your question, really good growth both in HVAC and in TK. The surprise to us has been the TK business, which is strengthening globally but also strengthening in North America, specifically around the trailer business that we talked about. Operator : Your next question comes from Tim Wojs of Baird. Timothy Wojs : I just -- I had a question maybe on just the order growth in backlog, and maybe this will just kind of help us a little bit with the back half of the year. Any way in Climate to just kind of think about what the margins are in terms of what you're booking for orders or what's in backlog maybe relative to what we saw even 12 or 18 months ago? Michael Lamach : Well, you'd think about backlog margins being higher because they're going to have higher price than the backlog margin. So if you think about standard costs being roughly the same first half to back half, we're not going to change standards midway through the year. What's different is the pricing coming into that. Plus you're seeing -- hopefully, seeing an additional absorption coming into the factory volumes on the higher revenue. So the margins in the back half of the year are better than the front half of the year, and that's sort of the outlook that we've got on why leverage and ultimately margin expansion for the full year happens. Timothy Wojs : Okay. Okay, great. And then just with some of the movements on the debt side in the quarter, any update in terms of how we should think about interest expense for the year? Susan Carter : Yes, Tim, the 8-K and the information that we put out there -- so let me parse this into 2 parts, which is 2018 and then post-2018. So in 2018, the benefit on interest expense is about $0.11. On Q1, specifically, actually, our interest expense is up very slightly because of actually having interest on both the refinanced tranches as well as the new tranches for a short period of time. If I look beyond 2018, the guidance that we gave was about $0.19 of -- $19 million. Michael Lamach : Million. Susan Carter : Sorry, I said cents. Millions, sorry. $19 million of benefit on 2019 and beyond. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Richard Kwas : Just following up on one of the earlier questions around price/cost. So at the beginning, there was a band of plus 30 to minus 30 for the year, Mike. It sounds like you're in the lower part of that range, but obviously comfortable with how the guidance is going to play out for the year and from an earnings standpoint. Is that the right way to interpret this? Michael Lamach : Yes, in fact, what we talked about was the fact that typically we'd be plus 20, plus 30. We said, \"Look, let's not be so precise because we've had so much inflation and it's so volatile. Let's say it's minus 30, plus 30.\" But within that window, we were confident at that point in time that we were going to able to get the leverage in the business that we had thought about and communicated to you by managing the entire P&L, and that's the intent. Now within that, we said, \"Let's bias it toward the bottom end of that range. Let's play it safe. Let's look at minus 30 as probably being closer to the reality.\" And what we're seeing transpire in the marketplace with price is that we are certainly within the band that we've communicated, say, minus 30. If you look at the spot forecasts, you could say minus 20 today. But understand the volatility in that is moving quite a bit. So I feel good about being in that kind of minus 20, minus 30 bps range at this point, and that will evolve over the course of the year as these wild cards play out. Richard Kwas : Okay. And then -- and I know it's really, really early, but as we think about lap-over impact into '19 from commodity at this point, any early thoughts there, early reads there as you think about it? I mean, obviously, you have some time here from a productivity standpoint to execute some things, but just curious on how you're planning for this looking out 12 months or so. Michael Lamach : Yes, as volatile as it is right now, we're certainly looking at what's happening for the year. So it's not that we're not thinking about '19, but we'd be really stretching to prognosticate much at this point in time. We want to make sure we can call Q3 and Q4. So at this point in time, I'd hold back on comments there. Operator : Your next question comes from Joel Tiss of BMO. Joel Tiss : Almost everything has been answered for me, but just can you break apart the pieces of Thermo King? You usually give us a little bit of a better sense of what's happening across some of the pieces, and I just wondered if you could do that again. Michael Lamach : Yes, it will take a minute because, again, it is a diversified business here. But let's first talk about North America trailer, which is where some of the news is. And here you've got tight shipping capacity, you've got tight labor supply in terms of drivers, all driving the 15% sort of industry increase that I've mentioned. You've got regulatory changes here, which are also impacting. So this is like electronic logging devices, specifically. And then you got the benefit of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. So ACT raised their outlook to 44,600. I think last time we spoke, we were kind of biasing around 41,000, and that was a little better than the original plan, which is around 39,000. I think, frankly, it's somewhere between 41,000 and 44,600, which is what ACT has. ACT may not have thought through some of the constraints around cabs or even about inventory in the marketplace, and so perhaps the number is 2,000 units or so less than that. It's all good news. Europe should be very solid for truck, for trailer as well, broadly. Some markets are stronger than others. Interestingly, Russia is about 15% of the market and it's growing a little faster than Europe as a whole. So there's a wild card there on anything that would happen there with further sanctions in Russia. But generally speaking, it's good growth. The APU market is strong, and that is really tracking Class 8 sleeper cabs. And then our bolt-on rate, kind of where we measure the bolt-on from our units on to the sleeper cabs is increasing, and that's looking like the plan we laid out for you at the Analyst Day over a year ago at this point in time. The marine market is strong. I want to say in the quarter, it was up over 220%, the market was up over 220%. It's a relatively small business for us but good growth there. And then bus, rail and air would be mixed. Rail is longer, larger projects that are good for us. Bus is a lot of the city kind of transit buses. And air is an interesting but small portfolio, where we're seeing more biopharma moved this -- through this route. And you're seeing sort of 10% increase in the market for moving biopharma in refrigerated containers via air. So that's a strong sign around those businesses. But collectively, those bus, rail, air businesses are something like 10% of the portfolio, so not a large part of the portfolio. Good growth in Latin America, specifically Brazil, and continued good growth in Asia. Joel Tiss : And are the prices of acquisitions high enough at this point that we should expect the overall share count to drop a little bit more, or you guys are going to keep your kind of methodical approach and try to balance everything out? Michael Lamach : The methodical approach really is just keeping intrinsic value in front of us as we're looking at an acquisition and trying to make the right long-term decision around the acquisition. So obviously, as the share price drops, it makes the intrinsic value greater. It makes acquisitions a little bit more difficult. But look, if what we see persists, the price of an acquisition should come down, too, as well. So look, let's just let this thing play out. But I think we've shown a very disciplined process over the past few years about what and why we buy and what we pay for. And I can tell you that what we've bought in 2017 is generating far greater EPS in '18 and '19 than share repurchase, but that's because we look at intrinsic value versus the acquisitions and make good decisions and integrated them well into the company. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Barry of Susquehanna. Robert Barry : Yes. I guess I just wanted to -- on the margin lock, to get a sense of how you expected the investment spending to track as we progress. Does that maybe stay at a 40, 50 basis point headwind through the year? Susan Carter : Yes, I think on investment spending, let's call that similar to 2017 as we go through the year. I think what is important, Robert, on the investment spending itself is what that actually is going into. So we're continuing to work on new products. We're continuing to work on our operational excellence initiatives. There's a small amount of IT. But in terms of how we're going to do that throughout the year, it would look similar to 2017. And the changes that we may see as we go through this, and this is an important part of our process, is we've got an investment review board that looks at all of the different components of investments that we do and makes sure that we've got the right business cases, the right value creation for all those investments. And that's a really sound practice for us as part of our business operating system that may impact some of that timing somewhat, but I don't expect it to be terribly different. Robert Barry : Got it, got it. And listen, I can appreciate if you don't want to say any more on this front but -- and others have touched on this. But you were guiding Climate up 3%, 3.5% and you started out 8% with orders up 11%. So I think we're all just trying to get our heads around like what, if anything, is so materially different, or maybe your plan kind of factored something like what we're seeing or there is some shoulder-season volatility in there. But just... Michael Lamach : It actually gets -- yes, it gets very much to my point. It gets very much to my point that strategy is mapping very closely to strategic growth programs and the product growth teams and the success in these markets. And in some cases, I think we're surprising ourselves around the growth here, and that's great. So it was a very strong quarter, delighted to have sort of booked that and put it into the backlog, and we're going to see how quarter 2 and quarter 3 progress. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : I know we've covered a lot of ground here. I did have a follow-up question for Sue. In your answer to Jeff's question on inflation and steel, I think you said that you can't lock in the prices. But just if you could refresh us. My understanding, you engage in advanced purchasing so you basically pre-buy or commit 100% of the volume you expect each quarter and then ladder that out. Is that still the same practice? But aren't you locking that in for the quarter each time? So is that really locked in or not? Susan Carter : All right. So Deane, great question. On steel, what my comment was meant to be is, you cannot do a financial hedge or something of that nature on steel. However, it is a lot like a locking program, where we get visibility from spot prices and commitments, contractual commitments from the suppliers on steel that will go out 3 months. So we've got visibility to the pricing and then we've also got inventory. So we've got about 6 months of visibility to price increases or decreases. It's just a matter of there isn't a financial hedging mechanism that's out there on steel, which could be on copper and aluminum. Deane Dray : Great. That's helpful. And then for Mike, could you update us on the whole initiative around connected buildings? That was a big focus at the analyst meeting. What the take rate is, the number of buildings, the kind of investments you're making, but any color there would be helpful. Michael Lamach : Yes, the whole digital strategy for the company is probably the largest investment, and we look through that across the company. If you look at product growth, it is definitely in the results that we're seeing around why the controls business was up as much as it is. And then specifically on the connected strategy and the growth rates there, we talked about sort of 30% compound growth rate, so we're continuing to see that take shape. We've just made an acquisition in the quarter around another company, a small company, a lot of intellectual property and many, many hundreds of thousands of connections through smart meter technology into our platform. So there is more investment happening there as well, and we're trying to extend and get a larger footprint. But the strategy is growing roughly 30%. You're seeing that show up in our controls business and it's intentional. That's about all I could say there. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now return the call to Zac Nagle for closing comments. Zac Nagle : Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. As always, Shane and I will be available to take your questions today, tomorrow and in the coming days and weeks. We look forward to seeing several of our large investors on the road in the upcoming weeks as well. And I hope everyone has a great day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Please go to Slide 3. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the fundamental elements of our business strategy that drives long-term value creation for shareholders. This is often a helpful starting point for those of you listening, who may be less familiar with the company. First, our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource-constrained as time passes. We excel at delivering energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing food and other waste of perishable goods and generating productivity for our customers, all enabled by digital and other exponential technologies. Our business portfolio positioning creates a platform for the company to consistently grow above average global economic conditions, aided by the strong secular tailwinds that I've outlined.  Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at delivering strong top line growth, incremental margins and free cash flow. Our business operating system underpins everything we do and enables us to consistently generate powerful free cash flow, which, when combined with our dynamic capital allocation strategy, drives strong returns for shareholders over the long term. And finally, over the years, we've built an experienced management team and a high-performance winning culture, which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver strong results that are sustainable for the long run. Having a strong winning culture takes years to build and cultivate, and I believe this is one of the things that the market may underappreciate about Ingersoll Rand. As we consistently execute our strategy, we continue to build a stronger company that delivers reliable and consistent financial performance for shareholders over the long term.  Moving to Slide 4. Midway through the year, we continue to execute well against our long-term strategy and 2018 is shaping up to be a very good year for us. Our end markets are healthy, and we are executing well, as evidenced by the strong growth we're delivering in bookings and revenues in both our Climate and Industrial segments across virtually all products, services and geographies globally.  Our Industrial segment continues to perform well with broad-based bookings and revenue growth and significant margin expansion. We're effectively managing inflation and tariff headwinds. We delivered a 10 basis point positive price versus material inflation spread in the second quarter, which reflects strong pricing discipline and efficiency. Our China growth strategy is performing well against our expectations, with continued strong revenue and bookings growth and improving margins. As we look forward, we expect our end markets to remain healthy, with consistent execution of our business operating system, which gives us confidence in raising our full year guidance revenues, EPS and free cash flow.  Please go to Slide #5. In the second quarter, we delivered strong growth in organic bookings and revenue across the board, as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. Enterprise organic bookings and revenues were up 15% and 9%, respectively. Climate led the way with organic bookings and revenues of 17% and 9%, respectively. And Industrial was also very strong, with organic bookings and revenues up 8% and 9%, respectively. These results represent continued healthy end markets and consistent execution of our strategy. A couple points to highlight. First, we did not see a significant impact from revenue pull-ins ahead of price increases or tariffs in the quarter, and Sue will discuss it in more detail later. And second, we didn't have any large performance contracting orders to call out in the quarter that would've skewed our results. The 1 minus on the chart was in small electric vehicle bookings, where results were only modestly lower. Golf was down, with utility and consumer vehicles showing bookings growth as expected. Please go to Slide #6. This slide provides insight and color into the key drivers behind the chart on Slide 5 and how we're thinking about the outlook for the year. In commercial HVAC, we're seeing sustained growth globally in both bookings and revenue, with good growth in both equipment and services and particular strength in Asia. North America growth remained solid, with gains in equipment, services, contracting and controls. Institutional growth was particularly strong, led by education. And Industrial HVAC strength was also notable in the quarter. Europe, the Middle East and Africa commercial HVAC remained strong with solid growth across the board in equipment and after-market, and we saw additional growth in services from our rental services business. China continued to have a very strong growth in the quarter, led by the execution of our China direct sales growth strategy. Our outlook for total commercial HVAC remains healthy for 2018, and key economic and market indicators largely support our view.  Turning to residential HVAC, bookings and revenue growth were also very strong, particularly against tough growth comps versus 2017. The replacement markets, where the majority of our sales are derived, showed very good growth in the second quarter, and this is expected to continue through 2018. Our transport solutions business continues to be a diversified, resilient business, and the improving market conditions for North America refrigerated trailer have been a positive. North American trailer order growth was strong in the quarter and revenues were up as well. The Americas Commercial Transportation Research Company, also known as ACT, has taken up their forecast for North American refrigerated trailers to approximately 5% growth over 2017.  However, industry capacity by trailer OEMs is constrained, it's not clear how much the industry will actually grow at this stage.  Auxiliary power unit growth remained strong, with good growth in both refrigerated and nonrefrigerated segments. We're also seeing continued solid growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa truck, which is a meaningful business for us. Overall, the transport market should be stronger than we originally expected in 2018, primarily led by improvement in the North American trailer market. Compression Technologies is seeing the continuation of an industrial recovery, consistent with industrial production and other key leading indicators. In the quarter, we delivered good growth in bookings and revenues in both equipment and after-market. All major geographies were solid, with particular strength in Asia. For 2018, we expect to see solid growth broadly across key products, services and markets. Small electric vehicle revenue growth was strong, driven largely by successful market penetration of our consumer vehicle, and we expect that to continue through 2018. We also delivered strong growth across our Industrial Products business, which are comprised of tools, fluid management and material handling. We expect to see continued good growth in our Industrial Products businesses in the second half of the year. And now I would like to turn over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter and to discuss our 2018 guidance increase. Sue? Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #7. As Mike highlighted, strong momentum from the first quarter continued through Q2. Revenue growth in both our Climate and Industrial segments is outpacing our initial guidance expectations. Margins and leverage are improving and the pull-through to EPS growth has been strong.  As we look forward to the second half the year, we continue to see good opportunities for growth broadly across our end markets. We expect sustained strong execution of our business operating system to enable us to deliver financial results that meaningfully exceed our initial full year guidance for revenues, earnings per share and free cash flow. Looking at our second quarter results in more detail. Bookings and revenue performance were both strong, with robust growth in virtually every major product category and geography and in both services and equipment. We delivered record Enterprise bookings and revenues with organic bookings up 15% and organic revenues, up 9%. Climate led the way with organic bookings and revenues up 17% and 9%, respectively.  Industrial organic bookings and revenue were also strong, up 8% and 9%, respectively. After-market growth outpaced equipment growth, up 12% and 11%, respectively, as we continue to focus on building out a greater mix of high-margin, sustainable revenue and margin streams over time.  There's been a fair amount of discussion on the street recently regarding the impact of customers' pre-buying inventory ahead of announced price increases or the anticipated implementation of tariffs, so we wanted to spend a moment addressing this question with respect to Ingersoll Rand. While it is difficult to determine a precise number due to a number of factors, we are confident this was not a substantial factor for us in the second quarter given our channel structure, and the visibility that we do have. We would estimate an impact of between $80 million and $100 million on orders, spread primarily between commercial HVAC, residential HVAC and transport refrigeration. As best we can call it, this would translate into 2 to 3 percentage points of the 15% bookings growth in Q2. The impact of revenues was likely a fraction of this in the quarter and de minimis to the full year.  Through the second quarter, we have continued to execute a balanced capital allocation strategy. Our first priority is always reinvesting in high ROI projects in our business. As we outlined in our original guidance for the year, we also have a number of high ROI capital expenditure-related projects in 2018. These projects are aimed at simplifying our business through footprint optimization and at innovation through new product development-related projects. We've invested in number of these higher ROI projects through the first half.  We have also maintained our commitment to a strong and growing dividend. We announced a quarterly dividend increase of 18% in the second quarter and have distributed $222 million to shareholders in the form of dividends in the first half of 2018.  Share repurchases have also remained a good investment for us as our shares have continued to trade below our calculated intrinsic value. Through June, we have repurchased $500 million at an average price of $88.53. On the acquisition front, we closed on the Trane-Mitsubishi Electric JV, which is now up and running, and our acquisition pipeline remains active. Through the second quarter, our total cash spend on M&A is approximately $280 million, including the ICS Cool Energy acquisition and the Trane-Mitsubishi JV, which were previously announced. While it is still early days on the Trane-Mitsubishi JV, we're already seeing good returns on the ICS Cool Energy acquisition.  Please go to Slide #8. As we've highlighted, Q2 was a strong financial quarter top to bottom. We delivered 9% organic revenue growth, 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and EPS growth of 24%. Our operating leverage also significantly improved to approximately 20%.  Please go to Slide #9. Focused execution of our strategy in Operational Excellence drove strong core business operating income contribution from both of our business segments, which combined for approximately $0.25 or the majority of the $0.36 of EPS growth in the year-over-year quarter. Lower share count from significant capital deployments towards share repurchases in 2017 and 2018 drove another $0.07 improvement. We also had modest positive contributions from lower interest expense associated with the company's debt refinancing earlier this year. Additionally, we benefited from a slightly lower effective tax rate year-over-year on higher pretax earnings.  Please go to Slide #10. Strong execution drove 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter. Pricing discipline delivered greater pricing efficiency than we anticipated when we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter. Price versus material inflation improved 50 basis points sequentially in the second quarter to a positive 10 basis point spread. Higher revenue drove 80 basis points of margin expansion, and investment spend was consistent with our targeted levels of approximately 40 to 50 basis points of incremental investment per year. Productivity versus other inflation was flat in the quarter but improved sequentially. We expect productivity to continue to improve in the back half of the year and particularly in the fourth quarter as programs and initiatives continue to ramp. We expect total productivity in 2018 to exceed 2017 levels. Please go to Slide #11. Our Climate segment demonstrated strong improvement in the quarter with flat adjusted operating margins, which was a 50 basis point sequential improvement from the first quarter, driven primarily by volume, pricing and productivity. We are successfully mitigating persistent Tier 1 and Tier 2 inflation, freight costs and the known impacts of the tariffs that have been implemented to date. As you know, the majority of inflation impacts are to the Climate segment. Our China direct sales strategy continues to perform well against our expectations, with continued strong growth and improving margins as we move through the year. Please go to Slide #12. Our Industrial business delivered another strong quarter with organic revenue growth of 9%, and adjusted operating margin improvement of 170 basis points. The restructuring and productivity actions in prior years are providing operating margin growth in 2018, and we continue to take further actions in 2018 that will benefit future years.  Please go to Slide 13. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investment in high ROI projects, which is helping to drive our strong growth in both our Climate and Industrial segments this year. We have also increased our capital expenditure investments that will have strong returns through new product development and footprint optimization. We maintain a long-standing commitment to paying a strong and growing dividend and have increased the dividend at a 20% compound annual growth rate over the past 5 years. In the second quarter, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of 18%, which reflects our ongoing confidence in our ability to drive sustained high levels of cash flow in the future.  We will continue to make strategic investments in value-accretive M&A that drives long-term shareholder returns. We maintain a strong balance sheet that continues to improve through high-quality operating income growth, this provides us with significant optionality as our markets continue to evolve. We also continue to invest in share buybacks when the shares trade below our calculated intrinsic value. Over the past 1.5 years, we've spent $1.5 billion on share repurchases and have reduced our outstanding share count by approximately 5%.  Please go to Slide #15. As we touched on earlier, our strong first half financial performance gives us confidence in raising our 2018 guidance for organic revenues, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. Adjusted earnings per share guidance moves up significantly to approximately $5.50. Organic revenue guidance is more than double to a range of between 7% to 8%, reflecting very strong revenues and bookings in the first half and expectations for continued healthy end market growth and continued share gains in the second half. The strength is also broad-based.  By segment, we expect Climate and Industrial organic revenues to each be up 7% to 8%, essentially doubling our prior guidance for revenue growth for each business segment.  Please go to Slide 16. This table lays out our updated guidance versus our prior guidance in more detail. We've talked to most of the data points on the slide, so we've included the table in the presentation for your reference, and it includes some of the modeling-related questions you'll want to have. Bottom line is that we expect 2018 to be a strong year for Ingersoll Rand.  Please go to Slide #18. Moving on to our topics of interest section, we have one primary topic to cover, tariffs and inflation mitigation. The main takeaway is that we have incorporated all known direct and indirect impacts into our guidance from the section 232 tariffs and the section 301 tariffs related to the first $50 billion that went into effect in July. We're evaluating the potential impacts from the additional $200 billion in proposed Section 301 tariffs, which are indeterminate at this stage. To be clear, we have seen a significant uptick in inflation from the direct and indirect impacts of the known portions of the section 232 and 301 tariffs. At the same time, however, with the pricing effectiveness we're seeing and expectancy going forward, we believe we can maintain a flat price versus material inflation equation in the back half, as we previously guided. We expect the better pricing we are seeing to offset additional inflation and tariffs in the back half of the year. Beyond the known tariffs, we continue to closely monitor the tariff proposals and discussions taking place globally in order to react quickly if and when additional tariff pressure comes into play.  First, our global integrated supply chain team is continuously monitoring tariffs from the time they are proposed.  Second, we are rigorously addressing the cost increases across the portfolio working through our supply chain team.  And third, we are utilizing our business operating system to actively manage our pricing and productivity actions and pipeline throughout the enterprise. We anticipate that additional tariffs would be met quickly by pricing action across the industry. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks before we take Q&A. Mike? Michael Lamach : Thanks, Sue. Please go to Slide 19. We believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably. Our products and services portfolio is at the nexus of global energy efficiency and sustainability megatrends, which provides a tailwind for growth above average economic conditions over the long term. So unless you believe the world is getting less populated, cooler and less resource-constrained these secular megatrends will continue to create growth opportunities for Ingersoll Rand.  We have experienced management and a high-performing team culture that incorporates Operational Excellence into everything we do. Culture is so fundamental to a company's success, yet it is often underappreciated in the short term. For us, it is a sustainable competitive advantage that we invest in heavily to cultivate and maintain. And lastly, our business model generates powerful cash flow, and we are committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital. We have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years.  And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from UBS. Steven Winoker : Impressive performance for sure. I just wanted to come back to the -- a couple of things. One is, I guess, the order pull forward and the second one is on Climate margins. On the order pull forward from Q3, could you give us a little more color around that, and how we should expect that to materialize over kind of time frame? And do you think this is just a 1 quarter phenomenon? Or do you think there's going to be a little bit more of this? Just anything on that front would be helpful. Michael Lamach : Yes. Steve, so half of it would have been really in commercial HVAC and then a small portion would have been residential, a very small balance being TK for the most part. So that would total something in the $80 million range. What I'd say to you is that, and I don't necessarily talk about sort of third quarter, but I will say we looked at what was happening with bookings in the first few weeks of July very carefully, and they came in very strong. So I don't think that there's going to be an issue there for us with any hiccups in the quarter. Steven Winoker : Okay. That's helpful. And then on all the puts and takes around the Climate margin performance, can you give us a little more color there, too, in terms -- I know you walked through some of the price cost inflation dynamics, but -- and tariff impact and all these other items. But maybe just a sense for investment, inflation, the pricing is already out there, just something to help us think about that flat margin performance in the go-forward. Michael Lamach : Yes, I think -- sure, I think for the full year '18, Steve, the best way to think about that, the headline would be that I'd expect Climate margins to improve, say, 10, 20 basis points overall. And the pricing has been loaded in. And the productivity is something that, across the company, I always talk about the health of the pipeline. We look to make sure that 125% of what we need is in the Q. The calendarized version or the part of the perpetuity pipeline that is being worked comes down to a monthly and quarterly view. And that monthly and quarterly view would support the productivity side. So I would say with bookings where they are and the health of the end markets, with pricing, the effectivity of pricing being good, what I mean by that is the pace at which price was received and to the extent we were able to get the price that we were looking for, it's as good as I've seen. And the productivity calendarization looks good. When you net that all it out, I think you end up with 10, 20 basis point improvement for the full year implying a pretty good back half. Steven Winoker : All right, that's helpful. And I could just sneak one more in, on the Trane-Mitsubishi JV that launched, what kind of financial impact are you thinking about on that as you move forward? Michael Lamach : 2018, it's not necessarily that material to the company. And -- but the early days has been -- it's been excellent, it's been exciting and the teams are off to a great start. They're active in the market and it's performing as we would have hoped. So all systems are go and positive on that front. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Yes, can you hear me now? Michael Lamach : Got you. C. Stephen Tusa : Great. Sorry, yes -- I don't think I was on mute. So guidance implies some slowing in the Industrial margin expansion after really strong, obviously, results here. Anything going on there? Is there a mix impact or anything like that in the second half? Michael Lamach : Actually, we think Industrial remains strong. Everything is pointing forward. We're looking at probably a 2-year high now in terms of Industrial productivity. We're seeing strength across the world. We're seeing services grow at about the rate of equipment. So no, I think, for the most part, we see sort of steady as she goes in Industrial. C. Stephen Tusa : And any reason why price/cost would be -- why would price/cost decelerate in second half if kind of these price increases are going through? Is the inflation just that much worse in the second half? Michael Lamach : Well, you've got a little bit of that first $50 billion in tariffs coming through in July and August, on those 2. So I think that the safe view of that, at this point, would be the original guidance we have, which is a flat back half. We saw great price effectivity in the second quarter. It was beyond what we thought, but I think we need to pace ourselves based on the changes that happened with tariffs, and the dates of implementation and how those lists might change. But we think that we're managing it really effectively and that we've got a plan and contingencies around how to manage changes that we would get on the tariff front. By the way, it's not just tariffs, it's inflation. We really have a region-for-region strategy. And so if you think about the impact we're seeing, it's not so much on the actual tariff, it's on the derivative effect of commodities in the region increasing because they can as a result of tariffs. C. Stephen Tusa : Got it. One last quick one on resi. What do you think the market -- I mean, Lennox was up 9, Carrier was mid-single digits. So it's -- the market is kind of all over the place a little bit here. What do you think the market is going to kind of shake out after the second quarter for resi? Michael Lamach : Yes, I think the market data was released already, Steve, so we grew share in the quarter. We know that. And If you look across the board, and I know you'd love the detail on this, but let me just tell you that on the Climate segment itself, when you think about the revenue growth rate for the segment, we didn't have more than 1 point of variance globally across HVAC or transport or residential. So it was a really good uniform performance. And then North America specifically, when you look at applied unitary and service, everything there was, say, 15%, 16% plus growth. And so that was really strong across the whole range which probably tells you what you're asking, I think, at that point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Mike, just a little bit more color on price. I think earlier in the year, there was a lot of optimism you could get it in the U.S. but a lot of doubt or certainly less certainty about rest of the world. Your results here do suggest that price is moving up pretty nicely now in those markets, but could you give a little bit more color on kind of the geographic differences around price? And if you're maybe still playing a bit more catch up outside of the U.S.? Michael Lamach : There is not a lot of variability around price effectivity around the globe for us at this point, Jeff. And that's part of, if you will, the surprise here. So the margin improvement in China is going really well, and that would've been the points we would have been talking about a couple of quarters ago. But that's going really well and there's not enough differentiation globally to really kind of point out here in that space. Now I mean clearly, we are covering and have been covering material inflation in every business, with the exception of our global commercial HVAC business, and what we're seeing there is that, that gap is flattening and improving with the increases that have been put out in the marketplace. Jeffrey Sprague : And how about capacity, Mike? In a good news result in a year like this, I would assume you're sweating the assets a little harder than you thought. Any material change in investment or anything that you need to do to keep up with this? Michael Lamach : Jeff, we're ready to build and ship more, so send us orders and we'll get it to you. Yes, no, it's a good time, and we need to make hay when the sun's shine. We all understand that and that's what's happening. So we don't have any capacity issues at this point in time. Jeffrey Sprague : I'm sorry, just one other quick one, maybe Sue has calculated this number. But if you're at price/cost parity, how much margin pressure, just arithmetically, does that create? Susan Carter : I'm not sure I -- I'm not sure I understand. Jeffrey Sprague : Well, revenues will be higher because of price but profits not up because you're neutralizing cost with price. So there's an arithmetic margin headwind. If you haven't done the math or you don't know it, that's fine. Just curious. Susan Carter : Yes, I haven't done the math. But what I would say, Jeff, is when we think about this through the entire P&L is we're not just working off of that equation, we're working off of all the different elements. And so as we point out to you on productivity, we're continuing to put productivity projects into the pipeline because there are other elements that are inflationary and moving around in the P&L, too. So we can certainly come back to you on that answer. But my general overall answer is, I'm going to manage everything that is on the P&L to get to the guidance that we've provided and that we're going to hit for 2018. Michael Lamach : Jeff, a good example here is that it's one of the better gross productivity years, if not the best, in terms of the absolute dollars that we've ever had. So although the bridge shows that to be flat, that's absorbing 20 basis points of freight in that equation, as an example, that would haven't been planned, which will show up a bit in price. So this stuff, to Sue's point, is moving around between price and productivity, and it improves in the back half of the year. But to get to the arithmetic math -- the arithmetic equation there, we'll follow up with you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, obviously your intention in China has been to accelerate growth through moving to the direct sales model, and you did mention that one of the highlights of your overall growth this quarter is China HVAC. Can you give us a little bit more perspective on the growth in the region, maybe how much of it is coming from your own initiative here versus what the HVAC market is doing over there? Michael Lamach : Yes. The market is growing something in the 5% range, so we're growing in multiples of the market there. And it's in the areas that we would expect, which is the applied systems and some of the larger infrastructure projects and in some of the geographies that we weren't covering as deeply as in the past. So that is a strategy, that's what's being executed. It's being executed very well, and the margin profile and linkage to service continues to improve. So it's been a great success. It's probably one of the greatest successes we've had in the past year or so has been that whole strategy, and I would continue -- I would expect that to continue. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. And you don't adjust and tweak that strategy given all of the tariff stuff that's going on between us and China, correct? Michael Lamach : Well same equation in China applies here. We build about 95% of what we sell in China in China and the supply chain is localized. So yes, it's the same equation as we have here region-in-region. Andrew Kaplowitz : Got it. And then -- look, you delivered almost 9% organic revenue growth across the first half of '18. You mentioned the 15% bookings tailwind, maybe a little bit of pull forward as you talked about, but it's not affecting 3Q. So the implied organic growth for the second half, let's call it 6% to 7%, is that just conservatism at the midpoint? Or is there anything that you would worry could slow down the second half? Or is it just sort of steady as she goes? Michael Lamach : Well, some of the bigger growers in the quarter would have been applied and it would have been compression technologies equipment. So in essence, we're building to 2019 as we speak. And I would say a lot of that is our view toward building a profile for '19. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Just wanted to circle back on the Industrial segment, if you could give any color within compressors, any specific markets or regions that you thought gave the orders a particular lift? And also on the Industrial segment in general, following up on an earlier question, I mean, the margin guide implies sort of flat margins, I think, sequentially in the second half, which is quite unusual in Industrial, particularly given the sales trends. So I don't know if there is any extra color you could give on why that's the case? Michael Lamach : Yes, in terms of the market, we called out Asia specifically, and that's true, it was really across all of the oil-free technologies, which would be centrifugal and oil-free rotary combined, but also strength in some of the quick ship or the quick book and turn business, short-cycle compressors were strong as well. Service growth across the board is really stepping up. That team has done an outstanding job of taking the operating system for sales excellence and really putting that into how they manage for daily improvement. And so the coverage of the market, the activity we're seeing through that coverage in the market is much stronger than we've seen in the past. Well, that's part of the playbook that we actually stole from the HVAC China business, if you will, in terms of how we're thinking about covering the market more fully and differently there. So -- but North America was good. It was strong as well. We saw that in Contact Cooled, it's a technology. We see that implant there. Centrifugal sort of going into general industry, that's been good as well. Julian Mitchell : Understood. And then just on the margins sort of half-on-half in Industrial. Is there anything particularly weighing on that, that back half in terms of higher investments? Or at this point, you think you've raised the margin guide enough for now, and we'll just see how Q3 plays out? Michael Lamach : No. We wouldn't do that, if we thought it was better we'd rolled that through, but that's the roll-off we've got at this point in time, and [ certainly ] that's going to be a combination of mix and timing of projects. So I think it's a good forecast where we think the year is going to end at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Maybe just to clarify Jeff's question from earlier, when you guys made the comment around margin parity -- price/cost parity in the second half of the year, you were talking about margins, not on a dollar basis, right? Michael Lamach : Somewhat margins, right. Susan Carter : Yes. Michael Lamach : Absolutely. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. Got it, got it. Yes, I think that, that probably clarifies it. Maybe talking about the growth that you're seeing specifically on Climate and into 2019, Mike, can you provide maybe some color on some of the orders that you're booking that could potentially be longer cycle that could start benefiting '19 as well? Michael Lamach : Yes. I mean, we're seeing, again, there's very little variability between unitary, applied, controls and service. It's just a strong healthy global environment for us, really all regions of the world. There were no large performance contracts in there and something that would skew the results. That's really important to know. So because you're seeing such strength in applied, you're generally finding longer lead projects. And so if anything there, again, you're building quarter 1, quarter 2 of '19 backlog, which we're already well into that based on customer timing. Joseph Ritchie : Cool. That's good to hear. And then I guess my follow-up there is really just price/cost is better than we expected this quarter. I was just wondering, did you benefit at all from like the pullback that we started to see in copper? And then what are kind of like your assumptions for the key commodities into the second half of the year? Michael Lamach : Well, really, it's the best price effectivity I've seen in 33 years of going through this, both in the urgency to get it done and in the ability to maximize what it was that we were asking for. So the combination of that got us a bit ahead of the curve, which is great, further along than we thought we'd be in Q2. And then the ability to absorb the first $50 billion into the pricing that we put out in the marketplace would be the success there. As it relates to copper specifically, we ladder and hedge, and so yes, it's great that things are moving down. But as you kind of enter quarter 3 and the back half of the year, a smaller percentage of the spend is really in the spot market, we begin to lock that in. So if it continues, we'll see some benefit, but that would be reflected in the locks that we would be doing going into 2019 at this point. Susan Carter : Yes. I think that's right, Joe. When we think about that, the goal that I would have is to get ourselves to the point where, in 2019, that, that blended rate gets through our locks and that sort of dollar cost averaging that we're doing on a copper buy comes down overall. So we never lock, as we've told you, to the full amount of the commodity, 75% at the beginning of a quarter. So we do get some benefits on any purchase that we're going to make from those prices coming down. But I would look at that as more of an opportunity for 2019 as we go forward. So it's always good because we are always buying all 3 of the commodities. So we'll certainly take advantage of any price drops that we get. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Obviously, you've covered a lot of ground here, and you've provided good details, so I haven't got a huge amount here, but I'm actually pretty paranoid about the sustainability of the strength and obviously 15% growth is not going to sustain. But as you look beyond July and look at the front logs, RFP activity, customer conversations, what do you think you see in the next 6 months or so? Are we still looking at a double-digit type order cadence here? I mean, any cause of concern? Any color there would be very helpful. Michael Lamach : Yes, I mean, globally, as we tracked proposal activity, and we look at what's happening in the market, Nigel, things are strong all over the world for us. And it fundamentally comes down to, in most parts of the world, it's a replacement business, 80%, 85% of most -- what we're seeing in North America, Europe, for sure, and the Middle East is going to be replacement business, and even China. And some of the newer economies are 50/50 in terms of replacement/new construction. And so what's happening is when you can build an equation that has economic value and a payback related to energy productivity, energy efficiency. And if we're able to couple that with a story that helps customers achieve their greenhouse gas emission or sustainability goals, there is a demand creation opportunity out there that's really not factored into how people might look at particular put-in-place or market data across the globe. So it truly is a secular tailwind tied to this whole nexus of energy efficiency and sustainability. And I think that, that's a long-lived phenomenon. You heard me in my opening and close that really relates to the fact that I think as you see more urbanization, you see more pressure on energy and the environment and you think about what businesses we're in, where HVAC is such a major contributor to building efficiency and to greenhouse gas emissions, followed by transport and refrigeration, followed by industrial processes, we're in the right businesses to have an impact. And so I think that's a big part of it. The product portfolio, the investments in controls and digital, the investments in the channel really just go to support that model that we think is the right model. Nigel Coe : That's great color. And then just on the service trends, we don't typically see service grow in high single digits. And I know that a lot of that is due to your internal initiatives around connectivity, et cetera. And just obviously a lot of investments there as well. But is there any signal here that's -- we've seen utilization picking up particularly on the Industrial side? And is there some sense here that we've got some aged equipment out there which will require [ more and more ] activity and then perhaps that could signal further activity on OE side? Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, services was actually mid-teens. And it's so unusual to see when equipment grows mid-teens, you've got services growing mid-teens. But it really comes down to the whole sales excellence work being conducted across the company and that bearing fruit really over time. And even parts of the world, historically, places like China where I can imagine in the next 3 to 5 years you seeing the same sorts of linkage parity that you're finding in Western Europe and in the U.S. And so that is certainly impacting service growth. Rental is another one. We think that's an important part of the strategy to be able to backstop customers' uptime requirements as well as an opportunity to provide seasonal equipment and to create service opportunities through the rental business, and so that's helping us in that regard as well. As far as Industrial -- you might want to just ask us the second part of your question, the point you were interested in, I think it was industrial productivity? Nigel Coe : Just -- no, more on the industrial compressors, whether we're seeing increased utilization of those machines driving service or is this more internal IR? Michael Lamach : Well, you're definitely seeing utilization rates across most of the economies in the world increasing up to critical points where you are finding expansion opportunities. So to me, what's really happening in the Compression Technologies business is the market coverage we're taking on and the investments we're making in covering the service opportunities in the markets has taken on a whole different sense of urgency. That connectivity strategy that Todd talked about for really a couple of years at this point in time is something that's showing up in the results in a meaningful way. Nigel Coe : And then it's a quick one, Mike, on mix in residential. 1 or 2 of your competitors talked about a slight negative mix in U.S. resi, did you see that at all in your business? Michael Lamach : No. Not at all. Simple answer, no. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo. Richard Kwas : Mike, on the performance contracting project. So nothing this quarter. Earlier in the year, you said some things could hit, but at this point, is it fair to say that's all going to come in '19? Michael Lamach : No. I think that we could see Q3, Q4. I think these are -- sort of landing gear is down on a couple of these. So I think that quarter 3, quarter 4 would be my guess. Richard Kwas : And would those have some sort of mix down impact on -- and be enough to have a mix -- negative mix impact on Climate on the margin side? Michael Lamach : No, no, it wouldn't. The contribution there is going to be just fine. In gross margins, you'll see a little bit, but the contributions will be accretive. Richard Kwas : And institutional orders consistent with overall Climate orders growth organic-wise? Michael Lamach : Yes. I mean, really you're seeing applied, which I would link to Institutional growing at the same rate as unitary, growing at the same rate as service. Richard Kwas : Okay. And then two, just a question on M&A contribution. Earlier in the year, you had $0.05 or $0.06 from deals done in '17 in terms of the EPS contribution for '18 and then something like $0.15, $0.16 for '19. Are those numbers coming in better? Susan Carter : Well, so what you did see, as we look at the M&A activity that has impacted cash flow in the first half, so $286 million. That is the announcement that -- or the committed transactions, the ICS Cool Energy as well as Mitsubishi that we had committed at year-end. But I think one of the things that I would do, Rich, just as you think about this is, I'll step you back to almost a capital allocation and sort of broaden out your question, which, as we think about capital allocation, we think about investing in the business, first, having a strong dividend, second, and then having the remainder split off between M&A and share buyback if the stock is trading below its intrinsic value. If you look at the first half of the 2018 and I follow that along, so we've got heavier CapEx in 2018 related to some of the footprint optimization as well as the new product development that I talked about in the prepared remarks. So that's actually $163 million. We've got the dividends that we talked about of $222 million. We've also got the share buyback of $500 million and the M&A of $286 million. So in the first half of the year, we've actually deployed over $1 billion of the excess cash that we've got. And so M&A is a part of it. We're going to continue to look at the pipeline, but I just wanted to take the opportunity to point out how strong the capital allocation has really been in the first half. Michael Lamach : Rich, specifically on the deals done, they're integrating well, and we're achieving what we thought we would achieve, which had a high threshold. So I don't think any changes with the guidance we gave you around '18 and '19 around contribution. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann from Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Maybe a couple quick philosophical things, if I could. First, on Thermo King. Based on the data we see, it doesn't really look like the fleets of trucks and trailers are actually growing that much, which would suggest that what we're seeing here is kind of a technology upgrade, and I know there's much better energy efficiency with the more recent units. But how long do you think that can last? I mean, where are we in the process of upgrading the fleet, do you think? Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, from a U.S. perspective first, you've got tight shipping capacity, you've got regulatory changes, you've got the impact from U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, immediate expensing, all that's going to drive some opportunity. You are right, I mean, technology is a major difference. If you think about what's going across the road in a refrigerated trailer, really any Class A tractor, the need to manage the diesel engine and reduce fuel consumption to manage the refrigeration cycle, the energy and any greenhouse gas emissions coming off those units and to supplement that with auxiliary power units when the vehicles are idling, it's a big opportunity that I think continues for a long period of time. I mean, ultimately like you're seeing with vehicles -- consumer vehicles, you're going to see more electrification of that over time. And that certainly, what we're doing now with some of the hybrid applications as well as the telematics investments that we've made across the portfolio. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. That's helpful. And then even maybe a little more broad picture. At some point, I suppose all these price increases, we should start to worry about some demand destruction in certain end markets. And some of the pricing we're hearing, especially in the HVAC, is pretty impressive. And I guess I'm just curious how you think about when that starts to crimp growth or maybe it doesn't, I don't know, maybe these markets are consolidated enough now. But I'm curious how you think about that and how you might even sort of a measure and monitor it. Michael Lamach : Well history would say that it doesn't happen, that there isn't a destruction over time. And so I rely a lot on history, and I would also rely on a lot of the discipline that happens within the industries themselves. And so the structure of the industry is something we do look at, but we're not seeing any changes to historical patterns here. Operator : Our next question comes from Joel Tiss from BMO. Joel Tiss : I just had 1 or 2 little ones. Can you break out the bookings in Industrial by the different product lines just because there's been a couple of questions around the edges of that? I think that would just clear a lot of things up. Michael Lamach : Joel, Club Car was the weakest, just marginally negative and the strongest would have been CTS and material handling, albeit material handling being a smaller business. But CTS would have been additive, Club Car would have been dilutive and power and fluid management right in the hunt there. So that's the rundown there. Joel Tiss : So you won't give us numbers. All right. And then -- and can you talk a little bit about... Michael Lamach : I probably gave you enough of the algebra there that a smart guy like you, Joel, can handle that. Joel Tiss : Once I run out of fingers, I'm done. And can you just give us a little sense on the second half share repurchases that are baked into the guidance? And also, are there any larger acquisitions that, over the next 18 months, like you can fuzz it up a little bit, but just a little color on anything bigger that might be percolating? Michael Lamach : Well, let me do the second part first, Sue can tell you about share buyback. But on the first part, nothing has changed with regard to our methodology, the discipline about how we're thinking about M&A. I think about 80% of what we look at in M&A are assets that we know and think fit the portfolio. 20% are always a good idea that come in from additional sources that get evaluated to see if we're missing something or there's a fit. So nothing has changed there with regard to how we look at the pipeline, how we manage it, how we think about it strategically or how we compare that to other alternatives, including share buyback. And Sue, you may want to comment on share buyback? Susan Carter : Yes, on the share buyback, the way that we modeled this, Joel, for purposes of the guidance is absolutely consistent with where we started out the year. So we put a placeholder in for $500 million, which, as you know, we've completed. But that isn't the capital allocation strategy. The capital allocation strategy says we're looking to deploy the excess cash and that we're going to look at the M&A pipeline as well as more share buyback to absolutely finish out the capital deployment for the year. So the model today with the guidance is consistent with where we started out the year with the $500 million. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Andrew Krill : This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. So going back to the trucking and freight shortage and issues, I think, one of your competitors noted they had a pretty -- a meaningful impact in June for resi HVAC. So I just wanted -- did you guys see any of that? And can you just update us on how the costs in freight and shipping are tracking year-over-year? I think you said around 15% up previously? Michael Lamach : No, I said actually refrigerated freight mile is up about 30%, which is great for our TK business, and we were seeing dry freight, at that time, up in the market about 15%. I didn't actually say what our rate increases were. I did say earlier on the call though that there's a 20 basis point impact in the productivity/other inflation bridge that we've got. So if you take that bridge, which shows flat, there's a 20 basis point headwind associated with freight in that number. So that's the impact that we're seeing. And by the way, a lot of the [indiscernible] -- Andrew, and lot of the productivity initiatives, not a lot, but a number of productivity initiatives in the third and fourth quarter are looking at ideas that we've got around freight and warehousing. And so that's sort of an exciting thing that we're thinking about. We started that about a year ago. It's a bit fortunate, if you will, that we've got that kind of teed in for the Q3, Q4 this year, so that should help with that equation dramatically. Andrew Krill : Got it. And then on the resi, did you have any impact on just shortage of being able to ship resi units in this quarter or maybe in 3Q so far? Michael Lamach : No. We'll ship all you want. Again, send us your orders. We're happy to do that, and we've got no problem building them and shipping them. Andrew Krill : Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up on the [indiscernible] China HVAC strategic just -- with all the tariffs and, say, [ rounds ] in U.S. and China, have you seen any kind of blowback against the U.S. brands in general? Or is the value proposition still that they really don't care at this point? Michael Lamach : Well, we employ a lot of people in China. We've got factories and technology and product built for the market. And so in China, we think of ourselves as a Chinese company. In the U.S., we think about ourselves about -- as a U.S. company. Fundamentally we're a global company, and we've got to act that way in the markets that we serve. So to your question specifically, no. We haven't seen any reaction to that one way or the other. Operator : Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. David Raso : On the organic sales guidance increase, the 3.25% to 7.5%, how much of that was higher price than you previously assumed? Michael Lamach : I have to think about that. There really was a second price increase which would have happened, depending on the business, kind of midway through the year. So we wouldn't have had a lot in there for -- meaningfully on this. Certainly, it would have looked at material inflation and news around freight, 232 and 301, and we're trying to get on top of that as it was happening. So David, we'd probably have to come back and answer that. But it's not something meaningfully popping out on the bridge to say that, that is such a difference that -- from where we were originally. Susan Carter : No. Because -- David, the way that I would think about that is with the pricing and generally your -- again your pricing realization in the neighborhood of 1% to 2% is going to kind of flow through. So it might move the growth slightly, but it's not going to be the biggest factor in changing the growth. It's really coming out of the volume that's occurring out of the end markets as opposed to pricing or FX or acquisitions, which basically are having about the same impact as the original guidance. Michael Lamach : David, I'd probably say maybe 1 point to 120 basis points for the full year would be price. Everything else is going to be pretty well volume. David Raso : So that's not all new pricing from the previous guidance, right? That's full year, what you had said? Michael Lamach : That's all. That's right. David Raso : I mean, the reason I ask is when you look at the segments, and I don't know if it's conservatism or, as you said, a lot of the inflation is in Climate, but you just raised your revenue guidance for Climate $475 million, but you only raised the EBIT $46 million, right? So basically a 9.7% incremental profit on the incremental sales you're now looking for. And that sort of begs the question, are we really saying price versus cost maintains the margin? Or price of $100 offsets cost of $100? So just to be clear, we're saying price/cost does not erode the margin the rest of the year, especially in Climate? Or is it, no, it's $100 of cost get offset by $100 of price and yes, that does dampen the margin, but at least we're offsetting it in dollar terms? Just the incremental margin on Climate just seems low on what you just raised the sales by. Susan Carter : But I'm thinking out loud, David, as we go through this. But I think what you have to do with all of this is you can't just parse out a couple of pieces. And it really is important to understand that the majority of the big inflationary items are occurring in the Climate segment of the business and that as we're looking at the Climate segment itself over the second quarter, you're actually seeing an improvement in the overall margins for the quarter. So we're offsetting the headwinds and continuing to improve margins in the business. Michael Lamach : David, I guess, our math is a little bit different, too, by the way. I mean, to get to a 10, 20 basis point expansion in Climate for the full year, we're going to have to get something like 50, 60 basis points of improvement in the back half of the year. That implied leverage organically of somewhere between, let's say, 23% and 25%. So we'll [indiscernible] David Raso : Is the incremental margin year-over-year -- it is 23%, but I'm talking about literally what you just raised in sales and EBIT. What you would think there was incremental -- that's why I asked the pricing question. If it was simple like I raised revenue in Climate by, you name it, the $475 million but half of it was price and all I'm doing is offsetting cost, then I can appreciate why the incremental profit on that sale is modest, right? We're just trying to understand is there conservatism in that number? Or when you look at Industrial, that same math on the way you raised the sales $114 million, you are dropping through 36% more profits. So is the messaging here that, yes, the inflation is in Climate, that price/cost might be a drag on margin, but we're more than making up for it in Industrial, and thus the whole company has price/cost, no margin drag. It seems that you're trying to figure out. Michael Lamach : High level, David, I'd say that, and Sue said, the 232s and 301s really hit the Climate segment much more, if not almost exclusively, with the Industrial business. And so to my mind, you've got more headwind there to offset. There is more price in the back half obviously than there would be in the first half. You've got direct material inflation, which continues in the second half to be a bit larger than the first half. But sure enough, the math for the mid -- showing up -- shoring up the math to the raise, we can work with you later on and kind of compare notes. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call over to Zac Nagle for closing comments. Zac Nagle : Great, I'd like to thank everyone for joining for today's call. And wanted to let you know that we'll all -- we'll be around for questions today, tomorrow, this next week and the coming weeks, and we look forward to seeing you on the road in the coming weeks as well. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call, and you may now disconnect.",

Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Please go to Slide 3. I'd like to begin with a brief review of the fundamental elements of our business strategy that underpin our quarterly results and create value for our shareholders.  First, our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource-constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity of buildings and industrial processes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Our business portfolio creates a platform for the company to consistently grow above-average global economic conditions, aided by the strong secular tailwinds I've outlined. Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at consistently delivering strong top line growth, incremental margins and free cash flow. And lastly, over the years, we built an experienced management team and a high-performance winning culture that makes our performance sustainable. And combined with our dynamic capital allocation strategy, we have a differentiated business model that drives strong shareholder returns over the long term. Moving to Slide 4. Exiting Q3 and moving into Q4, we continue to execute well and are on track to exceed the guidance we outlined for investors on our Q2 earnings call. First, our end markets remain healthy, and we have continued to deliver excellent growth in bookings and revenues in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Additionally, our growth continues to be broad-based across virtually all businesses, products and geographies globally, and services growth continues to be especially strong. Second, our leverage and profitability are improving as we are effectively managing all elements of the P&L to deliver results. In the third quarter, we achieved our second half 2018 leverage target of approximately 25% through strong volume and effective management of our price versus material cost and productivity versus other inflation metrics. We saw good margin expansion across the business, led by the Industrial segment and healthy margin expansion in our Commercial and Residential HVAC businesses. The second half of the year has become increasingly inflationary since we updated our guidance in July. We are embedding the impacts of additional material and other inflation, tariffs, the knock-on effects of tariffs into our forecast. In spite of this impact, we expect to continue to effectively manage these costs as we have in the second and third quarters and to maintain our guidance of approximately 25% leverage for the fourth quarter. We have raised our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $5.55 and $5.60, up from approximately $5.50 for fiscal 2018. In October, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion, bringing our total available authorization to approximately $1.9 billion. This reflects continued confidence in our ability to generate strong free cash flows going forward and gives us increased capacity as we execute our dynamic capital allocation strategy. 2018 is shaping up to be another strong year for us. As we move through the fourth quarter, visibility into 2019 is also improving. Based on virtually everything we're seeing, our major end markets look poised for another year of good growth. Strong bookings in 2018 are also setting us up with a solid backlog picture heading into 2019. And finally, we're managing material and other inflation and tariffs, enabling us to drive solid leverage through the P&L and further expand margins. We expect to use the same processes and tools in our business operating system to manage these risks in 2019. In summary, we're executing our strategy well and this is enabling us to deliver differentiated performance in 2018. The second half is progressing consistent with our expectations and we plan to close out the year in a strong note.  Looking forward to 2019, we're expecting another good year for our industry and particularly for Ingersoll Rand. Please go to Slide #5. The third quarter was highlighted by continued strong growth across the board as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. Enterprise organic bookings and revenues were both up double digits. Climate led the way with organic bookings and revenues of 12% and 10%, respectively. Industrial was also robust with organic bookings and revenues up 7% and 9%, respectively. These results reflect continued strong execution of our business strategy, capitalizing on healthy end markets. The one minus on the chart was a bookings decline in Commercial HVAC in the Middle East, where orders can be lumpy and there were a couple of large orders in the third quarter of 2017 that did not repeat in 2018. European HVAC orders continued to be strong in the quarter. Let's go to Slide #6. The next 2 slides provide insights and additional color into the key drivers behind the chart on Slide 5 and how we're thinking about the markets for the remainder of the year and into next year. In Commercial HVAC, we're seeing sustained growth globally in both bookings and revenues with good growth in both services and equipment. North America growth was strong with continued gains in services, contracting, controls and equipment. Institutional growth was particularly strong, led by the education markets. As we discussed on Slide 5, Europe Commercial HVAC remained strong with solid growth across the board in both services and equipment. China HVAC growth continues to outpace the market. Weakening economic indicators in China did not appear to be impacting the HVAC markets to date. Other markets in Asia continued to be mixed, as they have been all year. Our outlook for global commercial HVAC remains healthy and key economic and market indicators largely support our view with increasing visibility into 2019. Turning to Residential HVAC. Bookings and revenue growth continued to be strong. Replacement markets, where the majority of our sales are derived, should continue strong growth in the quarter and this is expected to continue through the remainder of 2018 into 2019. Please go to Slide #7. Our Transport Solutions business continues to be globally diversified and resilient. We've seen good order growth for North America trailers in 2018 and the estimates for market revenues has improved from the beginning of the year as well. The Americas Commercial Transportation Research Co., also known as ACT, has taken their forecast for North American refrigerated trailer shipments to 43,700 units, which represents approximately 3% growth over 2017. Our capacity to ship refrigeration units exceeds the industry capacity to supply trailers, so we should have solid backlog heading into 2019. Auxiliary power unit growth was strong in both refrigerated and non-refrigerated segments. As with North American trailers, backlog will be strong going into 2019 as well. Overall, the transport markets remain healthy in 2018 and we expect this to continue heading into 2019. Compression Technologies growth has been solid, consistent with industrial production and other key leading indicators. In quarter 3, we delivered good growth in bookings and revenues in both aftermarket and equipment, with particular strength in China. We are seeing some signs of pause with our large Chinese exporter customers as U.S.-China trade negotiations continue and China economic indicators weaken, but it's too early to call what impact this will ultimately have but we're continuing to monitor the situation carefully. Overall, we expect to see solid growth broadly across key products, services and markets through the year-end and into next year, while maintaining optimism that the U.S.-China trade negotiations will come to a favorable resolution. Small electric vehicle bookings and revenue growth were strong, driven largely by continued success of our consumer vehicle. We're also seeing strong growth across our high-margin Industrial Fluid Management, Tools and Material Handling businesses. Now I'd like to turn over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue? Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #8. As Mike highlighted, Q3 was another strong quarter for us with continued robust bookings and revenue growth, improved leverage, solid margin expansion in both our business segments and 22% year-over-year adjusted continuing earnings per share growth. The third quarter was right in line with our expectations regarding how the second half would play out when we provided our updated guidance on our Q2 earnings call, which gives us confidence we'll continue the trend and achieve that guidance with $0.05 to $0.10 of upside on the EPS line or a revised adjusted earnings per share range of $5.55 to $5.60, up from approximately $5.50. Looking at our third quarter results in more detail. Bookings and revenue performance remained strong with sustained growth in virtually every major product category and geography. Services was, once again, a standout with 11% growth, outpacing 9% equipment growth as we continue to focus on our growing mix of stable, high-margin recurring revenue streams. We continue to target free cash flow equal to 100% of adjusted net income for 2018. Year-to-date, we've been able to sustain very high levels of revenue growth across the business at 9% organic for the enterprise.  We've been able to maintain this growth, in part, because we've appropriately raised our inventory levels to keep up with the robust demand for our products and to meet the needs of our customers. As a result, we're sitting at a higher working capital level at just over 5% of revenue. This is consistent with 2017, and we expect this to improve as we return to a more natural 3% to 4% level for us in the fourth quarter. We maintain our commitment to a dynamic and balanced capital allocation strategy and to returning 100% of excess cash to shareholders over time, whether it be through our strong and growing dividend or through share repurchases as we've consistently demonstrated over many years or through value-accretive M&A. Through September, we have returned over $850 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In October, our Board of Directors also authorized an additional $1.5 billion share repurchase program, bringing our total available share repurchase authorization to $1.9 billion, demonstrating our commitment to share repurchases as an important element of our capital deployment strategy and giving us good flexibility on how and when we execute the program. We also continue to have a healthy and accretive acquisition pipeline that present opportunities for value-accretive M&A. Our year-to-date spend is approximately $280 million. This spend is primarily related to the ICS Cool Energy acquisition and the Trane-Mitsubishi JV. Both acquisitions are performing well and ahead of our initial value-creation models. Please go to Slide #9. As we've discussed, Q3 was a strong financial quarter top to bottom. At the enterprise level, we delivered 10% organic revenue growth, 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement and adjusted continuing earnings per share growth of 22%. Importantly, we also achieved operating leverage of approximately 25%, which is improvement versus our leverage of approximately 19% in the second quarter and consistent with our guidance for the second half of 2018, as we continue to manage through increasing inflation, new tariffs and other inflation in areas such as freight and wages. Please go to Slide #10. Focused execution of our strategy in Operational Excellence drove strong core business operating income contribution in both of our business segments, which combined for approximately $0.28 or virtually all the earnings per share growth in the quarter. The quality of earnings for Ingersoll Rand remained high and that we had a very clean quarter with strong results across the board. Please go to Slide #11. Strong execution drove 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter. Price versus material inflation was positive by 10 basis points. Productivity versus other inflation was flat. We're effectively managing tariffs, material cost increases and other inflationary impacts consistent with our guidance for the second half of 2018. Please go to Slide #12. Our Climate segment delivered a very strong third quarter, with 10% organic revenue growth and 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. Results were strong across the board, consistent with our expectations. Please go to Slide #13. Our Industrial business also delivered very strong results with 9% organic revenue growth and 190 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. Similar to Climate, the strength in the business was broad-based and it was a very clean quarter. We continue to see strong leverage in our Industrial segment driven by commercial improvements, restructuring returns and productivity improvements. Please go to Slide 14. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments and high ROI projects, which is helping to drive our strong growth in both our Climate and Industrial segments this year. As we've discussed on prior calls, in 2018, we have also increased our capital expenditure investments primarily related to a number of footprint optimization initiatives and new product development projects. These investments will help us make a more cost-efficient and resilient business. We maintained a strong balance sheet with significant optionality as our markets continued to evolve. We maintained our long-standing commitment to paying a strong and growing dividend at or above net income growth. We continue to invest in share buybacks when the shares trade below our calculated intrinsic value. And as noted earlier, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion in October to a total available authorization of approximately $1.9 billion. Year-to-date through Q3, we returned over $850 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Please go to Slide 16. One of the main topics of interest is how we are managing tariffs and inflation. We've discussed this topic a fair amount throughout our remarks, so I won't spend a lot of additional time on the topic here. This slide gives a good summary of how we are managing all of the associated cost risks, so we've included it in the presentation for your reference. Please go to Slide 17. A second topic of interest is our visibility into 2019. As Mike highlighted earlier in the presentation, as we move into the fourth quarter, our visibility into 2019 is improving. We expect to continue to have healthy end markets, and our business portfolio creates a platform for the company to consistently grow above-average global economic condition aided by strong secular tailwinds. Strong bookings in 2018 should also set us up with solid backlog headed into 2019. We're factoring in the expected impacts from inflation and tariffs into our planning process for 2019, and our objective is to effectively manage these impacts by managing the whole P&L to drive solid leverage as we've done in 2018. We plan to provide full 2019 guidance when we hold our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call in late January. The last topic is restructuring. We have updated our full year 2018 guidance for restructuring cost to $0.28, up from $0.20 reflecting recently announced initiatives related to the company's ongoing footprint optimization, which drives operational efficiencies and reduces cost. Until these footprint optimization initiatives were announced, it would have been premature to include them in our estimates. Now I would like to turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks. Mike? Michael Lamach : Thanks, Sue, and please go to Slide 18. We believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably. Our products and services portfolio is at the nexus of global energy efficiency and sustainability megatrends, which provides a tailwind for growth, above-average economic conditions over the long term. Unless you believe the world is getting less populated, cooler and less resource-constrained, these secular megatrends will continue to create growth opportunities for Ingersoll Rand. We have an experienced management team and a high-performing team culture that incorporates Operational Excellence into everything we do. Our business operating system and our culture are a differentiated and sustainable competitive advantage. And lastly, our business model generates powerful cash flow and we are committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital. We have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : I was wondering if you would help us out a little bit more with tariffs. I understand that it's included in your guidance, but specifically thinking about this list 3 at 10%. Can you give us some idea of what kind of headwind you are overcoming there? And obviously, the follow-on thought, obviously, is then you're going to think about what that means if we do go to this 25% and how you take actions against that. Michael Lamach : We showed everything we know on list 1, 2 and 3 and 232 combined, would have been a headwind for 2018 of around, say, $30 million, probably a little bit less than $30 million, but close to $30 million. And in 2019, it would be an incremental, say, $80 million. And our view toward that has always been we're going to cover material cost with price. We're going to cover productivity, productivity over other inflation. So we did that in Q2. We did it in Q3. We think it's flat in Q4. Price is still building through the system, and you're seeing that and we'll see it through any of the engineered systems that we produce in the company, whether it's HVAC or air compressors into 2019. So I feel like we've got a handle on it, managing the impact of that. Handle that with the strategies that we've had, historically, in the company over the last few years. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And then, separately, there's been a lot of talk about consolidation and the like in the industry. I just wondered if you could update us on your thoughts on what your priorities are whether you think the market's ripe for such a move and what exactly you'd be looking for. Michael Lamach : Our views haven't changed over the last few years, which would be fundamentally at the heart of that. We're in great shape strategically. We don't need to do anything. So anything that we would do, we need to be very compelling from a shareholder's point of view. Having said that, we played all the game theory that's imaginable on this and clearly know sort of what would make sense for us competitively and how we'd react to all of the above. So on that, there's really nothing more to kind of add on that at this point in time. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Just wanted to follow up on Jeff's question just so we kind of level set ourselves. I guess this year, when all is said and done, your kind of price material inflation equation is, I guess, kind of like modestly negative here for -- in total. Negative 40 bps in the first quarter and then kind of flattish for the rest of the year. Is that correct for the year? Michael Lamach : Yes. Fundamentally, it was flat for the back half of the year. That's where we think we're going to track as flat to the back half of the year. C. Stephen Tusa : Yes. So I guess, just thinking about that $30 million from tariffs alone, there was obviously some pretty substantial just base inflation that you guys are covering with what, like 1.5% of price this year, something like that? Michael Lamach : Roughly. C. Stephen Tusa : So that -- yes. So we should think about that $80 million in the context of what was in total inflation. Obviously, a much bigger number than the $30 million of just the tariff-related stuff in 2018, and arguably maybe that stuff is not as kind of severe on a year-over-year basis in 2019. Is that the correct way to look at it? Michael Lamach : It is, Steve. I think, again, the pricing that we've put in is what contemplated all of this. If anything has changed, it's been a little bit more around some of the retaliatory approach that China has taken to some of the U.S. imports. I think we've got a strategy to deal with all of that within the planning process. If we had perfect information on input costs for 2019 or if cost didn't change from this point in time, we would target the same 20, 30 basis points of margin expansion price over material inflation that we normally would put into effect in the planning process. I believe that, that's where we'll land in 2019. Susan Carter : And Steve, one other... C. Stephen Tusa : Yes. Including the $80 million? Including the $80 million, correct, that you just talked about what you know today? Michael Lamach : Exactly. Absolutely. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. Sorry. Go ahead, Sue. Susan Carter : That's right. So I just wanted to point out that if you are looking at the total impact on Ingersoll Rand, they -- the dollars that we're talking about is just under $30 million and the $80 million are from the Section 301. So there's also the Section 232 impact that we build in, in the July guidance which was about $38 million in 2018 and it's roughly $20 million for 2019. So I don't want to lose track of the fact that we were also trying to overcome the Section 232 piece of that in our pricing and our other mitigating actions for the price material cost equation. C. Stephen Tusa : Yes. I just want to make sure that everybody, you know, the $80 million -- anyway, I just want to make sure. But I kind of understand, so like what the kind of all-in dynamics are because you've covered a lot more than that in 2018 successfully and pricing, obviously, remains strong. Just one other quick one. On the productivity and other inflation, you talked about it's been kind of weak so far year-to-date, but you talked about its significant improvement in the fourth quarter. What is driving that significant improvement? Is that something that can carry through into '19? Michael Lamach : Yes. Steve, that's a good point. First of all, thanks for the clarification on the $80 million support. People know that we're covering that, still expect to get 20, 30 basis points net of 232, 301 and all of that. As it relates to productivity, it's been the same discussion all year long, which is just the way that productivity projects will load into the year to be a substantial increase in the fourth quarter. Some of these were larger footprint moves or complexity reduction projects across the company that really bear fruit in the fourth quarter. So it is a step up in the fourth quarter. Those projects are underway. They're implemented. They're defined. It's a pipeline. So it's not that we're hoping that productivity comes into the fourth quarter. We've got the projects that support that estimate. C. Stephen Tusa : Can that carry into '19? Michael Lamach : Well, we haven't done '19 yet. But the key with '19, just like price material inflation, what we'll do from a pipeline perspective is look at productivity offsetting all other inflation, anticipating wage inflation, anticipating logistics pressure, anticipating all the 232 stuff coming in still. We'll cover that through productivity. If you go back, again, in the operating system of the company, the question we ask ourselves is do we have 125% of what we need to do in the pipeline primed and ready for 2019. And that will be sort of the emphasis here as we exit the year is making sure the health of the pipeline is going to be that 125% which, historically, is what we've done and what we think we can continue to do for some time and in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS. Steven Winoker : Nice to see the progress, everybody. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Steve. Steven Winoker : Maybe just going back, I want to just clarify, that 25% operating leverage that you're getting this year, that is inclusive of that flattish price material inflation in the second half or not? Michael Lamach : It's all in, Steve. So we're saying that for the back half Q3, Q4, 25% is a good number and that's mitigating anything kind of coming in. Steven Winoker : Okay. Great. And maybe just on that $80 million that you just referenced and those headwinds, can you talk about the base that, that's on? In other words, maybe just putting that in context of the actual China kind of import volume or dollar volume to the U.S. Michael Lamach : Yes. Steve, probably not on this call. I mean, going to that detail because we have to separate a lot of what is more opportunistic supplier pricing coming in from what's a direct tariff. It's a very difficult analysis to make. At the end of the day, the analysis of that isn't so important as to know sort of what we think sort of the right numbers should be and then how to offset that with productivity and price. So it would be difficult to pull out in a call and give you anything reasonable. Steven Winoker : Okay. Fine. And then on the resi growth side, are you seeing sort of any direct benefit from kind of other supplier challenges in supplying their channels? And can you sort of -- is that a meaningful amount for you guys? Michael Lamach : Yes. We don't really -- as you know, we don't talk about this relative to any other competitor, but it's clear. And last quarter was no exception that, for the past 4 years, it's been substantial share gain and margin expansion in the Residential business, and that continued in the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just trying to stick to 2 questions. The first question just on the incremental margin point. You have more productivity in Q4 but you're saying the incremental margins stay in the mid-20s consistent with Q3, so just wondering what's moving there. And allied to that, are 25% incrementals the right sort of level for the current macro environment as you look out with high tariffs, high cost inflation, high volume growth? Michael Lamach : Let me do the second part first, and Sue might come back on the first part. But I think with the volatility of the environment we're in today, we've always said that we think that incremental margins should look like gross margins, but we always guided you all to think about that as sort of 25% allowing some room for breakage, allowing some room for investment in the business and all the things that create a healthy business for the long run, and that's what we're saying here. So I do think that leverage could go higher, particularly if we saw larger compressors kind of coming back in 2019, as an example, continued mix toward services being higher than equipment. That's certainly support of higher levers as well. But I think with the environment and the volatility we're in, 25% incremental is pretty good performance. I think it's really good performance. And I think that, that is something that we're committed to for the back of the year. Susan Carter : And Julian, on the other side of that, with the first part of your question, it's interesting as we go through the fourth quarter and all of the pieces that you see. So our pricing was, in effect, as we went through the guidance in July. We are adding in the impact of the additional tariffs that we didn't know in July when we gave that guidance. So you have a little bit of impact there. You have some additional productivity. But the other part, when we think about the overall bridge and those overall incremental margins, we're also continuing to invest in the business. And when I look at fourth quarter spend, we're not trying to cut back any of those good investments in whether it's new products or whether it was in the footprint in the fourth quarter, and so we've got some good investment spend also in the fourth quarter. Again, it's not an outlier compared to other quarters in the year, but it is slightly higher and we are continuing to do that throughout the year. Julian Mitchell : And then my second question would just be around Industrial segment demand. There seems to be more question marks around the sustainability of the backdrop for it. It sounds like though the only weak spot you have seen is some of those Chinese exporters around large compressors. If you could just confirm that's the case or if there are any kind of watch areas that you're focused on. Michael Lamach : Yes. Julian, let me take your question and expand it to a broader commentary around China just to give a sense for what we think is going on. And of course, we're trying to triangulate this not only with our own customers, but with other companies that are reporting earnings as well. The Industrial business versus the HVAC business are really 2 totally different worlds right now. Think about China's desire for clean air, clean water and the fact that 15% to 25% of all greenhouse gas emissions happen with HVAC and buildings, compound that with transport refrigeration where you've got a diesel engine powering refrigeration cycle on a trailer or truck, compound that with process cooling and air compressors going into industrial factories. Anything to do with clean air, clean water and retrofitting the economy, the built environment in China is going to be a good business and it might diverge a bit from sort of the narrower industrial economy. On the industrial economy, what we think we're seeing -- and this is before bookings. This is sort of the pipeline. This is customer communications and contact that we have. Chinese customers that would have had a bit of a U.S. export model are pausing, understand sort of what the rules of the game are going to be and whether they're going to be in play for the long term. These customers though, with that supply, are going to point that supply somewhere else in the world eventually. So midterm, long term, this excess capacity in China for exporters will find its way to other markets outside the U.S. I mean, inevitably, that's going to happen. But there is a bit of a pause, I think, on that export model from China to the U.S. based with what's happening with current negotiations around tariffs. And so we're just anticipating that, that could impact in the short run some of that, but these are customers that make decisions very quickly when there's an opportunity and so it's also something that could change very quickly for the positive. Operator : Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Gautam Khanna : Just to disaggregate the Climate bookings a little bit in Q3. First, do you still think that Q2 had a pull forward of about $80 million to $100 million? And how much did price contribute to the 10% bookings growth organically in the quarter? Michael Lamach : Our pull-through estimate wouldn't have changed there. It was just really strong across-the-board bookings, and you really can't find a soft spot. The only one that showed up on the chart was a little red dash, which happened to be the Middle East off a really tough comp. But everything is extremely strong, whether it's Residential, Transport, Commercial across the world. If you pull apart Commercial and look at Applied versus unitary versus services, everything is strongly in the green there as well. So the color is good. If you go around the world, I mean, you're seeing nice recovery in parts of Latin America for us. We're seeing, of course, outperformance in Asia Pacific, particularly with what we're doing in China. So all those things are contributing to a strong growth rate, but it's across the board. Gautam Khanna : Okay. And price on a net basis in that number, the 12%? Michael Lamach : Yes. So price remains strong in Climate, I mean, across the board. Of course, the short-cycle inventory in Residential or in light commercial, very quick there to have price effectivity. On the applied [ longer lead ] engineered systems, that's still building through the system. Of course, it's going to be shipping well through 2019. At this point, we built considerable backlog there as well as building several backlog in the trailer market, North America and in the auxiliary power unit market for North America. So I think when those products ultimately ship in 2019, you're going to see more price carried forward there as well. But price effectivity in Climate is the strongest I've ever seen it. Gautam Khanna : One follow-up on your comments on consolidation and just I noticed you underlined balanced allocation of capital on Slide 4. Mike, should we expect that large acquisitions aren't really part of the plan here? It's going to be more of what you've been doing, sort of the tuck-ins? Or do you see any case for something larger to actually unfold? Michael Lamach : Yes. I think maybe the bigger thing to talk about first is just making sure everyone knows that we're not changing the methodology and the discipline we've had around capital allocation for a long time now. And fundamentally, where we can invest organically in the business, we tend to see the highest ROICs and the quickest ROICs, and so that's evident with share and margin expansion that we've had over time. We believe in the fact that the dividend should grow at or equal net income over time, so we're continuing to make sure that investors are seeing that come through with the announcements that we make on dividends. Dilution, we like to control that so there's always going to be a little bit of buyback there to control dilution. And then, look, at the end of the day, it's looking at the available pipeline. And if we're seeing that we're able to generate return on invested capital in excess of our weighted average cost of capital, that we're building economic value for the company, we've been disciplined about that. We'll continue to do that. And clearly, we've bought back shares. I want to say we bought back $6.5 billion or 150 million shares since 2011, so that's been a big part of the equation. So we're looking to create long-term economic value, however we do that through that allocation of capital. We're going to continue to do it the same way we've been doing that. Bolt-on, certainly easy to do and less risk. And as I said to you on the large strategic, more transformative things, we don't need to do anything if it was incredibly compelling from an investor's point of view. We would look at that. I'm sure investors would want us to look at that, understand what our role in that could be. But at this point in time, it's all hypothetical and it's not really worthwhile to discuss the details of -- around those things for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Breindy Goldring : This is Breindy on for Josh. You mentioned that you've been gaining some share in Residential, and we know that one of your competitors had a recent outage that would require some share shift in the industry. Is that part of where the share gain come -- came from? And given that it should be a greater impact in 4Q, is that included in your current guidance or could we see some upside on share gain there? Michael Lamach : Yes. Breindy, we, about 5 years ago -- 4 or 5 years ago, redid most of the product line in res. We entered the opening price point. We modified our channel structure to be able to make sure that we have a product for every home and a channel partner for every product, if you will. So all of that has led to a long-term share gain margin expansion story for the company. And then we just don't talk about the specifics of any given competitor and share shifts between competitors. We just think it's best for our shareholders that we keep that close to our vest. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Bhupender Bohra : This is Bhupender here, sitting in for Nigel. Can you guys hear me? Michael Lamach : Yes. We hear you. Go ahead. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. This is Bhupender here for Nigel. So just wanted to focus on, I think, Sue mentioned about the service strength here in the quarter, 11%. Could you give some color from what actually is driving that growth in services, especially the contribution from digital and some software initiatives you actually have in place? Michael Lamach : Yes. It's a strategy. It's been a long-term strategy we've been executing for years to try to drive the mix of the company up from -- in services. And to go back historically, a decade ago that might have looked like more like 30% for the company. And you've looked at the Service-related businesses, which should be HVAC, Commercial and our Industrial air compressor businesses, much closer to 50% today. And for the company, we're all into the 40s. So I think that, that has been a long-term strategy. It's not a single event. It's a system of things. So it's the channel, it's a direct footprint, it's investing in people and in systems and tools because people are hard to come by at these sort of -- at this technical skill set we've had to. And it's been a good investment around technology and help leverage the ability for our people to get out and see more customers or to handle things remotely, so a lot of the diagnostic work in the background where the connected buildings or connected equipment has been very helpful to us in that. And then, of course, selling different value propositions, using the data and analytics out of systems to improve either building performance or industrial process has been well received. And one of the fastest-growing numbers that we have across the company is the number of connected buildings or connected assets today. It's a number that, every time I report it, it's up 500 or 1,000 buildings or customers the next time I report it. So that continues to be a really solid investment for us. We say digital, but it's more than just digital. It's the whole connected experience. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. That's great commentary. Just wanted to follow up here on the -- you guys have given some commentary on 2019 visibility here. Like when you look at the backlog, would you be able to comment on how Commercial HVAC backlog actually look by geographical regions? I mean, just puts and takes basically going into... Michael Lamach : Yes. It's record backlogs coming in. What you see here is sort of institutional backlogs that are very strong, that are continuing. We've talked in the past about large projects flowing through. It's interesting the numbers that we've been reporting all year haven't actually included any what we would think to be large projects. These large projects are still out there. We still think they're in scope for even this year, let alone 2019. That starts to set up very long-term visibility into '19 and potentially even to 2020 on some of these larger projects. So backlog there is great. Thermo King, it's pretty clear that the industry is under capacitized for trailers and for tractors. The demand is there. So as soon as a tractor needs an APU or a trailer needs a refrigerated unit, we're ready. We're able to meet that demand. So that's a definite backlog build going into 2019. And then large compressors, we'll wait and see what happens here for the balance of the year. We're coming off a tough comp quarter 4 of '17 as it relates to large compressors, but we'll see how that plays out. But that gives us great visibility into '19 as well, this large engineered compressors that we sell. Bhupender Bohra : Okay. Just one more actually here because you brought in the large compressor here. Just wanted to get a sense of China industrial compressor business if you look at that. Do you think the fleet -- the margins would be comparable to the fleet average or they would be like the segment average or below that? Just get a sense of... Michael Lamach : They're above. They're average to above. They're excellent. They're great. So China is important for the Compressor business for us and China is important for compressors globally in the market. About half the world's air compressors are sold into China, so it's important to kind of keep an eye on China. And as I said to you, it's -- that capacity in China is going to go somewhere. Maybe it goes along One Belt One Road, which is -- which you can think about that might be brilliantly timed in terms of where that capacity may end up. But these customers are aggressive, will make decisions quickly, that capacity will go somewhere. But in the short run, that's where I was cautioning that there could be a pause in some of that business. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : I want to back up a little bit. I mean, obviously, the market over the last month or so sees something -- thinks see something daunting out there, and you guys have come up with a pretty darn good quarter. One of the best quarters I think I can remember. How do you reconcile, really, what -- you've seen homebuilding stocks drop 50%, you've seen anything that touches even non-res construction get hit hard. I mean, how do you reconcile kind of that fear that you see out there with the fact that what you see is still a fairly healthy environment? Michael Lamach : Well, you think about the -- well, markets we're serving, again, 15% to 25% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions are happening from HVAC systems and buildings. And if we've launched technology 2 years ago in the applied space that eliminates greenhouse gas emissions by 99.9%, that's going to be a great business. If you think about trailers, the refrigeration cycle that -- running off a diesel engine that can be electrified using, again, a refrigeration cycle that eliminates 99.9% of those greenhouse gas emissions and you walk -- the industrial plants process cooling and air, we are center cut for a world looking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And so I don't know that you can just sort of lump us into an Industrial business selling machinery. I think you have to look at the businesses we're in. We happen to be in great businesses with technology that's differentiated and a channel that's differentiated and a service model that's differentiated. I think this is a long-term great story. So when you see these disconnects on the market, we hope there's investors out there saying this is a great entry point in a company like ours that's got great businesses and a track record of executing very well with smart capital allocation sort of supporting all that. Scott Davis : It's a fair point. And again, just to back up a little bit. I mean, do you get a sense, Mike and Sue, that it's easier to get price out there now than it has been in the past? I mean, partially just because of the front page news, the tariffs have been and maybe, partially, just because of the answer you just gave, just some differentiated technology. I mean, does it feel easier to you guys at least or seemed easier because you seem to catch up to the price cost curve pretty quickly? Michael Lamach : Well, if you think about the engineered systems, it could be large supply systems, large air compressor systems. That's where 10% of the cost of the total life cycle is the actual purchase price, 90% is the energy, the maintenance, the refrigerants, et cetera, used. It's easier if you got a value proposition that allows customers to see the efficiency advantages, the refrigerant advantages and so on and so forth to get price. So certainly, that helps. But as you get -- sliding into more of the commodity products, you get in their Residential HVAC with standard SEER levels, this is where Operational Excellence matters and where the dealer and distributor matter and why it's so important for us to have the best dealers and the best technology and the most cost-efficient operating footprint that we can to be able to really survive in that model. So there's mixed models around price, but clearly, where you're able to differentiate on technology is an advantage. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, so I think you mentioned last quarter that the Chinese HVAC market you sell is growing in the 5% range or so and that Ingersoll is growing in multiples of that. From what you could tell, is the market still growing at close to that rate? And have you been able to actually accelerate your outperformance in that market given you now have, obviously, the direct service model in place for a while, but you also talked about that service pull-through beginning to kick in? Michael Lamach : Yes. I think that you're going to find -- I think you're going to find, over time, that HVAC in China and the built environment in China might differentiate from sort of the industrial economy in China as it relates to sort of this tariff discussion. The built environment in China is 10x larger than the built environment in the U.S. A lot of that environment was built not at the highest level of codes, standards or efficiency levels, and so enormous retrofit opportunities to go in, make them more efficient and clean the air in doing this. So I think that, that is going to potentially be a good market for a long time, independent of what's happening in the narrower industrial economy. This is why we put the strategy in place to do what we did last year and made the investments that we made. And we're really pleased what's happening, not only with the penetration into the equipment side of that, but the linkage rates that are happening with services are very high. And it's giving us a lot of confidence that not only it was the right strategy, but the pace at which it's working is faster than what we would have thought. So I feel good about what's happening there, and I think we'll continue to outperform in China specifically. Andrew Kaplowitz : Maybe a similar question, North America institutional HVAC. So when you look at that strength, obviously, some of the strength is just the market itself. But could you give us some more color on your performance of the markets in the sense that I know you do performance-based contracting, your digital capability on these big applied jobs has improved. So has penetration there actually accelerated versus the market? And so as you look into 2019 and '20, that's what sort of results in this good visibility because you're really going to outperform the market based on what you see. Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, again, if you think of $4.5 billion, $5 million of Commercial North American HVAC business and you split it and set half of it service and half of it is equipment, the equipment, 85% of that is going to be replacement. It's a real opportunity to go create demand around the installed base and go create demand around energy efficiency. What you're finding now, in addition to that, is the institutional cycle started last year probably in earnest, still I think relatively early to mid-cycle in that. And then some of the larger projects tend to happen later in the cycle as it relates to larger campus environments, larger customers that have got more complex solutions to put in place, take more time to kind of get that designed, engineered and implement it. And so I think we enter that phase here in the next year or 2. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Evelyn Chow : This is Evelyn Chow, on for Joe. Maybe we'll just start on the Industrial incrementals have seen really nice progress on those incrementals throughout the year. If I think about sort of -- it sounds like the mix of bookings with large compressors and service, all seeming to grow. It seems like you're getting price. What kind of -- are the offsets to get us from the mid- to high-30% type incremental range we're seeing in 3Q down to sort of that 25% number we've talked about for the enterprise? Michael Lamach : Well, industrial leverage is higher than that, right? It's running kind of in the high 30s and it'll continue to leverage into the 30s throughout fourth quarter. They're doing it across the board though. It's -- they're executing well at the plant and operational level. They're executing well at the service level as well, so in the field, and they're investing in the business. And so it's -- the investments really have been relatively substantial, in fact, as you think about what they've been trying to do to upgrade some of the product portfolio the last year with that kind of leverage in place. So they're building it for the long run and I think that this continues to get leveraged well north of 30%, and we'd expect it to lever north of 30% in 2019. And we've always said is these larger compressors, if they do come back in some point in time, we tend to get very high leverage off those, so larger fixed costs that we have in place. Evelyn Chow : That's great, Mike. And then maybe just turning to the $80 million of tariff-related inflation and ways that you might mitigate. Is there any thought on potentially pre-buying some of your inventory instead of letting working capital normalize into 4Q? And then maybe as an addition to that, Sue, if you could provide us any color on how much metal spend you either bought or hedged into 4Q in 2019, that would be great. Michael Lamach : I think every time we look at sort of fundamentals of lean versus pre-buying lots of inventory, it comes down to you want to really run the business as lean as possible and you want to make sure supply chain is as short as possible. It tends to favor suppliers that are more localized than sort of long-distance suppliers. And so I think we continue on the journey that we've been on around lean throughout the company and look at that. The supply base is an extension of our lean efforts there. So Evelyn, on that front, I don't see us doing any pre-buys other than where there's constraints in the industry. So if there's a constraint around semiconductor boards or circuitry or a constraint around diesel engines, those are places that we buy or had to make larger commitments. But for the run-of-the-mill stuff we buy and the bill of material, we will continue to run that in the leanest way possible. Susan Carter : Yes. And Evelyn, I think when you think about our strategy around purchasing materials and all that and the impact of 2018 and 2019, we're obviously doing buys each and every quarter for not only the commodities, but to move the Tier 2 component. So if you think about 2019, I would say that you might be 50%, 60% bought or committed for the first half of the year and then less so in the second half of 2019. But I think the more important piece of how we buy, whether it's the commodities or some of our other materials, is I don't think you'd want to assume that because of where things are today that you would go and buy that even if it meant that you were slightly higher percentage of revenue. And why I say that is the tariffs and the whole discussion around inflation is a really volatile equation and you could find yourself buying because you think it's a great idea, and then all of a sudden maybe something goes away or speculation comes out of a commodity, say, copper and you have a lower price. I think you're better off following a routine, following a process and layering in your materials as you go throughout the year and making sure that you have the right sort of blended rate for the materials that you're buying in, and that's exactly what we do as we think about that. And my comments around working capital and where it goes, the 3.5% to 4% is a really natural level for us to really be able to support on-time deliveries and to support our customers. So while it comes down from Q3 to Q4, it isn't because we're unnaturally forcing it down. That's really just the normal cycle of inventory for us. So if there is an opportunity to have something that would be different, we'd certainly look at that. But I really think that ratably buying and following our natural processes is the right way to go. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : So definitely a lot of ground covered. And I just want to make sure I understand or maybe put a finer point around the visibility into '19, but we've talked about applied backlog being stronger, service growth, what's going on in Industrial around compression. Is there a way to quantify the better visibility you see into '19 as of today versus maybe historically or even last year? It would feel like you would have more visibility just given the way the dynamics are playing out than you've historically had into '19. Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, by virtue of the service business, being what it is, I mean you get more visibility because you have to believe service is going to continue. And in fact, if there's a downturn, you're going to see service go up as people extend asset life. So I would think that service growth, as it relates to visibility, is a better way of thinking about the mix over the long run. That helps. And then if you take sort of the equipment and systems businesses, nothing's really changed there other than the fact that you can see the backlogs building and you can understand from a correlation of the metrics that we use to establish the demand forecast, that they still tend to be favorable. So between what's in the backlog, what's in the pipeline and the metrics that are before the pipeline, that would be the leading indicators that we use. And there's different indicators for different businesses and different segments of the business and products even in the business. We're able to feel good about '19 at this point shaping up. Unless it's a dramatic geopolitical event, a dramatic event that's not seen today, we feel like 2019 is shaping up to be a good year. John Walsh : And then as we think about the energy retrofit business in the U.S., obviously, that's driven by replacement, the age of the assets if it breaks, energy code or new regulations. But are you seeing any changes around customer demand due to new financing mechanisms as new money enters that market to fund some of these upgrades? Is that helping drive some of this growth or is that not something you're seeing at all yet in the market? Michael Lamach : No. The vast majority is going to come through traditional customers financing their own deals and then there's performance contracting, which lends itself toward institutions that may not have the capacity at all times to -- plus this is an asset that they can -- it's one of the few assets that an institution has that can have a return. If you think about the assets and institution would generally hold, buildings being one of them, it's fortunate that the largest driver of their operating budget is often, is going to be utilities and some of the maintenance facilities. So that's always a great place that they would use financing in other areas and then use performance contracting as the way of getting at facility upgrades and improvements to their facilities. So no real changes though in how customers think about that today. Operator : Your next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Richard Kwas : Just a couple for me. Mike, on the mix for '19, knowing what you know now with your backlog and understanding there's still short-cycle stuff in the business you can't initially predict, but would you say the mix is neutral, better or worse than what you've seen in '18 mix of sales? Michael Lamach : Well, we're pulling apiece together now. We haven't taken a look at mix yet, but what I'd say is it comes back to running the whole P&L, understanding that we want to get leverage EPS growth in the business, cash flow ROIC to be where it's been historically and we'll work at each of our businesses to figure out what that looks like, but we don't have an early read on mix. I mean, at this point, if you're modeling anything, I'd model neutral mix. I -- we wouldn't have any better advice for you at this point. Richard Kwas : Okay. And then institutional, I mean, I think you're thinking it'll probably be a better year '19 than '18, right? So does that end up having -- is that a positive to mix with Service or neutral? Michael Lamach : Long run, it's positive because it's where the Service business gets billed is on the engineered systems. And then in the short run, you get a little bit of a gross margin hit, but overcome eightfold over the long run with the Service business that tails on top of that. So as you're modeling 2019, it's negligible but it would lean toward a little bit more compressed margin. But as you lean toward the out-years, the Service starts even in the warranty period. It tends to be a very good story. Richard Kwas : Okay. And then last one on Industrial, on compressors. Can you level set us on Service? You noted that is growing, outpacing equipment this quarter on orders, but where are you in terms of percentage of revenues on compressor service? Michael Lamach : About 50. I mean, it's sort of about half the business. Richard Kwas : Half the business. Okay. Great. Operator : We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Zac for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. As always, Shane and I will be available to take calls and questions today and certainly over the next several days and the coming weeks. We'll be on the road in New York and in the mid-Atlantic, so we hope to see some of you very soon. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Please go to Slide 3. Before discussing our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results, I'd like to begin with a brief review of the fundamental elements of our business strategy that underpin our financial performance and create value for our shareholders. First, our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource-constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings and industrial processes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Our business portfolio creates the platform for the company to consistently grow above-average global economic conditions aided by the strong secular tailwinds I've outlined. Second, our business operating system is designed to excel at consistently delivering strong top line growth, incremental margins and free cash flow. And lastly, over the years, we've built an experienced management team and a high-performance winning culture that makes our performance sustainable. When combined with our dynamic capital allocation strategy, we have a differentiated business model that drives strong shareholder returns over the long term.  Turning to Slide 4. Focused and consistent execution of our business strategy enabled us to deliver top-tier financial performance in 2018. We delivered top quartile organic bookings and revenue growth in each quarter and closed out full year 2018 with 13% organic bookings growth and 9% organic revenue growth for the enterprise. Adjusted earnings per share growth was also top quartile, up 24% for the year and up 29% in quarter 4. Despite persistent material and other inflation and tariff-related headwinds, our team successfully developed and delivered pricing and productivity actions that enabled us to effectively manage these costs and drive improved leverage and solid margin expansion throughout the year. Importantly, at the end of quarter 2, we set out to achieve significantly improved leverage of 25% in the second half of 2018. And the team delivered against that objective, while at the same time, delivering record organic bookings and record revenues.   Additionally, we achieved 10 basis points positive price/cost for full year 2018 with 60 basis points of enterprise adjusted operating margin expansion while at the same time continuing our healthy pace of incremental business investment, which is core to our ongoing differentiated operational and financial performance. Free cash flow for the year was 82% of net income, which lagged our 100% conversion target. The largest component of the shortfall is related to funding working capital above-normal levels through the end of the year in order to meet growing customer demand for our products and services. We also funded additional CapEx for high-ROI projects beyond what we expected when we entered the fourth quarter. We've delivered an average of 110% free cash flow to net income conversion over the past 4 years, and we expect to return greater than 100% in 2019. Lastly, in 2018, we also continued to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy. After investing in the business, including $366 million in capital expenditures, largely related to footprint optimization and plant consolidation, we deployed approximately $1.7 billion between dividends, share repurchases and mergers and acquisitions. Turning to Slide 5. Our performance against our initial guidance expectations was strong with exception of free cash flow, which I discussed earlier. We significantly beat on both the top and bottom lines and delivered strong margin expansion while managing inflation and tariff-related headwinds and making healthy investments on the business. Turning to Slide 6. Focused execution of our business strategy is delivering differentiated results in the marketplace and for shareholders, and we will maintain this focus going forward. Looking at 2019, we see the fundamental ingredients for another strong year. First, our end markets generally remain healthy, and I'll address that in more detail over the next couple of slides. Second, we're entering 2019 with record backlog in multiple business units after achieving exceptional bookings throughout 2018. This provides us with improved visibility into what to expect for 2019 revenues relative to where we'd have traditionally been at this stage in the year. Third, in 2018, we demonstrated our ability to effectively manage inflationary and tariff-related headwinds through pricing and productivity. Combined with higher expected volumes, we expect this to enable us to continue to deliver solid leverage, improving margins and strong EPS growth in 2019 as we did in 2018. For 2019, we're expecting free cash flow to exceed adjusted net income. We will continue to execute a dynamic capital allocation strategy that deploys capital where it earns the best returns. This includes organic investments, dividends, mergers and acquisitions and share repurchases. On the M&A side, we have an active pipeline of attractive opportunities that will be a strong fit with our core business strategy. If or when these become actionable and affordable, we're in a strong position to execute any transactions. We also continue to see value in our own shares, which are trading well below calculated intrinsic value. Lastly, based on our performance in 2018 and our guidance for 2019, we're firmly outpacing the glide path to achieving our 2020 Investor Day revenue growth, EPS and free cash flow guidance that we laid out during our midyear 2017 Investor Day. Given the tremendous amount of inflation and tariffs the industry has endured over the last 2 years, we're moving along that glide path a bit differently than what we expected in 2017, but we're well ahead of the curve nonetheless. Turning to Slide 7. Our end markets continued to show strength throughout the fourth quarter, and 2019 appears to be shaping up as another solid year. In Commercial HVAC, the markets remained strong in virtually all geographies, and we delivered strong bookings growth and revenue growth across the product portfolio. Europe has shown mixed economic signals over the past few months, but HVAC activity remains healthy there as well. China had a solid quarter in HVAC with good growth in both equipment and services. Our direct sales strategy in China continues to progress well against our expectations, and we're making good inroads in a number of verticals, including infrastructure, which has been a key focus for us and continues to be one of the strongest verticals. The situation remains fluid with trade war uncertainty. But at this point in the year, we're still expecting to see modest market growth and market share expansion opportunities in China. Outside of China, the Asian markets are mixed. In total, our global outlook for the Commercial HVAC market continues to be positive with low single-digit to mid-single-digit market growth expected. Turning to residential. Quarter 4 was a very strong quarter for us with continued share gains, primarily driven by replacement demand, and we expect the majority of the market growth to come from the replacement market in 2019 as well. This plays well into our business mix, which is about 85% replacement. Economic indicators have softened modestly but is still healthy and supportive of growth for the year.  Turning to Slide 8. Our Transport business continues to be a globally diversified and resilient business with good growth opportunities across multiple areas. In 2018, we saw exceptional order growth for North American trailers and auxiliary power units, and we built a healthy backlog as a result. In 2019, our strong backlog position for these businesses gives us solid visibility into revenue growth for the year as we work to convert this backlog to revenue over time. The European transport markets are mixed with trailer a bit weaker and truck a bit stronger as Brexit uncertainty is impacting these markets. We think additional clarity around this topic would be a positive catalyst. Overall, we're expecting low single-digit to mid-single-digit market growth for transport refrigeration in 2019.  Our Compression Technologies business had good growth globally in the fourth quarter with North America and Europe healthy. We continue to see trade war uncertainty impacting projects in China. Global services growth continued to outpace equipment growth in the fourth quarter, which is a positive, and is well supported by multiple service initiatives focused on increasing attachment rates of services to equipment and increasing our share of wallet of total services provided within accounts. All things considered, we expect to see low single digit -- mid-single-digit growth in the Compression Technologies market in 2019 with China being the main area to watch closely. Small electric vehicle growth continues to be powered, primarily by our consumer and utility businesses. We expect to see healthy growth in 2019. Our Industrial Products businesses, including Fluid Management, Tools and Material Handling markets, remained healthy and expect to see continued solid growth in these businesses in 2019. And now I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter and discuss our 2019 guidance. Sue? Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #9. I'll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we drove solid operating and financial results in the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.32, an increase of 29% versus the year-ago period. Our earnings growth in Q4 closed out a strong year in which we delivered adjusted earnings per share growth in excess of 20% in each quarter. Organic bookings and revenue growth was strong in both our Climate and Industrial segments. In our Industrial segment, we delivered 6% organic bookings and revenue growth. Organic bookings growth was healthy in the fourth quarter despite a difficult comparison of 12% organic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. On the Climate side, organic bookings were exceptional, up 20%, including a large Commercial HVAC order that will provide revenue over the next 3 to 4 years. Excluding this order, organic bookings growth was still outstanding, up 13%. These exceptional organic growth rates accelerated despite difficult comparisons with very strong growth rates of 7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 10% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Organic revenue growth was also exceptional, up 9%, and was broad-based across all of our Climate businesses and across both equipment and services. As Mike discussed, free cash flow was 82% of adjusted net income, primarily due to funding higher working capital to support our exceptional bookings and revenue growth and funding additional CapEx for strong projects in the fourth quarter. We continue to drive high-quality earnings and expect to deliver free cash flow in excess of 100% of adjusted net income in 2019. Leveraging our business operating system for operational excellence across the enterprise, we continued to manage direct material, tariff-related and other inflationary headwinds in the quarter. During Q4, we delivered our targeted 25% operating leverage and expanded adjusted operating margins 90 basis points. For the year, our 60 basis point adjusted operating margin improvement was towards the higher end initial guidance. Importantly, we also delivered on our dynamic capital allocation strategy in 2018. We deployed $480 million in dividends and increased the dividend 18% during the year, consistent with our commitment to maintaining a strong and growing dividend over the long term. We deployed $900 million on share buybacks as the shares continued to trade below our calculated intrinsic value. We also deployed $285 million on strategic mergers and acquisitions in 2018, the majority of which was committed to spend in 2017. Looking forward, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time.  Please go to Slide #10. As we discussed on the previous slide, the fourth quarter was highlighted by continued strong organic bookings and revenue growth in both of our segments as indicated by the positive signs on the chart. These results reflect continued strong execution of our strategy, capitalizing on healthy end markets. The minus sign on the chart was a revenue decline in Commercial HVAC in the Middle East where orders and accompanying revenues can be lumpy. Last quarter, we highlighted that there were a couple of large orders in the third quarter of 2017. These orders shipped in the fourth quarter of 2017, creating a difficult comparison for us in the fourth quarter of 2018. European HVAC orders and revenues showed continued strength in the quarter. Please go to Slide #11. We delivered organic revenue growth of 8%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 90 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 29%. Strong gains in volume from ongoing investments in new products, panel and system controls are delivering results in virtually every business and geography where we compete. Consistent disciplined focus on productivity and pricing actions enabled us to effectively manage inflation and tariff-related headwinds and drive margin expansion across the enterprise. Please go to Slide #12. The focused execution of our business strategy, underpinned by our business operating system, enabled us to drive solid year-over-year earnings per share growth in the quarter. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter of operating income growth. Our Industrial segment delivered solid results with our Compression Technologies business, in particular, levering over 40% in the quarter. Corporate productivity initiatives drove $0.05 of earnings per share growth year-over-year. Below the operating income line, other expenses related to legacy legal matters negatively impacted results by approximately $0.04. All in, we delivered 29% earnings per share growth with strong results across the enterprise.  Please go to Slide #13. Strong execution drove 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter. Price versus material inflation was positive by 40 basis points in the quarter and positive by 10 basis points for the full year, reflecting strong pricing efficiency and a return to more normal price/cost despite the extraordinary inflation we were up against in 2018. Productivity versus other inflation was notably stronger in Q4, improving margins by 30 basis points. For the full year, productivity fully offset other inflation. We also continued to reinvest heavily in our business with incremental Q4 investments of approximately 60 basis points, pretty evenly weighted between operating expense reduction projects to drive further productivity, footprint optimization, plant consolidation projects for Commercial HVAC and Compression Technologies and new product development and information technology investments. All of these investments work in concert to make Ingersoll-Rand a stronger and more resilient business. Please go to Slide 14. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter with 9% organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points. Consistent with our expectations, results were strong across the segment. Please go to Slide 15. Our Industrial business also delivered strong results with 6% organic revenue growth and 40 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion with Compression Technologies leveraged up more than 40%. Outside of Compression Technologies, the overall Industrial segment leverage was negatively impacted by discrete accrual adjustments and a legal settlement, totaling approximately $5 million. We expect Industrial segment leverage will be strong moving into 2019 as it has been over the past several quarters. Please go to Slide 16. In 2018, we executed a dynamic and balanced capital allocation plan, deploying capital where it earns the highest returns for our shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high-ROI projects to help customers solve their most complex challenges. These investments helped drive our strong growth in both segments during 2018. Beyond that, we invested $366 million in CapEx, largely on footprint optimization and cost-out programs which build a stronger, more resilient Ingersoll-Rand. We maintained a strong balance sheet that provides us with good optionality as our markets evolve. We executed against our long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend. During 2018, we've raised the dividend 18%. Additionally, we deployed approximately $900 million on share repurchases as the shares continued to trade below intrinsic value. As we look forward to 2019, we remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the best return on investment opportunities. We're enthusiastic about the future and the opportunities ahead to deploy excess capital to the best ROI investments, whether that be investment in the business, raising the dividend, repurchasing shares or making value-accretive strategic acquisitions. Please go to Slide 18. I'll spend a few minutes walking you through the details of our 2019 guidance. Given the market backdrop Mike outlined earlier, we expect total reported revenues to be up 4% to 5% in 2019 with the Climate segment growing slightly faster than Industrial. The difference between our reported and organic revenue contemplates about 1 percentage point of negative foreign exchange impact year-over-year. For the enterprise, we delivered solid leverage and margin expansion in the back half of 2018. In 2019, we expect further margin expansion in each segment and enterprise adjusted operating margin expansion of between 30 and 80 basis points. Please go to Slide #19. We expect continuing adjusted earnings per share for 2019 to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.35, excluding about $0.25 of restructuring. We've modeled approximately $500 million in share repurchases into our guidance, which translates into approximately 244 million diluted shares for 2019. As I outlined earlier, we're committed to a dynamic and balanced capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash over time. Net, the actual allocation of excess cash will depend on where we see the highest ROI opportunities over the coming quarters. We're targeting free cash flow to be greater than 100% of net income. The adjusted effective tax rate is estimated to be between 21% and 22%. And for your modeling purposes, we also offer the following guidance : corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $250 million; capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million, primarily driven by footprint optimization, factory consolidation and new product development initiatives. Below operating income, we estimate interest expense to be approximately $200 million, reflecting the debt refinancing we did in early 2018. Additionally, we estimate that pension-related expenses that are classified within the other income and expense line will be approximately $40 million for 2019. We do not plan other income or expense line items outside of pension. These items are truly other and not estimable in advance. I would like to cover 2 topics of interest with you. Please go to Slide 21. It's hard to keep track of what's happening with tariffs relative to what's in and what's out of guidance, so we thought it might be useful if we laid out the assumptions that we're using. The guidance I just laid out includes the known direct and indirect impacts we expect from the Section 232 tariffs, the Section 301 tariffs, including Lists 1, 2 and 3, which is the full $200 billion and the expected China retaliatory tariffs. Relative to the Section 301 tariffs, we have included a planned step-up from 10% to 25% on March 1, 2019, at the conclusion of the 90-day negotiation period. As we've said a number of times during this call, we expect to be able to effectively manage the inflationary and tariff-related impacts in 2019 as we manage these types of costs in 2018. To be clear, however, if the step-up from 10% and 25% does not occur, you should not anticipate we'll see a windfall gain. We will implement the pricing actions necessary to cover the actual inflation we see. The next topic, which is on the same slide, is on 2019 restructuring costs. We thought it would be helpful to provide a little extra content beyond what we included in the main presentation. The restructuring we're doing in 2019 is largely aimed at proactively taking steps to build stronger, more resilient businesses in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Of the estimated $0.25 of restructuring in 2019, more than 80% relates to our ongoing footprint optimization and plant consolidation efforts. Each optimization project is expected to reduce our fixed cost base and improve operational efficiencies, which benefits us no matter the economic conditions we encounter going forward. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Sue. Please go to Slide 22. We believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years, and our 2018 financial results bolstered our confidence. We'll be the first to recognize that 2018 was, by no means, a perfect year, that we have room for further improvement. However, our ability to solve complex problems and overcome escalating headwinds to drive continuous improvement in our results through 2018 is encouraging and gives us confidence our business operating system and high-performing teams are prepared to successfully navigate the evolving landscape ahead. I want to extend my full appreciation to our talented people throughout the world that are committed to delivering excellent results for our customers and shareholders. Our strategy is firmly tied to attractive end markets that are healthy and growing profitably. Our products and services portfolio is at the nexus of global energy efficiency and sustainability mega trends, which provides a tailwind for growth, above-average economic conditions over the long term. Unless you believe the world is getting less populated, cooler and less resource-constrained, these secular mega trends will continue to create growth opportunities for Ingersoll-Rand. Successful execution of this strategy enabled us to deliver exceptional bookings and profitable revenue growth in every quarter of 2018. We have an experienced management team and a high-performing team culture that incorporates operational excellence into everything we do. Our business operating system and our culture are a differentiated and sustainable competitive advantage. And lastly, our business model generates powerful cash flow, and we are committed to dynamic deployment of capital. We have a strong track record of generating free cash flow and deploying excess cash to shareholders over the years. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Boy, there's not much to pick on in this quarter at all. But you made a couple of comments I just wanted to dig into a little bit, in particular, really, about the push to the right on some of the commercial projects in China. Is it the opinion of your local guys that this is just more of a delay or maybe something a little bit more -- or something more tied to the tariff outcome? Or what's really the color behind some of those comments? Michael Lamach : Yes. You have to separate the business a bit, Scott. So take HVAC, where we saw, again, a really strong bookings growth and continued momentum there in services as well. And in those markets, I think it's less susceptible, particularly on the government, commercial side involving infrastructure institutional work, that there's more of a bias toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And as I've said hopefully a thousand times, if you're going to go attack the greenhouse gas emissions problem anywhere, you're going to hit HVAC, whether it's stationary or transport first because it's 15% to 25% of most economies' global house -- greenhouse gas emissions. So I don't think that China lets its foot off the gas around codes, compliance and regulations that would improve air and water quality. That being said, you look at the Industrial business, and here, I think the trends are largely the same. Interestingly, we saw good growth in some of the smaller compressors, some of our Contact Cooled Rotary and certainly in our air -- in our rotary compressor lineup in general. But certainly, all 3 would have been part of that. So that continues. What I get mostly from our suppliers and from our customers that are in China, exporting outside of China particularly to the U.S. is they are waiting to see. However, some of them are moving more rapidly to put incremental capacity in Asia outside of China. So Vietnam is a favorite spot for that right now. So I think that you're already seeing sort of actions taken by Chinese companies that export. I think you'll continue to see that going forward. And by the way, it's a positive, Scott, for us because it doesn't matter sort of where they set up shop. We're going to be able to support them. Scott Davis : Yes. That's going to be my natural follow-on is that are you a net winner or a net loser? I mean, you have critical mass in China and some those other regions, maybe you don't or do you, I guess, is kind of... Michael Lamach : Yes. We have strong footprint throughout Asia, so you really can't get to a part of Asia where we don't have a team on the ground, a sufficient capacity of supply. So it would be good. So long as that capacity is unlocked somewhere, we would have opportunity. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Can we just dig into the bridge, the margin bridge a little bit? What was exactly an investment in other? And then could you maybe just give some color on how you see kind of that price material number kind of trending? And I think you said no windfall if the tariff doesn't go through, but like you're already 40 bps ahead of the game here, definitely better than we expected in 4Q. I would think that can get better on its own, ex tariffs, next year maybe. Just give a little bit more color on how you see both of those parts of the bridge broadly trending in the 2019 guidance. Michael Lamach : Yes. Steve, so you say sort of walk through the bridge. Are you thinking about the 2019 bridge or the 2018 fourth quarter bridge? C. Stephen Tusa : Yes. In the context of what happened in the fourth quarter, I guess, 2019. So maybe just explain the 60 bps, what was in there in the 4Q and then moving beyond to 2019, how you'd see that play out. Michael Lamach : Yes. I would start and let Sue finish. The price over material inflation was something that we had hoped to get back to, say, 0 for the full year. We got to 10 basis points, so roughly at our expectations there. That worked out, materialized as we hoped it would. One of the questions going into '19, then, is why is there not more positive price versus cost given some of the carryover. And what I would say there is you got to remember that the 232 tariffs were implemented in April and May, and the 301 were implemented in October. So the first half still sees headwinds from tariffs that didn't exist last year at the same time. We also would see commodity inflation in quarter 1 and quarter 2 still. See -- still see steel as being the largest, copper as being next. And of course, the Tier 2 knock-on effect that contains these metals would be inflationary in the first half of '18. But by quarter 2, you start to lap the majority of price from '18. Materials begin to get perhaps deflationary, but tariffs remain in our model. So you might see a wider spread in Q3 or Q4, but it's pretty early to call out how that looks. But our plan is laid out, as I've just expressed, in that regard. Sue, any of the bridge items? Susan Carter : Yes. So if you think about, Steve, your question on investments in the fourth quarter and going into 2019, so the investments in the fourth quarter were as we had planned them throughout 2018, and they're primarily investments in operational excellence and new product development and some of the footprint optimization that we were doing. And those actually do carry over, and we continue to invest in the business as part of our capital allocation strategy in 2019. So nothing terribly unusual or unexpected as you think about either the fourth quarter of 2018 or where we're going in 2019. It's that overall strategy of really providing for projects that make us operationally better, increase productivity and allow us to manage the business. Michael Lamach : Sue, I'd probably add one point, which is when you think about the productivity over a long period of time creating higher utilization and really opening up new capacities, we've taken the decision over the years to slowly as projects emerge and you can consolidate, reduce footprint, we've done that. But you've seen in 2018 and 2019 a more aggressive view toward that. There was a step-up in '18, not quite as high a step-up in '19. That's, at this point, sort of the last of what we see as the larger projects would entail for us. And we want to be clear that we're not thinking about a recession in 2019, but we wanted to get, really, in front of that final large restructuring now. And just really in the event that something would happen into the future around recession, we're just going to be that much more resilient around that. So that's another part of what the investments involved through '18 and certainly in the fourth quarter of '18. C. Stephen Tusa : Historically, that investment number is kind of a modest negative. Is that what we should think about for '19, a more modest negative? Michael Lamach : Well, the total investment number on the bridge itself is always right around 40, 50 basis points, and that's exactly what we'll be modeling in '19. C. Stephen Tusa : Got it. And then one last one. Normal seasonality, first half to second half next year. How should we think about seasonality for 1Q and the rest -- and next year? Michael Lamach : Steve, I love you're adapting your question because I was expecting the one about quarter 1, and so let me answer that one actually first because I appreciate you're taking a longer view on that. Quarter 1 is usually the part that I think creates the most confusion around investors. But historically, if you look at the 3-year average, we've been around 12.4%. If you go to a long-term average, it's been around 11.1%. So I think that when you think about the seasonality for us, it largely comes into the first quarter. And for models that are between 11% and 12.5%, you're kind of in a safe range. If you're north of that, you're probably figuring out something that we don't know about. So that's how I would kind of give you some thoughts around quarter 1. The rest of the year sort of works itself out. I don't think there's been that many situations where there's been confusion around the back half of the year or even quarter 2. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe a first question around the free cash flow within that step-up of conversion in 2019. I think you're guiding for CapEx to drop almost 20%, but you're still guiding for operating cash flow to grow about 25%, so double the EBIT growth guide. Maybe just spell out, is that mostly coming from receivables, for example? And how quickly through the year do you think we see that improvement given your cash flow tends to be pretty seasonal? Susan Carter : Yes. Julian, it should be a good story for us in 2019. We really do expect to have greater than 100% of net income and free cash flow. And so as you take apart those pieces, let's talk about CapEx for a second with the approximately $300 million guide for 2019. That is lower than 2018. That was $366 million, and there's a couple of components to that. We made a couple of decisions on projects in 2018. We had some carryover where we had a warehouse facility where we were doing a warehouse consolidation, absolutely a good project. We made a decision to lease versus buy. So long story... Michael Lamach : That will be around owned versus leased. Susan Carter : All right. Owned versus -- sorry, sorry, Mike. The -- so as you think about the CapEx, it sort of normalizes back into our more 1% to 2% of revenues range in 2019. So that's helpful. As you think about working capital, working capital isn't going to change from an overall strategy viewpoint, which is that you're always going to be looking to balance out your customer terms and your supplier terms. So DSO and DPO, always looking to balance those out. And on inventory, you're looking to make sure that you have enough product to meet the demand that we have, which has, of course, been quite strong, and at the same time, meet your on-time customer delivery. What I would expect to see in the free cash flow guide in 2019 is that as we move through 2019 that the working capital as a percentage of revenue is also going to normalize back more into our 3% to 4% range of the long-term guide. So we're moving back into more of the longer-term metrics in the 2019 statistics, and that's what gives us the additional bump in free cash flow for next year. Julian Mitchell : Great. And then my second question, maybe a bit more color on what you're seeing in Europe overall. I think you'd mentioned that in Thermo King, you have some specific watch items, which are understandable. But anything interesting changing in Trane or on the Industrial side in terms of customer spending appetite and so forth and maybe split anything on Western Europe versus the Middle East. Michael Lamach : Well, we've had a very strong HVAC year in quarter 4 in Europe and so that continues. And again here, this is this bifurcation between economies very focused on energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and making the regulatory changes to make that happen. So the growth rates there are outstanding. And then you're looking at sort of the Industrial side of Europe is slower than that, of course, as you -- I think factoring in sort of a sloppier Brexit, and I think the economy is a little bit in a slower mode there. But all in all, it's not -- it's certainly not that in Industrial and Europe for us, and it's been great in HVAC. Middle East has been choppier with the way orders come in there. Generally, you're talking about district cooling plants that are extremely large and whether they build them or not or modify them or not can make a difference quarter-to-quarter. So I think the environment there is good for us. It's just a matter of lumpiness in the orders. So we're relatively optimistic on Europe and certainly the Middle East as well. In terms of transport refrigeration in Europe, it's a little bit mixed. You've got a slowdown in Western Europe. You've got continued growth in Eastern Europe. You see a little slower European trailer market and you see a little stronger European truck market. And again, I think this is just really working through some of the general economic concerns, largely Brexit. And clarity on Brexit, frankly sort of a good outcome there. Clarity would be sort of a baseline outcome, I think, is a positive for the market and for our businesses. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Gee, Mike, it sounds like you had that Q1 answer prepared. Michael Lamach : I didn't want to disappoint Steve on that one, so I got it. Nigel Coe : 12.4%, that was pretty specific. So the large commercial order, I don't think I've ever seen you call out an order of that size and such a long cycle. So maybe just a bit more color in terms of that and how that progresses. And what's the market like for that kind of size of order? I mean, are you seeing, are there opportunities that are of scale out there? Michael Lamach : Yes. We actually had one in 2016 that I wish we would have called it out in 2016 because that created a little bit of confusion in '17 when it lapped. I think it was in the $120 million range. This one's closer to $200 million. So I think that we're going to see more of these where it's a holistic approach toward reducing energy use in facilities, campuses, buildings, reducing the energy intensity, maybe even getting some grid flexibility moving toward alternative power. We're seeing more of that. And so for us, we're seeing that it involves design, equipments, lots of controls, service moderating over time and then some subcontracts that will go along with that. So they're lumpy. I've been quite talking about this for 3 or 4 quarters. So that's one of the larger projects that we thought we would close, and I think these things will get spotted in over time. This particular project will last about 40 months, and it will burn revenue in a pretty linear fashion. And we like that. We like the -- again, the resiliency over 4 years of having a nice base of business to build on. The margins are pretty good, and so it shouldn't really affect what we expect to be good leverage for the business going forward. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's really helpful. And then I think you mentioned your share is below intrinsic value for, I think, 3 or 4 times during the call. You also mentioned M&A opportunity. So I'm actually wondering, given that you consider your share price too cheap right now, is the needle for incremental dollars still towards buybacks? Or do you see opportunities out there to deploy M&A more accretively than share buybacks? Any comment there would be helpful. Michael Lamach : Yes. It's both, Nigel. I mean, you can expect that it would be both for us. And it's really looking at the actionability, affordability, the ROICs of the M&A that's out there based on what we think we could do that for and then comparing that toward intrinsic value. Of course, the benefit on the acquisition is building a compounding base of cash over time, particularly if they're good businesses, strategically fit the core of the company. So that's the focus. But as you know, we're not going to let cash sit around for long, and we're going to deploy it somewhere. And that's what certainly happened in the fourth quarter where you saw us actually stepped up the buyback in the fourth quarter. Balance sheet is in great shape, so plenty of capacity there and flexibility to work with the balance sheet going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So just to clarify a couple of points on the cash flow, Sue. So obviously, nice step-up expected in 2019. You guys are expecting roughly 40% growth. Get the CapEx point, it seems like the delta is -- half of it seems to be coming from working capital improvement, half of it coming from earnings growth or EBIT growth, core EBIT growth. And so on the working capital side, are you assuming the turns get a turn better? Or how should we be thinking about that working capital piece? Susan Carter : Yes. If I think about, Joe, and I go back a little bit with the working capital as a percentage of revenue, where we would have called that at year-end would have been probably 3.4%, 3.5%, somewhere right in the middle of our 3% to 4% range. And it ended up at 4.3%. So you actually do get, to your point, about a full point of that coming out of there. And again, it is a process where it is not just making a decision of whether you're going to have inventory there or not. I mean, there's a series of levers that happen. As you see the demand forecast, as you plan what's going to happen in the factories and you plan how you're going to actually efficiently manage those factories going through time to meet the on-time customer delivery. So your point is the right one. The inventory will probably come down over time, and everything else remains balanced. But it does go back into that 3% to 4% of revenue range, which is what gives you the uplift. Michael Lamach : And of course, Joe, we delivered really outsized cash and a slowdown, so it's kind of a good problem to have as we're funding growth here. And it's not a worry in terms of what we think about every day. Cash would be not a worry in terms of our ability to deliver that. We've done it historically. We'll do it in 2019, and there was good reason in '18. The plan we always have is to increase turns. We usually plan it about half a turn, but we always throttle it back. The trump card there is always on-time shipment, on-time delivery. And when you've got sort of volatile order rates particularly biasing upwards, we want to make sure we've got plenty of safety stock or increase  Kanban sizes just to be able to handle particularly hard-to-get components and parts. And so we're just going to make sure that we're making hay while the sun is shining. So Sue's point is exactly right, but we want to make sure to fulfill the growth and do it on time. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. So maybe -- and said another way, if the order book looks good as the year progresses and you may have to build inventory again next year, and that's just a good problem to have. Michael Lamach : Well, our growth rate's -- the forecast is probably half of what it was last year. So I think, to Sue's point, you're going to see working capital come down anyway there a little bit. I think we comfortably get above 100%, just based on that. But it's a 12-round fight, so you need to think about how this is going to evolve over the year. And if we've got a good outcome on some of the stuff that's out there, whether it's the debt ceiling negotiations or Brexit or China-U.S. tariff discussions. If it's a blue sky scenario there, we're going to adjust, as necessary, to go fulfill that. Joseph Ritchie : Yes. No. That makes sense. And, Mike, just to follow on your question -- your comment earlier around talking about these large projects for several quarters. I recognize the lumpiness, but it'd be helpful if you can maybe talk about the pipeline, whether you see like the pipeline as being pretty robust today or you are certain to see some of these projects come through and maybe a little bit less full than maybe what you saw over 12 months ago. Michael Lamach : Yes. Look, I think that these projects kind of go in sort of 2 to 5 at a time that are out there on the horizon. They take often 2, 3 years to develop. We'll often put $10-or-more million into the development of the project, you can imagine. And so as we get closer and closer toward thinking we've got something, we can certainly do that. This year we knew that we had 1 or 2, turned out to be the one really large one. There's a couple of smaller but in the magnitude of $50 million to $125 million that are out there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : There continues to be some concern that resi HVAC, for you, will slow down at some point given weakened housing. But we know you're projecting low to mid-single-digit growth for the resi market in '19 based on replacement demand.  Did your resi growth in Q4 match overall Climate growth in the high single digits? And do you think 2019 could be another year of share gains for Ingersoll? Or should we think Ingersoll grows more in line with the market in '19? Michael Lamach : Are you talking about resi, Andy? Andrew Kaplowitz : Yes, yes. Michael Lamach : Yes. So resi, really, from 2013 to the present, and I would say, 18, for sure, of consecutive quarters in a row, we had share gain. And we really changed the strategy in '13, product distribution, the model, investments in digital. And so for 18 straight quarters without a hiccup, we've had share gain there. It was the same in the fourth quarter of this year, and the markets there remained strong. You have to realize that 85% of what we do is going to be in the replacement market, not the new construction market. So think about the context of Ingersoll-Rand, you think about Residential HVAC as being less than 10% of our revenue, so you can think about -- obviously, you're talking about a really small number, 1% to 2% being new construction. And if that fell up, even 20%, would be a negligible dip for us. We're really built towards the replacement market, and I think that's going to continue to be strong. Andrew Kaplowitz : Okay. And maybe, Mike, if I can ask you about the U.S. Commercial HVAC market. Obviously, a lot of questions on the large projects. But even after that, 13% organic bookings growth in the quarter was very strong. Looking to 2019, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you have better visibility here than you've had. Some people still question how we're late cycle. But if you look at the strength that you've seen, is it still broad-based between institutional/applied markets, the unitary markets? Is institutional going to lead the way in 2019? And does this backlog that you have really start kicking in 2020 at this point? Michael Lamach : Well, a couple of things, Andy. One is certainly the Applied business remains strong, but I have to tell you the strength of the unitary, commercial unitary market was really strong as well. And so this just gives us a general sense about the sort of underlying economic conditions in the U.S. are still pretty positive. It's got long legs to have had that kind of growth for this long, particularly the results we had in the fourth quarter in commercial unitary. The applied and institutional work continues to move along nicely. Education and health care, about 50% sort of that mix, and we think that education continues to be strong. We think that the health care continues to be strong. No outliers there that we're seeing on that front, so we think we've got a solid backlog built for '19. And as I mentioned earlier on the question regarding the larger contract that we booked that Nigel asked, that thing is a 4-year [ span ]. So I think this thing has got legs through '19, for sure. Now recognize, too, Andy, for people that needed -- just to kind of keep it in context, when you think about our Commercial HVAC business, you got to think about 50% equipment, 50% service. You get to the equipment piece of this thing, it really breaks down pretty quickly between institutional and commercial. But the large component of what we do there is still replacement buildings in the U.S., and so I think there's always an opportunity for us to have more energy-efficient, more environmentally friendly ideas going into customers, and so there's a demand-creation opportunity here as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : Maybe just to circle back to the margin bridge into 2019 for Climate, I was just wondering if there's anything to call out in terms of mix. You obviously gave us the market growth rates for some of the sub-businesses, but is there anything Ingersoll-specific there and then anything as it relates to the different growth rates between equipment and service as you think about the margin impact? Michael Lamach : So nothing remarkable jumps out to me at all on the year. It's pretty straight stick. I think that we're right -- you're right in the ballpark there, too, of 25% leverage. That will continue to improve throughout the year. The mix, if anything, I mean, perhaps a little bit on the res side or the TK side because we continually expand more of the opening price point for the product line. With TK, there could be some mix with Europe being a little bit weaker and a bit more profitable than North America, a bit more maybe toward truck versus trailer in Europe. So little things on the edges, but I think it's a pretty straightforward year. The visibility around the backlog for TK, particularly around North American trailer units and around, obviously, power units, is the most visibility we ever had in that business. I think we feel that way about the backlog in HVAC entering the year as well, too. So a relatively straightforward plan here, I think. John Walsh : Got you. And then as we think about these restructuring benefits rolling through from the $94 million in 2018, you obviously call out the $0.25 and them having a 4-year here payback. I mean, how should we think about what's actually carrying over from earlier actions into '19 and then even starting to think about '20? And what kind of tailwind some of these restructuring actions could have? Or is it going to be later than that? Susan Carter : So, John, the way I would think about it is the bigger pieces of the restructuring that we've been talking about in the footprint optimization arena between 2017, 2018 and what we're projecting into 2019 is sort of in the range of the 5 to 7 factories and those less than 5-year paybacks over time. So you're going to continue to build. We started that process in 2017, and so you're going to build savings as you go through each of the years going out into -- there will be savings, obviously, in 2019, but there will be increasing savings in 2020, 2021 from these projects. And again, it is really about optimizing the footprint, building capacity and building a better Ingersoll-Rand in the catching locations that's there. But it does provide a good return, and it does have a great payback. Michael Lamach : I'd say, John, once we make these announcements into '19 and as we think about extending the next round of long-term plan and guidance that we do, this is something that will factor into improved margins and costs, of course, lower fixed costs in the company going forward. And I think we can probably help recast that sometime later in the year for all investors to understand the benefit of what's happened. And so we'll make a note to do that once we are -- have announced our intentions. Susan Carter : And I think, Mike, you made the point earlier and part of the discussions is that we're not looking at these opportunities as a way to get ahead of an economic environment. We're actually looking at these opportunities to actually operate really well regardless of the economic environment. And so the fact that you can get a great return off of that, in addition to making the company stronger, is terrific. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just on the Industrial business. Not that anyone should necessarily operate with a hard landing scenario, but thinking back to '15 and '16, I think some of the shorter-cycle elements of that and Tools and other Industrial Products caught you by surprise, and some of the decrementals there were a bit abrupt. How are you thinking about inventory levels, customer tone and kind of distance from prior trough in the context of 2019? It seems like everything's fine, and I'm not being overly alarmist here. Just trying to gauge what maybe the sensitivity looks like. Michael Lamach : Well, first, I mean, back to John's question, when you think about sort of where all this restructuring spend has gone, the bulk of it, to this point, has gone into the Industrial business, particularly in the compressor business. And so I think building a higher margin, more resilient business is certainly what they've been doing. The other piece of it is that service orders continue to outpace equipment growth, certainly again in Q4, too. And that there's both service penetration and it's share-of-wallet strategies for our CTS business. We believe that from what we're seeing here, there is certainly a balanced view toward what could happen. I mean, clearly, if there is some certainty around China-U.S. tariffs, we think certainty, no matter what the outcome of that could be, is probably going to lock a little bit of growth there. So I think it's a balanced view at this point in time, but I think we planned for a lower fixed cost base, restructuring through a higher service mix. And they've -- and that business has been prolific around investing back into the business. I want to say it was a full 50 basis points going back into Industrial, and I think that, that is always a sign of healthy business investing. In a downturn, you can take share. And we want to make sure if that happens, we're taking share in a downturn, too. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just thinking about some of these larger projects in Climate, I would imagine as the cycle wears on, you see more and more large projects show up. How should we think about that in terms of operating leverage when those ship? I would imagine some of that, especially in performance contracting, is some pass-through revenue, not just all your equipment. Is there a margin hit that comes in with that or a lower incremental? Or does it kind of feel like normal equipment? Michael Lamach : Yes. It can be, Josh. Not particularly in this case, right? I don't think this one's going to be something that spikes out materially anything with leverage or incrementals. So the margins on those projects are not bad. As we've talked in the past, you've got to look at the contribution margin to the entire business. Usually, those projects have everything, from an SG&A perspective, loaded into the contract as well. It's very little between contribution margin and operating income there left to look at. So I feel positive on that. Again, they're hard to forecast. We don't put them into base plans. And when we think we've got something that's got a high probability of closing, we might start to talk about it. And certainly when they're the magnitude of what we've booked, we'll have to spike those out so we get everything straight from a comp perspective. So I hope that answers your question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Yes. Can you guys hear me? Michael Lamach : Good morning. Andrew Obin : Just a question. A lot of questions have been answered. But just can you give us visibility on the institutional side because I know you guys look at state and local funding as foundations. How much visibility do you have for funding on the institutional side in HVAC in North America because it is a key market for you guys? Michael Lamach : There's a lot of metrics to look at there, Andrew. I mean, certainly, you all can look at ABI, GDP growth, non-resi fixed construction, all those look good. We've got the benefit of looking at... Andrew Obin : I'm -- I was more interested in -- yes. You guys track bond issuance and sort of longer-term metrics from the local government and state government. Those tend to be useful, sorry. Michael Lamach : Yes. We do as well, and you guys certainly can look at that. The most important thing we can track, though, is we've put a lot of investment into the systems we use in the front end of the commercial process. And so the ability for us to understand pipelines better really supports strong institutional growth going forward, and I could just tell you the number of and size of projects from the institutional perspective are very healthy. And this goes back to the question around 2019 in Climate, what confidence do you have. Or maybe even to the larger Ingersoll-Rand question, what kind of confidence do you have in the guidance you put out. And I've got a high degree of confidence on what we put out today on all of that. But I would say at the heart of that is because I feel very strongly about what's happening globally around HVAC compliance and certainly greenhouse gas emission visibility, around institutional growth in North America and around the visibility we have in the TK business. Those are all very strong indicators that I look back over 10 years of doing this, and I probably haven't had at least the visibility I've got now into the backlog. Andrew Obin : That's a great answer. And just to follow up on the industrial compressors, how much of a headwind is automotive for you? And if it is a headwind, which industries are offsetting this in North America because the orders are quite good as well? Michael Lamach : Yes, sure. Andrew, when you go back and you look at some -- sort of the pie charts that the business produces, one we do at Investor Day, and it shows the end markets that we serve, you run out of colors and slivers on the pie chart. So automotive is a piece, but it's probably not more than 2% or 3% of what we do. Electronics is a piece. It's not 2% or 3% of what we do and pharma and food and beverage and so on and so forth. So automotive per se is not critical, but it is indicative of a broader slowdown at times. It's indicative of the spending in the economy. So we watch automotive. And we see -- when we see automotive slow down, it could be a leading indicator for us, for sure. Andrew Obin : But what's strong in North America? Are there any end markets that stand out as strong to you guys on the Industrial side? Michael Lamach : Industrial markets that remain strong would be food and beverage. Pharma would be -- anything oil-free would certainly be strong for us. And then some of the weak to moderate markets are still going to be larger compressors where customers might be waiting on capacity to understand what's happening with trade. Operator : I will now turn the conference back over to Zac Nagle for closing comments. Zac Nagle : I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As always, Shane and I will be available over the coming days and weeks to take any questions you may have. So certainly reach out to us, if you'd like to chat. And we look forward to seeing you all at the upcoming conferences in February, and we'll be on the road in March as well. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.  This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.  Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to Slide 3 and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers all enabled by technology. Our business portfolio creates a platform for the company to consistently grow above-average global economic conditions aided by the strong secular tailwinds that I've outlined.  This morning we announced the transaction to separate our Industrial businesses by way of a spinoff to Ingersoll Rand's shareholders. And then combining it with Gardner Denver to create a leading global industrial company and to maintain our climate control assets to create a premier pure-play climate business. Our pure-play climate business squarely focuses 100% of our portfolio at the nexus of sustainability and impact where our products and services can have the most significant impact on the global challenges I outlined earlier. The press release and presentation outlining the transaction in detail is on the Ingersoll Rand website under the Investor Relations section. We also held a joint call with Gardner Denver management this morning at 8 :00 a.m. and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website. So I'm not going to spend any time discussing the transaction further on this earnings call. We will, however, be taking Q&A related to both our Q1 earnings and this morning's announcement during our Q&A session following our prepared remarks.  Moving to Slide 4. We're off to a strong start in 2019. Focused and consistent execution of our business strategy enabled us to deliver top tier revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth in the first quarter. We saw strong leverage from both top to bottom on the P&L with 8% organic revenue growth levering up to 27% EPS growth in the quarter.  We delivered another quarter of robust revenue growth led by our climate segment despite tough growth comps from the prior year quarter. Climate's 10% organic revenue growth in the quarter was as high as any quarter in the past 2 years and was compounded on 8% growth in the prior year. Industrial's organic revenue growth was up 3% offsetting good growth against the tough 9% growth comp in the prior year.  Headline bookings growth for the enterprise and for Climate of negative low single digits is driven by a significant year-over-year decline of bookings isolated to our Transport business, which I'll lay out in more detail in a minute. In order to more fully understand the health of the portfolio, we believe it is constructive to look at the underlying bookings growth trends in each of our key business units. For example, our commercial HVAC North America, commercial HVAC Europe, residential HVAC and Compression Technologies North America business reach up in the mid- to high-single-digit range in the quarter. China had flattish bookings in the quarter but still healthy when you consider the growth comp in the prior year quarter was in the mid-20s growth range. As we expected, Transport bookings were significantly lower in Quarter 1 after the extraordinary bookings growth we saw in every quarter of 2018.  As an example, in 2018, we booked 1.5 years of North America trailer backlog and 2 years of auxiliary power unit backlog resulting in record Transport backlog at the beginning of 2019. With the record backlog and continued underlying market demand, our revenue outlook for Transport looks healthy into 2020 with the key constraint being trailer manufacturers capacity. As you've seen, the ACT data is consistent with this view showing very high levels of demand through the forecast horizon, which goes out to 2020.  As I mentioned earlier, margin expansion was strong in the quarter with adjusted enterprise margins expanding 90 basis points. We're very successfully mitigating tariff and inflation impacts through price with the price versus material inflation spread of 70 basis points. Operating leverage was healthy at 26% and slightly ahead of our guidance for 2019 of 25%.  Overall, our end markets are healthy and performing largely as expected. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to monitor geopolitical uncertainties related to Brexit in Europe and tariffs and trade in China.  In Quarter 1, we also continued to execute our balanced capital deployment strategy. After investing in the business, we deployed approximately $380 million between dividends and share repurchases. Lastly, while still early in the year and with the cooling season on deck, we haven't seen anything through the first quarter that diminishes our confidence in our full year guidance. We're bullish on the effectiveness of our strategy, bullish on our end markets and bullish on our ability to execute in 2019. As a result, we're raising our annual guidance to the top end of our prior adjusted EPS range of $6.15 to $6.35 to approximately $6.35.  Please go to Slide 5. As we discussed in the previous slide, we delivered robust revenue growth led by our Climate segment with organic growth across all business units. We also delivered strong bookings growth in virtually all of our key businesses with commercial HVAC North America, commercial HVAC Europe, residential HVAC and Compression Technologies all up mid to high single digits. These results reflect continued strong execution of our strategy, capitalizing on healthy end markets.  Please turn to Slide 6. We've outlined a number of takeaways for each major business in the next 2 slides and you can read through those for some additional color. The most important thing I'd like you to take away from these slides, however, is that our outlook by key business is largely unchanged from when we gave guidance in January and we haven't seen anything that will cause us to change our outlook for the year at this time.  Turning to Slide 7. Again, we've added some comments to provide additional color on the slides and you can read through those. The key takeaway remains that we didn't see anything significant in Quarter 1 that would change our outlook for the year at this juncture. And now, I'll turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue? Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #8. I'll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we drove strong operating and financial results in the first quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $0.89, an increase of 27% versus the year-ago period. Our Q1 performance gives us increased confidence in our ability to execute against our full year growth and margin targets. As a result, though it's still early in the year, we are raising our full year adjusted continuing earnings per share guidance to approximately $6.35 at the high-end of our prior guidance range.  First quarter organic revenue growth was solid in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Bookings in healthy end markets grew 105% book-to-bill and generated record backlog for the enterprise.  Climate organic revenues were very strong, up 10%, building on a Q1 2018 organic revenue growth of 8%. Organic revenues were particularly strong in commercial HVAC North America and Europe. Transport organic revenues were also strong. Residential HVAC and China HVAC were up low single digits and flattish respectively, against tough prior year comparisons of low-teens growth and greater than 25% growth, respectively.  As Mike discussed, HVAC organic bookings were strong with mid-single to high single-digit growth rates for commercial HVAC North America and Europe and for residential HVAC.  In our Industrial segment, we delivered healthy 3% organic revenue growth compounding on a 9% organic growth rate in the prior year. Organic bookings growth was healthy in the first quarter with Compression Technologies North America bookings up mid-single digits. China growth was flattish with demand strengthening throughout the quarter providing cautious optimism going forward.  When we're with investors, we often get questions around free cash flow timing for the year. Consistent with typical seasonality, we are building inventory in the first half of the year to support the expected growth during the cooling season and we expect cash flow improvement to ramp in the second half of the year. Our free cash flow targets remain unchanged. Leveraging our business operating system across the enterprise, we continue to manage direct material, tariff related and other inflationary headwinds in the quarter. During Q1, we expanded adjusted operating margins 90 basis points and delivered 26% operating leverage slightly ahead of our full year expectations.  Importantly, we also delivered on our dynamic capital allocation strategy in Q1. We deployed $128 million in dividends and $250 million on share buybacks as our shares continued to trade below our calculated intrinsic value. Looking forward, we expect to consistently deploy 100% excess cash over time.  Additionally, our offer to acquire Precision Flow Systems was accepted by the seller during the quarter. Expectations for regulatory approval for the pending acquisition remains unchanged by midyear, 2019.  Please go to Slide #9. We delivered organic revenue growth of 8%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 90 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 27%. We drove strong organic revenue growth across all businesses and in virtually all products and geographies. Continued disciplined focus on pricing and productivity actions enabled us to effectively manage inflation and tariff-related headwinds and drive margin expansion across the enterprise. Please go to Slide #10. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter of operating income growth enabling us to drive solid year-over-year earnings per share growth in the quarter. Our Industrial segment delivered solid results that were negatively impacted by a supplier disruption in our small electric vehicles business. Excluding the disruption, Industrial adjusted operating margins were up 50 basis points. Of note, our full year Industrial margin outlook remains intact. Although the operating income line other expenses included expected pension cost increases plus a legal settlement related to a legacy business, which negatively impacted results by approximately $0.05. All in, we delivered strong 27% earnings per share growth in the quarter.  Please go to Slide #11. Strong execution drove 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in the quarter. Price versus material inflation was positive for the fourth consecutive quarter. Pricing expanded margins by 70 basis points reflecting strong carryover price from 2018 and incremental pricing actions in 2019. Consistent with our full year expectations, we delivered productivity to exceed other inflation. We continued to reinvest heavily in our business. Incremental Q1 investments of approximately 50 basis points were fairly evenly weighted between growth and operating expense reduction projects.  Please go to Slide #12. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter with 10% organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion of 130 basis points. Consistent with our expectations, results were strong across the segment.  Please go to Slide 13. Our Industrial business delivered solid organic revenue growth of 3% against a tough comparison of 9% growth in Q1 of 2018. As I mentioned previously, our Industrial segment margins were negatively impacted by a supplier disruption in our small electric vehicles business. Excluding the disruption, Industrial adjusted operating margins were solid, up 50 basis points. We expect the supplier disruption to be resolved during Q2 with full year Industrial margin expectations unchanged.  Please go to Slide 14. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects, which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership and margin expansion. We have a longstanding commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time.  We continue to make strategic investments and acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns like the pending PFS acquisition announced during the quarter. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and BBB rating that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We continue to see value in share repurchases when shares trade below their intrinsic value and in Q1, we deployed approximately $250 million.  Please go to Slide 16. With the extraordinary bookings in our Transport business in 2018, we thought it might be useful if we gave a bit of background on what drove the outsized orders and how to assess the impact to the overall enterprise. During 2018, high trucking capacity and the use of electronic driver logs drove strong demand for class 8 trailers throughout the year. Additionally, the tax law changes under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act further incentivized trucking companies to invest in their fleets. With such strong demand, OEMs experienced capacity constraints driving trucking companies to place orders months in advance. As the trucking companies placed preorders for trailers, they also placed preorders with us for trailer refrigerated units and auxiliary power units. As Mike mentioned earlier, we booked 1.5 years of trailer unit orders and 2 years of auxiliary power unit orders resulting in record Transport backlog at the end of the year. With a record backlog and an underlying healthy market, our revenue outlook for Transport is healthy into 2020.  Please go to Slide 17. Since Q2 of last year, we've effectively managed both material inflation and tariffs delivering price cost margin expansions in each quarter. With that track record, we frequently get questions around our price cost outlook for 2019 and I'd like to give you some background to understand how we expect the price cost to play out.  First of all, we're off to a good start in Q1 with strong carryover price from 2018 and incremental 2019 pricing actions, price cost delivered 70 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. As we move into Q2, our year-over-year pricing comps get tougher and by the time we get to the back half of 2019, we'll be lapping our full pricing actions from the prior year. Any incremental price at that point will be mainly from 2019 pricing actions.  For the inflation part of the equation, we expect continued commodity inflation in Q2. We expect moderating inflation in both Tier 1 materials and Tier 2 components in the second half of the year. During 2018, tariffs ramped throughout the year with the implementation of Section 232 tariffs followed by List 1, 2 and 3 Section 301 tariffs. As such, we won't fully lap current Section 301 tariffs until Q4 of this year. All in, we have successfully managed inflation and tariffs and we expect to continue to do so through purposeful active use of our business operating system. Next, we continue to expect 20 to 30 basis points of positive price versus cost in 2019. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Sue. Please go to Slide 18. In summary, we're pleased with how 2019 is shaping up. We expect to deliver strong revenue, EPS and free cash flow in 2019. Looking forward, we believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Our global business strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. The world continues to urbanize. We're becoming warmer and more resource constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers all enabled by technology. We have been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We have an experienced management team and high-performing culture that breathes operational excellence into everything we do. And lastly, we're committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital, and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to deliver strong shareholder returns over the years.  And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Mike, I was on the first half of the first call this morning and not the back half. I looked through some of the notes. But I was wondering if you could just spend a minute or 2 to kind of talk about the range of kind of strategic comparatives for kind of new Climate company and obviously, not mentioning things by name but where do you see the portfolio headed? What are some of the interesting opportunities maybe beyond the kind of excellent organic execution that you had? Michael Lamach : Yes, Jeff, first, to you and all the folks on the call today, thanks, we're occupying a lot your time today so thanks for the coverage and for following us. The answer to your question really the strategic comparatives don't change for Climate. The strategic focus around being able to really pinpoint the strategy, the investments and really create the most agile structure that we can come up with from a customer perspective is critical. And then, we'll continue to invest like we have in innovation and into the channel. So nothing changes. It's just a sharper focus on running faster and being successful. Jeffrey Sprague : And just a quick nuance on the separation costs. It appeared when GDI was mentioning the $450 million costs to achieve, they mentioned a $100 million separation costs for IR? A little confused by that. Are they somehow eating or absorbing the stranded costs associated with your side of the equation? Could you clarify that? Susan Carter : Yes, Jeff, no. That's not what they were intending. So the $450 million is the cost to achieve the synergies and then they have an additional $100 million that is their advisers and their cost to actually separate the Ingersoll Rand and include the Ingersoll Rand businesses and all their stuff. So in other words, they'll have tax and all of those things as well and then it came out that way simply because they're taking the name. But that is their cost, onetime cost of the transaction and the $450 million is the cost of achieving the synergies. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Mike, I know you want to keep this kind of more in the quarter and the outlook. But, again, I wasn't on the Q&A portion of the call this morning as well but a bit curious maybe I just want to see if -- when we look at the free cash conversion for the past 2 years, was there a significant difference between Climate and Industrial? And I'm just -- I guess, my question is how does the stand-alone Trane free cash flow looks on a global basis? Susan Carter : So the answer, Nigel, is there's not a significant difference between the Climate businesses and the Industrial businesses. So what we challenged the business is with and actually they deliver is achieving 100% of operating income as their operating cash flow. And then as I look through that and convert operating cash flow into free cash flow, again, they're both in sort of that 1% to 2% range on CapEx. From a tax rate perspective, I would call tax for Climate to be slightly on the lower end of our range and Industrial slightly higher. But what you end up with as I parse through all of that is that both of those businesses deliver about 100% of net income on free cash flow. Michael Lamach : Nigel, I would say that once we get closer to the actual effect of the spend and ClimateCo giving some guidance, clearly, that quarterly working capital will change a bit because of the seasonality of the business but other than that, Sue's exactly right on point with 100% or better conversion, which is the goal. Nigel Coe : Understood. And then just switching to resi, you've maintained a low- to mid-single-digit growth. It sounds like 2Q is still not okay. But if we maintain this kind of weather pattern through the summer, would we expect to be more in the low mid-single-digit zone? And then on top of that, have you seen any market share shifts so far this year? Michael Lamach : We've seen a good market so far this year and even with the weather being less supportive, it was still a good quarter for us. So good revenue growth in the quarter, good bookings, good margin expansion. New regulations I'm sure helping with that and also surprising opportunities on  new furnished regs. In terms of share, really if you look at any rolling 12 month period, pretty much any quarter over the last 4 years, we've gained share and we would have gained share again over the last rolling 12 quarters. So I think it will be for the fifth year in a row that we'll see pretty significant share gain again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Just to -- I wasn't also was not on the call this morning. I'm just curious as to the timing of this, I mean, I know that this is something that probably was evaluated several years ago when you split off Allegion. I don't know if somebody already asked it earlier in the morning but what was kind of the mindset around why now? Michael Lamach : Yes. I think that when you look at the company today, the dyssynergies that we see are about $150 million in terms of how we integrated the company from manufacturing and sourcing to engineering to shared services. And so spinning off a company without something of scale to merge with and develop synergies is a pure headwind. So when you find a situation like this, you got a $250 million synergy opportunity not including the growth side of this but $250 million on the cost side of this thing, it's really fully offsetting any headwind we have on the dyssynergies also avoiding that public company duplicate startup cost around that and then allowing us to really streamline the way we go to market in the Climate space, Steve. So it takes some timing, some valuations that work, the math has to work and it takes a willing and a good partner. It takes confidence on both sides that the management team going forward can execute on the strategies so that is our confidence in Vicente and the go forward Industrial company team as well as our confidence in the management team at ClimateCo being able to execute that. So all things point to the right valuations, right timing and the right partner to be able to effect a net positive versus a dissynergy number in the math. C. Stephen Tusa : What's the -- what's your updated thoughts on the, I guess, the daily question around HVAC industry consolidation? I know that your view in the past has been you can't kind of narrowly define it as just U.S. markets. Do you see kind of an open playing field here on that front? Or after further review, there aren't a lot of opportunities? Michael Lamach : Well, nothing's changed in our view that we've been talking about for 2 or 3 years around this in terms of the market and consolidation and what could happen between willing partners that want to do that. But I will tell you that strategically, it's the same place we were and we don't need to do something, we could if it made sense for shareholders. I think, we've got great optionality either way it goes. But it does create a much sharper focus and ability for us to think about being just faster in everything that we do from a customer, and from an innovation perspective. And -- I mean to me, it's really exciting to think about what's possible going forward as a -- is a sharper focus to a Climate company. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. So one last one. Can you just -- I know you don't want to give quarterly orders guidance but just should we just think about like the comps for the rest of the year? And a model that out, I mean, it can be lumpy. Is there any unusual lumpiness that you want to get out in front of for the second quarter just to kind of set expectations? I know the negative 3% was a little bit weaker than I was expecting. But just curious as to how you see the pipeline kind of playing out over the course of the year, if there's anything we should think about for second quarter on the Climate order front? Michael Lamach : Yes, Steve, thanks for the question. That's why we try to give a bit more color this quarter around the other pieces of this because when you think about the North American business both res and commercial, it was really an excellent quarter again mid- to high-single-digit growth rates. North America unitary particularly strong. We saw strength in office. We saw a strength in Industrial and a subset of that is really data centers driving that component. We see the manufacturing warehouses, labs as well. Applied, no surprise there that continues to be running incredibly well with great backlog and great order rates. Even China sequentially, and this would apply both to the Industrial businesses and the HVAC businesses showed sequential progress in the quarter where we came out of March with strong bookings and some healthy optimism around that. Europe was a little bit weaker but there's a lot going on and weaker -- I mean, Europe, and I think that from an HVAC perspective in Europe, we'll continue to capitalize on the mega trends that are driving growth outside sort of the general economy. But it has impacted things around Transport and some of the Industrial economy in Europe as well. The Industrial markets seem to be doing okay, as well. There again is some moderation in China, which we felt was positive. U.S. Industrial productivity remained strong. Capacity utilization's at record levels in the U.S. CapEx projections in the U.S. are low single digits so it supports our forecast there. In the EU, the PMI didn't decelerate further so that's I guess a bit of a win that had sort of plateaued, flattened. In China, PMI, it's still down again but it was up sequentially so things are looking better I think in China. Susan Carter : And Steve, if I can add a broad comment on top of the excellent color that Mike gave. If you think about Transport orders throughout 2018, they got tough comps going in all of those quarters. I would also say that if you think about the enterprise and where our growth came from in 2018, the second quarter, I don't care which business you have is a tough comp when you look at it. So again, that's not to indicate that we're not going to have great bookings growth but those tough Transport comps are going to be there and the second quarter was a particularly high enterprise type of growth in 2018. So tough comps. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe a first question on the incremental margins firmwide. I think you said they were around 26% in Q1. The year is 25%. Included in the guide though is the sort of moderation from price cost tailwind to margin. So maybe just explain what countervailing factors kind of step up through the balance of the year to offset that diminishing tailwind from a price cost? Susan Carter : So Julian, as you think about it, what is going to happen in actuality is you're going to start lapping the price in the second quarter. So in other words, the great pricing that we saw carryover from 2018 into 2019, we should go throughout the year. And you've got tougher compares on the overall pricing dynamic, which is why we talked about that price cost really sort of moderates as you go throughout the year and gets you back more into that 20 to 30 basis points spread type of environment. And again, you've got a first quarter we'll see what happens as we go into the cooling season but it really is the pricing comparisons and the material inflation sort of staying where it's at. Julian Mitchell : Sure. But does the -- maybe the tailwind from volume mix or the tailwind from productivity, does that step up later in the year? And that kind of mitigates the shrinking tailwind from price cost? Susan Carter : Yes, it's always the productivity. We're going to get more ideas as we go throughout the year and it does ramp up. So it balances throughout the portfolio between price and material inflation and productivity and other inflation. Michael Lamach : Yes, Julian, too, I guess, last thing I'd say is if there is place probably in the guidance where there could be opportunity, it's certainly in price cost, which we continue to surprise ourselves with what we're able to affect there and still continue to gain share in the process. So we're careful about that but that's going very well. Julian Mitchell : And then just the second topic. So you emphasized Transport order comps very tough throughout the whole year. That's very clear. And just on the revenue side of Transport, just wondered how you were thinking about that this year, maybe just parse out kind of expectations around the Americas and then I think EMEA, you'd thought about a flattish market previously for this year. Susan Carter : Yes. So I guess I would start the conversation by saying that with the amount of backlog that we build in North America trailer and in APUs throughout 2018 and again in the first quarter of 2019, we've got really solid footing on revenues going into 2020. So the only point on the tough comps was that there wasn't just 1 quarter of Transport bookings. So I would expect just as you said that we'll see strong North America revenues coming off of the backlog that we have in North America and APUs. Europe is going to be slightly impacted by Brexit and perhaps not as strong with the backlog and the overall orders. So now you say Transport's going to have a very good year in 2019 and 2020. Michael Lamach : Yes, Julian, I think one way to think about it is, it's a little bit like the Applied business. Right now, you're booking this -- in this backlog. You've got great visibility into it, when you take out the noise of the compares on the bookings because of Transport, you end up with this mid-single-digit revenue stream, which looks pretty solid through 2020. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So I want to piggyback on that price cost question, Sue. I just want to make sure I understand what's embedded in the guide for this year. And so at 1 point, I think even last quarter, you guys were expecting a step up of 25% on the tariffs side. So I wanted to make sure that, that was still part of the guidance. And then secondly, what are you anticipating from a pricing standpoint given moderating commodity inflation this year? Susan Carter : Yes. So as you think about how we thought about price costs going throughout the 2019 period is we obviously, had some tailwind coming off of the 2018 pricing. And we obviously, have left the tariffs that we put in the original guidance in. So they might have moved out a month and that might have created a little bit of less material inflation, if you will, in that guidance but it's not significant. So again, what we talked about when we gave the guidance and what we've continued to talk about is that if the tariffs don't materialize, our pricing will adjust. If the tariffs materialize, or they're greater or there's more inflation we'll adjust as needed, but the pricing that's in there is our normal pricing for what we see. And again, if the tariffs don't materialize, we'll not do price increases to cover something that didn't actually happen, if that makes sense. Joseph Ritchie : Yes, no, that makes sense. So I appreciate the clarification. And if I could piggyback on some of the order discussion that we've had so far, Mike, you mentioned in your prepared commentary that China commercial strengthened through the quarter. I was wondering if you can maybe just provide a little bit more commentary around what commercial HVAC did regionally throughout the quarter as we exited? Michael Lamach : Yes, I mean, starting with China, its demand strengthened throughout the quarter and it's a maybe testament to what's been happening with the direct sales strategy to drive those above market rates. In China, generally, we saw acceleration in even auto and pharma. So that was a positive. And it was less concern both in HVAC and in the compressor business around exporter activity. So it's certainly a more positive constructive environment there. The rest of Asia with the exception of Taiwan is pretty good for HVAC. So India, Indonesia, Vietnam, all -- Thailand, all positive. Just Korea is a bit weak for us there. Europe continued to outperform the market. It's not really so much connected to GDP as it is connected to the regulations and around some of the transformation there. We're doing very well in Latin America but it's difficult because if you think about the currency translation there, you get hurt in a lot of places but it's a healthy business in Latin America from an organic perspective. And the U.S, continues to be strong and I think will stay strong for the balance of the year in all aspects of the HVAC business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Congratulations on the deal. Great quarter. Just a question on orders not to beat the sort of horse to death. But given how tough the comps get particularly in the second half, should we expect a couple of more negative comps on orders this year? Overall orders turning negative for the company bookings? Michael Lamach : Again, first, it's hard, Andrew. We don't really forecast sort of that way around orders, it's really around the pipeline. So Sue, I don't know if you've done the math on that. Susan Carter : Yes, I think, Andrew, when you think about it. If you just did modeling with those comparisons, you've also got a large HVAC order that was in Q4. So if I pull that out as well as the Transport pieces, again, you're going to get enterprise bookings that are going to average out. So I don't really see an issue with that in the back half of the year. So what I pointed out to you is that Transport had heavy orders throughout the year in 2018 and tough comps but the overall business had a really excellent booking quarter in the second quarter but also the fourth quarter had the large commercial HVAC order. So if you take that noise out of there, I think we have very good bookings. And if you think about Q1, I mean, you had Q1 bookings that exceeded our revenue, the 105% ratio, that bookings ratio, book-to-bill ratio that I talked about so I wouldn't get concerned about that. I think it's just more color for your expectation. Michael Lamach : Yes, Andrew, I think to that point, add color, we'll just need to provide more color, so I don't think the story is going to be in the headline bookings, it's going to be understanding the health of the components and HVAC in a totally different trajectory and globally, on a different by region trajectory than it would be for Transport North America. We've just gone through heck of a boom here in the '18 and early '19 timeframe. So we'll give more color to help you understand that. Andrew Obin : And as I said, I also missed the Q&A portion of the earlier call but can you talk about given the more concentrated portfolio from HVAC, what's happening with the Mitsubishi JV and is there anything in your market in North America? Michael Lamach : Well, it's been a great success, the JV itself. So it's been something that I'm glad we did. In fact, I'm heading to Japan next week and look forward to sitting down with the CEO and going through the performance at this point but we couldn't be any happier with what has transpired at this point in time. But really in our view #1 in the market particularly where we participate together, we're #1. And the dynamics are the same where you're seeing good ductless growth in the U.S, slightly above the ducted revenues and you're seeing ducted revenues outside the U.S. and typically ducted markets growing faster than ductless revenue. So it goes to the theory that at the end of the day, it's going to be companies and channels that can sell a full suite of products and services that are going to win. So I'm very happy with that joint venture and I would say it's exceeding expectations. Andrew Obin : But effectively within this product category, you're going to do everything within the context of this venture within that technology, right? You're not going to do something by yourself? Michael Lamach : Well, we do a lot of -- by ourself today. I guess that probably helps to put some color on that. For really sort of the premium end of the market, Trane Mitsubishi is what we're going with. For the entry-level point in the market, we've got everything from making it ourselves, doing both variable refrigerant and variable waterflow systems along with ducted offerings in Europe, that we produce ourselves all the way through to some source product we use in various applications around the world. But when we think about the premium offering, that's going to be a Trane Mitsubishi offering for us. If there's a lot of segmentation here, which I appreciate the question because that is an important factor is understanding the segmentation of the market and make sure we've got a product and a solution for every part of the world and every price point that we need to plan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Cr?dit Suisse. John Walsh : Congratulations on the transaction announcement this morning. I guess, just thinking about the Industrial margin impact from the supplier disruption, should we put another $4 million in our model for Q2? Or would you expect it to be less than that? Michael Lamach : No, we killed that in Quarter 1. So no, we're good to go. I wouldn't put anything in the model that's not -- that's -- if that one's complete. Run the ground. John Walsh : Got you. And then, just thinking about the good growth we've seen in Climate last year, this year, over the last several years, I mean, how is the supply chain on the Climate side of the house? I mean, do you think -- are there pockets where things are stretched? Or do you feel very comfortable that there's -- you have all that taken care of? Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, this has been a factor, I think, competitively and I think we've been able to win by being able to have the capacity or at least change the playbook and have the playbook with different tack times to be able to hit different customer demand patterns. And so this was played out well and I'm really proud of what our whole team has been able to accomplish there. And it's been tremendous growth and we've wrecked the wall through that. With that being said, sure, I mean, you've got suppliers that are stressed and some situations where we're needing to pay extra -- needing to pay extra close attention and in some situations where we're needing where we can to be able to carry more inventory. John Walsh : And to maybe just one last quick one. I didn't hear any commentary around controls and what that did in the quarter and the trend you're kind of expecting there? Michael Lamach : Yes, services and controls are actually -- continue in both the CTS business and in the HVAC business globally exceed equipment growth rates. And the strategies there are working. And our controls growth rate continues to be kind of that the double-digit growth rate. And its not unusual, I mean, everything you're seeing in terms of products and systems today going as a system controls in our view is really part and parcel to a system that we sell. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Timothy Wojs : I want to extend my congrats on the deal as well. Just had a couple of cleanup questions here around Climate. So I guess, relative to overall segment margin expectations for '19, would you expect any of the sub businesses to have any sort of outsize margin performance in 2019? Or do you think all 3 subsegments expand margins kind of similar to the overall segment? And then secondly, what was price realization in Climate in the first quarter relative to the 10% organic growth? Michael Lamach : Yes, I think Tim, you're saying for res, commercial, and TK, do we expect margins to increase? And we do across all 3 of the sub portfolios in Climate. To your second question, I think we're looking for an answer on that. Susan Carter : On price realization? Zac Nagle : Yes, I think price realization was good. We wouldn't provide a specific breakout of what -- exactly what our price number is. Timothy Wojs : Okay. I guess, my first question was more of I think all 3 businesses will expand but is there any sort of outsize margin performance in any one of the businesses? Or should they all kind of expand at a similar level? Michael Lamach : Well, it's potentially, yes. If you ask the presidents running the businesses, they will tell you it's really outsized but from our point of view, they're all doing what they need to be doing and they're doing a great job. So no, there's nobody -- there's 3 gold medals, that's what we're going to hand out at the end of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Most of my questions have been answered but Mike, I'm wondering just a very big picture question around cyclicality of the global HVAC business. Obviously, some investors are thinking we might be toward the peak of the cycle, things continue to seem pretty good. You've mentioned a number of kind of secular changes whether it's Energy or regulations or anything like that. But just how would you encourage us to think about cyclicality of the remainder co as we go forward now with the next iteration of your life? Michael Lamach : Yes, well, I'd say cycles are not telling the story anymore, I mean, you've got to look at the regulations and what's happening in various parts of the world. You've got to think about 1 billion more people coming into the middle class and needing air conditioning and the demands on power in the grid and sustainability of all that. You've got to think that 15-plus percent of greenhouse gas emissions are happening through HVAC systems. And if you fast-forward and we do nothing about it, 25% would be through air conditioning in homes and buildings by 2030 on that larger population urbanizing. So the way to solve that I mean, is to do what we're doing. I mean we alone with the technology we have today that can cut out 2% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions just by doing what we're doing today by 2030. And you can imagine if 50 other companies join that, you wouldn't have a problem or at least the problem would be totally recast. So I think this is totally different. And then if I take it down to sort of ground-level today, I mean, this is why the services businesses are so critically important and wants to help counter these mini-cycles around what happens with office building or institutional in one part of the world or some geopolitical disruption in the part of the world. We're left to deal with those but long term, whatever those sort of mini-cycles are, the trend is up into the right about what needs to happen in the world between now and say, 2050 for that matter. Stephen Volkmann : Okay. That's good color. And then just 1 real specific one maybe for Sue. Is there anything that happens with respect to this transaction? Is there any impact on free cash flow? Or your ability to repurchase shares as we go forward? Susan Carter : So the answer is no, there is no impact on free cash flow and no, there is no restrictions on our ability to buy back shares if the price is below our intrinsic value going forward. No. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Just to follow up a little bit on some of the resi questions from earlier, understanding that there is a competitor out there who's kind of fighting to reclaim some share. How does that color your view on what pricing does over the balance of the year? And Mike, how do you feel about inventories in the channel right now? I know some of that is company-owned and you manage that but maybe from the independent side, what's your sense on loading levels versus normal? Michael Lamach : Yes, I mean, it is normal for us. If anything you might have seen, well, it depends on what competitor is launching the furnace platform when and when their pricing increases go into effect and you can get some disruptions from quarter-to-quarter. But the right way to look at that is not quarter-to-quarter, it's over a long period of time, a rolling 4 quarters makes a lot more sense on that. With all that being said, I continue to like our strategy. We've continued to penetrate the market with brands at various price points, with staying in front of regulations, with fully utilized very efficient plant and supply chain structures. So we're going to keep on doing what we're doing and competitors are going to do what they do but frankly, through the first quarter, everything looked great. I mean sort of price realization, cost position, bookings, revenue, there was nothing but positive news there from our point of view. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then just shifting over to commercial. Obviously, some great order intake especially in 2018. I think some large projects you called out, particularly in the fourth quarter, if I remember right, should we think about those converting a little lower-margin -- at a little lower-margin this year just given there's probably some third party source content, et cetera. And if so, what does that look like? When does that happen? Any color around what that margin mix when those hit, would be helpful. Michael Lamach : Yes, the easiest way to think about that is those larger projects really have the kitchen sink costed into them. So on a contribution basis, we're making sure it's accretive with the margins that we're trying to post from an op income standpoint. So the gross margins may be lower but you're really -- talking about all-in costs stand to execute. So I don't think you see any dip on operating margins. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : So I guess, maybe starting off with Climate. I know you guys aren't updating your organic growth outlook for the full year but obviously, organic growth came in really strong in the first quarter and so 5% to 6% is looking a little bit conservative for the full year, particularly since the comps don't really get a whole lot harder. So if you could just comment on the potential for Climate just to price to the upside throughout the rest of the year. Michael Lamach : Well, there's a lot of the year left. When you're talking about something less than 15% in the quarter, I think there's a natural hesitation to go out on a limb. I think it's given us the confidence to raise the top end of our guidance but I think we'd really need to see something more than the second quarter. You're really looking to see July and August to dramatically change that, Nicole. But I think the first leg of this is a lot of confidence in the first quarter to go to high-end of the range. That's not something we typically do. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Totally understood and definitely fair. And then I guess, the second one, just a tie-up question on the deal. So the synergy guidance that you guys have provided for the Industrial business, does that include PFS synergies? Or would those be separate? Michael Lamach : It's all in. It's assuming that PFS with our Industrial portfolio is merged into Gardner Denver and the total of all of the combinations is $250 million. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Add my congratulations. I just wanted to follow up on the question on PFS. And maybe this got covered in the Q&A earlier in the first call this morning. But is it fair to consider that PFS was the missing piece of the puzzle in order to qualify for the RMT? Michael Lamach : No. It wouldn't have anything to do with the RMT structure. I mean, the way that 2 important issues that would be looked at, it had to be looked at independent. So when you think about PFS being something that for a long time, we thought was a great fit with our Fluid business. We had to be prepared in that process, in that process' timing and to be successful. And then concurrently and somewhat in parallel as we are having discussions with GDI around the RMT structure, you're thinking about, well, look, if I'm successful one way or the other depending on timing, does it make sense in combination, if you will, the 3 businesses, GDI's business, PFS's business and our Industrial segment and the answer is, yes. So we felt like, look, we need to get after that asset because there's no guarantee that we come into an agreement with GDI and if that's the case, we're going to still build a bigger Fluid Management organization and go forward. And if we did, then it's going to be even more productive in terms of putting that combination together, particularly with their Medical segment, which is a lot in common. So we figured we couldn't really loose in that so we had to work within the processes we're working in. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. And then, is there -- are there any contingent liabilities or any encumbrances on Climate Remain-co and doing the RMT? I would imagine that if something were happen to the tax pretreatment, that would come back to the ClimateCo. Is there any -- are you restricted on any asset sales? Or just take us through some of those nuances? Michael Lamach : Yes, it's a -- the answer to your question is no, there's no restrictions to us but it is complex and nuanced and to have a full sort of discussion on this would depend on the situation itself. And it's probably best left toward the end of the transaction or maybe in some disclosures. But to answer your question broadly, no, there is no encumbrances or restrictions about how we run the company going forward. Deane Dray : Great. Just last one just sort of a structural question for Sue. Is it fair to say there will be 3 segments reported in the Climate company? Susan Carter : TBD, we'll do some work on how we want to structure all of that going forward, Deane. So don't have a definitive answer on that but we'll come back to you as soon as we do have one of those. I'd also like to add on your previous question, the tax-free nature of the spin is really a condition of the actual transaction closing, not anything that would impact the Climate business. And if the tax-free nature didn't happen, it would impact the transaction not ClimateCo. Just so you're clear. Michael Lamach : And Deane, maybe to piggyback on the segment question, I mean the way that we think about this is an opportunity to create an organization that is how we want to manage the organization, I mean how we want to lead the organization in an as efficient and agile a way as we possibly can. From that, some segmentation will pop-out of that but you've really got to go through the hard work of looking at all the designs going forward. Frankly, that's the exciting part of what we're doing. We really can take a clean sheet of paper and think pretty boldly about that and then however the segmentations spills out of that would be the way we run the business. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing comments. Zac Nagle : I'd like to thank everyone for joining today. And as always, Shane and I will be available in the coming days to take any questions that you may have. So have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and then a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website.  Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO.  With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. I'm proud of our team's performance in the second quarter. Once again, we delivered strong revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. We welcomed our new Precision Flow Systems team into Ingersoll Rand, and we're well underway towards a separation into 2 stand-alone businesses and our proposed strategic combination with our Industrial segment in Gardner Denver.  With that backdrop, let's get started. Please go to Slide 3. I'd like to start with a brief overview of the global business strategy that we're executing to deliver consistently strong financial results for our shareholders. Fundamentally, our strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact, which are strong secular tailwinds for our business. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource-constrained as time passes. We excel at reducing the energy intensity of buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Unless you think the world is getting cooler, less populated, less resource-constrained as time passes, these strong secular tailwinds will continue to provide opportunity for shareholders and purpose for our vision.  As we continue separation, integration planning and business transformation activities related to our strategy in combination of our Industrial segment with Gardner Denver, a move towards creating a premier pure-play Climate business in 2020, our aggressive pursuit of excellence in delivering solutions to mitigate the impact of these secular trends only intensifies. Our Climate business squarely focuses 100% of our portfolio at the nexus of sustainability and global environmental impact where our products and services can reduce the impact of these mega trends and create a platform for the company to grow above-average global economic conditions.  Moving to Slide 4. I'll spend a few minutes discussing how 2019 has progressed through the first half of the fiscal year and what we're expecting to see through the balance of 2019. The key takeaway is that we remain bullish on our strategy, our end markets broadly and our ability to execute using our business operating systems to deliver against our organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS guidance ranges for fiscal 2019. In fact, today, we're raising EPS guidance by $0.05 to approximately $6.40. We expect to deliver top-tier financial performance again in 2019. Commercial HVAC globally, and particularly in North America and Europe, has continued to be very strong for us, and our backlog, incoming order rates and sales pipeline give us confidence that this business will continue to deliver strong results in the second half of 2019.  Our residential HVAC business had strong mid-single-digit growth in the second quarter, and we expect this business to continue to deliver strong performance for the full year, supported by a solid residential replacement market. In our Industrial segment, we saw healthy order growth in long-cycle projects in our Compression Technologies business in the second quarter, and we have a favorable outlook for continued long-cycle growth in the second half of the year. Conversely, the short-cycle market softened in the second quarter, primarily impacting revenue growth in our core Compression Technologies and Tools businesses, which were both down low single digits. We expect short-cycle markets to continue to be challenging throughout 2019. The positive impact of healthy long-cycle markets presents a positive setup as we move into 2020 when these orders convert into revenue and operating income, given the long lead times associated with these projects.  Price realization has been outstanding across our businesses, and we're effectively managing all inflation and tariff-related costs with an 80-basis point spread in the second quarter. As we've highlighted before, we have been effective in managing inflation, and we expect to continue to maintain a positive spread at our target range of 20 to 30 basis points in the second half of the year, when we begin to lap the strong price realization in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 and when we begin to see the full impact of the increase in List 3 tariffs on Chinese imports moving from 10% to 25%.  Lastly, we continue to expect strong free cash flows in 2019 of equal to or greater than 100% of net income, which will further strengthen our balance sheet and enable us to maintain good optionality. We've deployed significant capital on dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases over the years, and again, in the first half of the year. We'll continue to follow our dynamic and balanced capital allocation priorities and expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time.  Please go to Slide 5. We delivered solid bookings and revenue growth in virtually all businesses and regions in the second quarter. On the bookings side, our largest HVAC businesses continue to lead the way and delivered strong growth, with North America and Europe HVAC up high single digits in the second quarter. China was also healthy with low single-digit growth against the very tough comp of low 20s growth in the second quarter of 2018. We also drove strong bookings growth of 8% in our Industrial segment versus a tough comp of 8% in the prior year, led by our Compression Technologies and Small Electric Vehicles. Compression Technologies' growth was driven by strong growth in long cycle, partially offset by softness in the short-cycle markets. Small electric vehicles' growth was driven by successful execution of our consumer vehicles strategy.  Transport refrigeration had a significant decline in bookings against very tough comps in 2018 for reasons we've discussed in detail in prior calls. However, as we've said before, these declines don't impact or negate the strong growth in our other Transport businesses or impact their ability to grow revenues in 2019 and '20. The transport refrigeration business had extremely strong bookings in 2018 and is returning to historically normal levels of bookings in 2019, but with backlog that is more than 2x historical levels. With the strong backlog and solid bookings we're seeing in 2019, we expect this business to deliver solid revenue growth in 2019, and the prospects heading into 2020 continue to look promising. On the revenue side, our largest HVAC businesses continued to deliver very strong growth with North America, Europe and residential all up mid- to high single digits in quarter 2. Transport refrigeration also delivered strong revenue growth.  Bringing all the pieces together, we're pleased with our organic bookings and revenue growth performance through the first half. We expect organic revenue growth rates to increase heading into the second half based on healthy backlog, deliveries and incoming order rates, and remain confident in our 5% to 6% organic enterprise revenue growth target for the full year.  Please turn to Slide 6. We've outlined a number of takeaways for each major business on the next 2 slides. Commercial HVAC continues to be very strong, particularly in North America and Europe. Our backlog, incoming order rates and pipeline of projects are driving confidence that we'll continue to see solid growth in the second half of the year. Residential HVAC had solid mid-single-digit growth in quarter 2, and we head into the second half of the year expecting 2019 will shape up to be another good year, led by a healthy replacement market.  I talked at length about transport refrigeration, which continues to be led by North America trailer, truck, APUs and aftermarket. Based on our record backlog and healthy incoming order rates, we remain confident that our Transport business will deliver another solid year in 2019.  Please turn to Slide 7. At our Compression Technologies business, we're seeing healthy growth in long-cycle markets and softness in short-cycle markets. The long-cycle business strength positions us well for good growth in late 2019 and in 2020 as these orders convert into revenue. Small electric vehicles is having a great year, driven by successful execution of our consumer vehicles strategy. And now I'd like to turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue? Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #8. I'll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we drove strong financial results in the second quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.09, an increase of 13% versus the year-ago period. Our Q2 performance gives us confidence in our ability to execute against the full year growth and margin targets we provided in our guidance in the beginning of the year. As a result, we are raising our full year adjusted continuing EPS guidance to approximately $6.40, up from approximately $6.35 that we communicated last quarter.  Second quarter organic revenue growth was strong, particularly in our Climate segment. We also saw strong organic bookings across most of our major businesses. When excluding our Transport business that saw outsized order growth in 2018, organic bookings were up approximately mid-single digits for both the enterprise and our Climate segment. In our Industrial segment, organic revenues were up 2%, compounding on a tough comp of 9% organic growth in the prior year. Strong revenue growth in CTS services and Small Electric Vehicles offset the weakness in the Industrial short-cycle markets Mike mentioned previously. Industrial organic bookings were strong, up 8% and compounding on an 8% growth rate in Q2 2018, fueled by long-cycle Compression Technologies growth and small electric vehicle demand. Despite ongoing trade and tariff negotiations, CTS China bookings growth continued to strengthen in Q2, providing cautious optimism going forward.  During Q2, we expanded adjusted operating margins 80 basis points and delivered 37% operating leverage, which is ahead of our full year expectations. We continue to leverage our business operating system across the enterprise to manage direct material, tariff-related and other inflationary headwinds. As we look to the back half of the year, we anticipate we will continue to realize price to effectively manage material inflation and tariffs, including the recent increase in list 3 tariffs on Chinese imports from 10% to 25%, but this spread should narrow as we lap the 2018 midyear price increases.  As Mike mentioned, we continue to expect strong free cash flows in 2019 of equal to or greater than 100% of net income. We exit the second quarter with working capital sufficient to support our ongoing cooling season demands, and we expect working capital requirements to approach the long-term target of approximately 4% of revenues by the end of the year. Importantly, we continue to deliver on our dynamic capital allocation strategy. So far this year, we have completed the strategic acquisition of Precision Flow Systems for approximately $1.45 billion, deployed approximately $259 million in dividends and approximately $250 million on share buybacks. Looking forward, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time.  Please go to Slide 9. We delivered organic revenue growth of 4%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 80 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%. Organic revenue growth was led by strong broad-based growth across our Climate segment. Continued disciplined focus on pricing and productivity actions enabled us to effectively manage inflation and tariff-related headwinds and drive margin expansion across the enterprise.  Please go to Slide 10. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter of operating income growth, enabling us to drive solid year-over-year EPS growth in the quarter. Our Industrial segment delivered solid results. Our full year Industrial margin outlook remains intact. In addition to good segment performance, second quarter corporate costs were lower than prior year, impacting results by approximately $0.05. The cadence of corporate expenses is lumpy in 2019, driven primarily by the timing of stock-based compensation that is not linear as well as the timing of a number of other functional spending items. The full year corporate cost guidance of approximately $250 million remains unchanged.  Please go to Slide 11. In Q2, strong execution drove 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. Price versus material inflation was positive for the fifth consecutive quarter. Pricing net of material inflation expanded margins by 80 basis points, reflecting strong carryover price from 2018 and incremental pricing actions in 2019. We delivered solid margin expansion from volume growth in the quarter. Margin expansion was tempered by softness in short-cycle industrial revenues, which tend to have higher margins. Consistent with our full year expectations, we continue to deliver productivity in excess of other inflation. We continue to heavily invest in our business. Incremental Q2 investments of approximately 40 basis points were fairly evenly weighted between growth and operating expense reduction projects.  Please go to Slide 12. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter of with 5% organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 basis points. Consistent with our expectations, we delivered strong volume growth, price realization and productivity. Please go to Slide 13. Our Industrial business delivered solid organic revenue growth of 2% against a tough comparison of 9% growth in Q2 of 2018. Industrial leverage was impacted primarily by the inclusion of the PFS acquisition midway through the quarter. PFS acquisition revenues lever at operating income margin rates instead of gross margin rates for the first year under our ownership. Additionally, as I mentioned previously, margin expansion was tempered by softness in short-cycle industrial revenues, which tend to have higher margins. Excluding these factors, leverage in Industrial was north of 30% in the quarter.  Looking at the EBITDA margins. The PFS acquisition was an immediate contributor to our EBITDA margin expansion of 60 basis points in the quarter.  Please go to Slide 14. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high-ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects, which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership and margin expansion. We have a long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. We continue to make strategic investments in acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns, like the PFS acquisition completed during the quarter.  Earlier this year, we secured an additional $1.5 billion in senior notes, taking advantage of the current favorable interest rate environment. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We continue to see value in share repurchases when shares trade below their intrinsic value, and we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time.  Please go to Slide #16. The integration of Precision Flow Systems with our existing ARO business is underway and is progressing according to plan. We expect PFS to contribute approximately $400 million in revenue on an annualized run rate. That equates to approximately $250 million of incremental revenue in 2019, with approximately $50 million already delivered in Q2. EBITDA margin expectations for PFS remain unchanged with percentages in the high 20s, and adjusted operating margins are expected to be in the mid-teens for 2019. PFS is expected to be cash flow accretive, consistent with the EBITDA attribution in 2019. For your reference, we have also included estimated non-GAAP adjustments related to PFS for the year.  Additionally, we completed a senior notes offering in March, which we anticipate will add approximately $60 million in interest on an annual run rate basis, $47 million incremental to 2019. For 2019, we expect the adjusted operating income of PFS to essentially offset incremental interests from the senior notes offering. Please go to Slide #17. I want to take a moment to further clarify the impact of PFS on our full year 2019 revenue guidance. As you can see on the chart, adding approximately $250 million of PFS revenues to our prior revenue guidance range increases our Industrial reported revenue growth rates by approximately 7.5 points and our enterprise revenue growth rates by approximately 1.5 points. There is no other change to our revenue guidance ranges for 2019.  Please go to Slide #18. When we are on the road, we often get questions about the status of the strategic announcement we made at the end of April to combine our Industrial segment with Gardner Denver. We continue to be excited about the prospects of creating a premier industrial company as well as a leading pure-play climate solutions company focused on HVAC and transport refrigeration. I'll give you a brief update today.  One of the transaction closing conditions was recently satisfied. The HSR Act waiting period expired. We will continue working through remaining regulatory and other closing conditions. We anticipate approximately $150 million to $200 million in separation and transaction-related costs, including the estimated cost of separating legal entities. We also expect to mitigate the approximately $100 million in stranded costs by the end of 2021. This is unchanged from what we communicated last quarter. In preparation for closing, we have begun 3 separate work streams. The first work stream is focused solely on the separation of our Industrial segment. After years of leveraging our costs, our Industrial and Climate segments, we have tasked the separation team with separating Industrial segment business processes, systems and functions. This includes technical and financial operating processes including tax and systems, manufacturing operations and supply chain services, real estate, along with all business regulatory filings. There is a lot of work to be done, and the team has a methodical roadmap to work this out.  The second work stream centers on integration planning with Gardner Denver. Given that we continue to operate as 2 separate companies and compete in the marketplace until the close of the transaction, the integration planning work must be managed under clear rules and antitrust protocols. While integration preparation is underway and will continue over the coming months in compliance with these rules, much of the work to integrate the 2 companies will take place after the expected close.  The final work stream is focused on the transformation efforts of our Climate segment. As we plan and execute within the transformation work stream, we have the advantage of building on an incredibly strong foundation, with great businesses, engaged and talented people and a distinctive winning culture and core values. Our strategy focus on reducing the world's energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions remains unchanged. We are focused on developing a new Climate structure that allows us to better serve our customers and unlock value for shareholders. At this point, this work is early on, and we'll give more updates at a later date.  All in, we're well underway on the strategic transaction, and we believe we are on track for closing in early 2020.  And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Sue. Please go to Slide 19. In summary, we're pleased with our first half performance and we expect to deliver strong revenue and EPS growth and free cash flow in 2019. Looking forward, we continue to believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Fundamentally, our strategy remains at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. Today, 15% of the world's carbon emissions come from heating and cooling buildings, and transport refrigeration creates another 80 million metric tons of CO2 emissions annually, which can be eliminated through electrification over time. We are bending the global warming curve by changing the way the world heats and cools buildings and moves refrigerated cargo. New technology we've developed can reduce up to 99% of the emissions that come from heating and cooling a commercial building. And this doesn't include the substantial environmental benefit of increasing system energy efficiency to reduce both power generation at the source and storage requirements.  We're continually working to innovate in this way to electrify heating, electrify diesel engines used to cool the trucks and trailers that transport perishable goods and to reduce the energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions in residential and commercial buildings.  We recently announced our 2030 ESG commitments to meet the challenge of climate change while increasing the access to air conditioning, perishable foods and medicines and improving the quality of life for people and communities where we operate and serve. We are committing to reduce our customer carbon footprint by 1 gigaton of CO2 through our HVAC and transport refrigerant products and services. We believe this is the largest customer climate commitment made by any B2B company, and our math shows that this reduction could equate to 2% of the world's emissions. The size and scale, that's equivalent to the annual emissions of Italy, France and the U.K. combined.  We continue to transform our supply chain and operations to have restorative impact on the environment, including achieving carbon-neutral operations and giving back more water than we use in water-stressed areas. We are committed to increasing opportunity for all, strengthening economic mobility and bolstering the quality of life of our people. This includes gender parity in leadership roles, a workforce reflective of our community populations, maintaining livable, market-competitive wages and broadening community access to cooling, comfort and healthful foods.  We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market position to enable consistent profitable growth. We have an experienced management team and a high-performing culture that instills operational excellence into everything we do. We remain committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital, and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to deliver top-tier shareholder returns over the years. Lastly, we're extremely excited about the proposed transaction and the strategic combination of our Industrial segment with Gardner Denver. Combining 2 of the premier complementary industrial companies offers the opportunity to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful revenue and cost synergies, supported by secular growth trends and diverse end-market exposure.  We're also very excited about creating the premier pure-play HVAC and transport refrigeration company with our existing Climate segment businesses. We have a tremendous opportunity to leverage a simplified business model and structure and sharpen our sustainability focus with our investments. Our Climate businesses have clearly differentiated performance, and we see significant opportunity as a pure-play to build on this performance for our employees, customers and shareholders. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : So I just wanted to ask on HVAC. What are you seeing in resi so far in July? And also on the commercial unitary front, how are trends in that part of the business this quarter? And what do you expect for the rest of the year there? Michael Lamach : Resi was strong in the quarter, bookings and revenue. While we think it continues for the balance of the year. We think the market might be low single digit, mid-single-digit, Steve. We think we'll be mid-single digit for the year there, so that's progressing. Again, as you know well, it's 80% replacement. We're heavily indexed there. And anything we do incrementally with new construction is actually an add. It's growth for us, so we feel like we're in a great position. With regard to Commercial North America, we're seeing strength in unitary. We're seeing strength in applied services. We are seeing, particularly verticals, like K-12 labs and the data centers that are growing nicely. So no let-up there. And then just to anticipate some questions I think that people may ask, if you think about our backlog today across the globe from HVAC perspective, we're up 21% year-over-year and even up sequentially from quarter 1 to quarter 2. So that is, I think, indicative of just continued strong markets and a solid pipeline going forward. C. Stephen Tusa : Great. And then so you think you guys are taking share. It sounds like some of the other guys have put up numbers that are obviously not as good as that. Michael Lamach : Well, in the markets that we get really good data, third party was just the easiest to look at. Absolutely, that's a fact, yes. C. Stephen Tusa : And then lastly, just third quarter, can you talk about seasonality? Do you expect normal seasonality here in the third quarter? I know things are moving around in the global economy. And also orders. Do you think orders are going to take kind of another step-down? Or how do the compares look so that maybe we're more stable here in low single-digit type of number for Climate? I know you don't like to guide that, but there's obviously a lot of moving around in the economy. I'm just curious as to how you guys see that playing out. Michael Lamach : Well, I don't see any changes, really, in HVAC globally. I think we've got a pretty good read on the global landscape. Most markets are strong, and there's pockets where there's weakness, but surprises where markets are strong. Example of that would be Mexico has gone through a couple of quarters of negative GDP. It's a pretty big market for us. So that's the newer information. But we're relatively strong in an equivalent market in the Southern Cone, Latin America. So it's that sort of thing on the edges that we're looking at. But the markets remain strong. There's a lot of focus on Thermo King. I think we've done a decent job explaining the constraints that exist in 2018 at Class 8 tractors and how customers wind up in advance really to pull on that supply capability. It translated down through trailers and, of course, that all translated to those customers ordering either APUs or our refrigerated trailers. The actual takt time of how the heartbeat of a plant runs and we match trailers and units to actual tractors or trailers. It's very smooth. And that backlog generates just mid-single-digit revenue growth that's been pretty consistent. So noise is around the TK bookings. But again, I think you just have to separate that from the 28 constraints with our customers and think more about HVAC market being strong and Transport just generating solid revenue growth and good backlog and generally healthy markets. And we're still seeing good order intake rate at Transport. So it's not as if things are drying up even on the order input side there. Just tough comps. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Julian Mitchell : So maybe just sticking to the 2-question rule. My first question would just be around the Industrial division. It looks like, on Slide 17, you're still assuming maybe 5% organic growth this year. That seems to imply a step-up from the first half. So maybe just help explain why you think Industrial organic growth should reaccelerate in the second half, please. Michael Lamach : Yes. I think we've got our eyes wide open in the short cycle, and we've accounted that in our forecast. We had strengthened longer cycles, some of which we expect to shift in the fourth quarter. A lot will shift into 2020. We have excellent growth in our consumer strategy related to Small Electric Vehicles. So -- and Julian, we've just finished the 5 plus 7 forecast not even a month ago. We had an opportunity to update that last month, risks and opportunities. I think that we feel pretty good about that forecast. When I look back at the beginning of the year relative to guidance, I would say that Climate markets are trending toward maybe the upper end of that, and Industrial markets maybe would be trending to the lower side of that. But net-net, we feel like we're right where we need to be in terms of the guidance that we gave. Julian Mitchell : Then my quick follow-up would be around the Climate division. You had about 7% profit growth in the second quarter, a bit of a step-down from Q1. And then you're sort of guiding for a pickup in the second half. Similar question, I guess. What drives you to think there's slightly better EBIT growth in the second half? Maybe it's actually with the resi versus commercial versus Transport or something on the margins around price of material? Any color at all on that aspect. Michael Lamach : Yes, Julian, I mean, when you look at leverage, first of all, in the quarter, we actually had really good leverage. We had leverage above gross margins there, north of 30%. We were able to be right about 30% for the first half of the year. So the question probably relates to what you're thinking to be a step-down in the revenue. But again here, when you look at 21% year-over-year backlog and sequentially improving backlog from quarter 1 to quarter 2, knowing deliveries and the service business being about half of the business, the amount of book in turn we need to do is actually as small as I can remember it. So again, we feel pretty good about the revenue number, and I think that, that segment, in general, leverages pretty close on the full year at the 25% rate we guided to originally. So I'm not seeing a lot of weakness there. Operator : Year next question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : Sometimes when you are executing a kind of a deal like this of this size, there tends to be a little bit of a letdown ahead of closing. And some companies, we see they have to adjust compensation plan and such to prevent that. But have you guys -- do you feel the need to do anything? Have you done anything? Is there a risk that there's a little bit of a distraction amongst the operating heads walking into the back half of the year here? Michael Lamach : We've got, over the years, a wonderful operating system that in terms of the metrics and early warning indicators that we would get, Scott, we feel good about seeing that. Of course, we're seeing none of it today. But the more important thing we're doing, though, is organizing ourselves in a way that we can compartmentalize what needs to happen and then think about interdependencies between things. So as an example, our #1 priority is to run the business and run it well every day and execute on the commitments we made. The second priority is the separation itself. Of course, there's no integration without the separation. So there's a separate team focused on separation that does not involve the integration team, which is the third priority. The third priority around integration is, to the extent we can under the rules of engagement, is to support GDI's lead in that effort. So that continues. And the fourth thing that we're doing is using the opportunity, the value stream map, much of the company and core process to customers and use the opportunity to think about those core processes in a way that we can make sure that the maximum value added to customers is being delivered and how we might structure from that output. And with that, what might it mean, and of course, the cost structure to maybe speed to market in some cases. It's pretty exciting. But we've tried to make sure that the teams are different people, to the extent we can. Of course, a group like Takt's is going to be related to all 4 of those activities. But we're doing a pretty good job of compartmentalizing that and running it and using the metrics that we've always used to run the business. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And just as a quick follow-up, and this -- I know this is always hard to answer, a question around market share on the HVAC side. But sometimes, I mean it's clear that you're gaining share, but sometimes, that's due to geographic mix or the type of projects that are growing. I mean is there kind of a no-BS answer to that question of why you think you're winning. And not the usual or better than the rest kind of stuff. But is there any other explanation that you can give that can be helpful in that regard? Michael Lamach : We've really designed, really, our technology and go-to-market strategy around sustainability and around eliminating both the emissions and reducing inefficiencies. So this passion around having the most energy-efficient commercial systems out there in the world today; using the most responsible refrigerants that we can put into these systems, leveraging the analytics, the data, the controls around that to put more sophisticated service offerings together; the belief that on the commercial side, we need to be doing that ourselves, not through independent distribution because of the complexity of what it takes to model, sell, service, deliver against those plans. That's been our strategy and we've been consistent about that and just executing hard against that. I think from a goal deployment perspective, another core part of the operating system, there's no mystery in the company as to what our goals are, what's expected, what we're measuring. So that -- it's just coming together in a way that has worked, Scott, over a long period of time. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : So I guess just going back to the price/cost spread. You talked about, the 20 to 30 basis points here in the back half. I guess I understand the tariffs, but just kind of looking also at recent price increases, and I realize they're not all created equal, it does look like you pushed through some kind of another round of healthy price here across the commercial parts of your portfolio. I mean is that -- should we view that as kind of a conservative placeholder for the back half? Or is there something else that would kind of make that decelerate further? Susan Carter : John, what I would say is when you think about how we called price/cost for the year, we're basically in line with how we called it. So we knew that we were going to have some great price comparisons on a year-over-year basis in the front half of the year, and we knew that in the back half of the year, we were going to lap some comparisons to last year. So price is going to actually be -- it's not a deceleration at all, but the comparisons to price in the back half of last year are going to result in a little bit less of a spread than in the first half of the year. But in terms of expectations, that's exactly what we would have expected. The prices are going through. They are sticking. They are truly being realized in the business. And material inflation is actually doing approximately what we thought it would do for the year, which is we've got the tariffs covered. We've got all of the elements of costs covered, and we're seeing a little bit of material stabilization. But again, stabilization to our expectations in the back half of the year and a little bit of deflation, but given the way that we buy materials, probably more of a 2020 impact. So when I think about the whole price/cost and sort of put it in the basket, I think the price comparisons are more difficult in the back half of the year than the front half of the year. Material inflation is doing about what we expected, and that gives us roughly the 20 to 30 basis points of spread for the entire year on price/cost. I mean maybe it's a skosh purse-conservative. But it looks about like we thought it would look, which is the really good part of that. John Walsh : Okay. And then I guess just as a follow-up, if we could maybe look at the Americas or maybe, actually, drill down into the U.S. versus China. Just what you saw in terms of service versus equipment growth in the quarter? Michael Lamach : Yes. Both are progressing well there, John. Always surprised at the degree of service penetration in China, how quickly that's maturing. So there's really no surprises there. And from a service perspective, we continue to do well there. So not much more to say there. Obviously, the U.S. and Europe are the gold standard around penetration and linkage. And then China is quickly, over the years, coming to that point. And over the next 5 years, I think it will be at the same level as our North American and European penetration. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : I want to turn back to Industrial and the long-cycle bookings growth that you called out, and -- I mean I think we're all sort of thinking CapEx being kicked down the road, perhaps some of these projects pushed out. But where are you seeing the bookings strength? Will you call out any end markets in particular? And then switching to the shorter-cycle pressure you've seen, would you say that's mainly inventory reductions or genuine end-markets turbulence? Michael Lamach : Yes, Nigel, I would call it, Asia, in your first question, probably, to be -- we're seeing the long-cycle bookings. And here, you're seeing chemicals, manufacturing, energy. Susan Carter : Air separation. Michael Lamach : Air separation would be another, for sure. So that will be what I'd point out there. With North America, with the U.S. in particular, there was a slowdown, it seemed, after there was a flurry in the USMCA discussions between Mexico and the U.S. on the possibility of U.S. imposing additional tariffs if Mexico wouldn't secure the borders from the Mexican side. Roughly after that, we saw a slowdown. I think it was certainly an end-user demand, and that obviously affects the sell-through of distribution of short-cycle products there. And it's bounced around a little bit but off kind of that lower level. So hopefully, all that, I guess, cleaned up permanently and I think that will have a restorative impact on the short cycle when it does. I think it will be a nice bounce up when there's certainty around that. Nigel Coe : And then just digging back to the North American commercial as a quick follow-on. I think some of the peers saw weakness within the commercial unitary markets, in particular, on the replacement side and weather impacts we've called out there. Did you see that as well? Would you call out the light commercial as weaker in North America? Michael Lamach : No. Nigel, it was exceptionally strong for us. So no. I would say it would be the highlight of the quarter as opposed to a weakness. I can't tell you why we'd be different, but I can tell you it was a standout in the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Mike, you never liked to mention whether -- and Nigel just threw it out. I mean anything in the resi business that you thought was discernible? And you run your inventories pretty lean, but is there anything kind of in the early setup in the third quarter, an overhang from that, that would be of note? Michael Lamach : No. It was a little bit last year of some prebuy. I think it got pulled in, in the second quarter. That's really the only kind of -- it wasn't a big number, but it was a little bit of a compare -- a difference there. I think a number of companies said that happened. So no not really, Jeff, to answer your question. I think it's just fundamentals remained strong. I think that consumer generally still feels good, pretty healthy, and we're not seeing any changes to that. Jeffrey Sprague : Bigger picture, Mike, I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on what you mean by transformation, right? I think the idea may still be kind of coming into view, but it seems like you've got a relatively crystallized view of where you want to take things. It'll just be interesting to get a little bit more perspective now, kind of 3 months since making the announcement kind of what you're thinking about kind of pure-play transformation. Michael Lamach : Yes. The starting point, just to be clear, is something that we're all very proud of over 10-plus years. And so transformation does not mean, if there's something bad, it's something good. It means there's an opportunity here to really go think -- obviously, from a name and a brand, all the way through the simplification of legal entities, the way that we might look at the way that support services have performed across the company, we will apply the same value stream mapping that we would do in a manufacturing process to the way record to report, or procure to pay, or any kind of order the cash process would work. We'll look through our field organization and understand how that would pan out in terms of incentives and some of the metrics that are out in the field. And just make sure that those are where we want them to be. There's likely different structures that will evolve when you answer those questions. And I think with the goal toward customer focus, a goal toward simplification, being tighter on some of the investment focus on our core sustainability themes. All those things I think are exciting to people inside the company because we're building off a piece of -- a strong foundation. Operator : Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Gautam Khanna : Just to follow-up maybe on Jeff Sprague's question. You mentioned the year-over-year on orders, the pull forward last year. But just speaking about Q2 '19, did you see any difference on the resi HVAC side between your indirect and direct channels? And maybe if you can speak to -- Lennox, on their call, talked about being over-indexed to some of the swing regions in the U.S. where it can be hot or cold, and so weather was particularly uncooperative given their exposure. I mean how does your footprint kind of contrast with that, if at all? Michael Lamach : Yes, I can't really contrast it to anybody else, but I can tell you, we're about 50-50 direct and indirect. We really didn't see any difference in order rates there at all. I guess in 45 or so earnings calls -- I can't remember, I don't think I've ever used weather as a strategy or as an excuse. So I can tell you weather normalizes very quickly often within a year, with a bias toward a warming planet. There's more degree days in the future, not fewer. So it's a great place to be, and we like the footprint that we've got. Our focus is on market share and margin expansion as it is for every product growth theme we have inside the company. So those are 2 clear goals that we have, and that doesn't change. Gautam Khanna : That's helpful. And then just as a second question. Maybe can you give us some color on your expectations for Thermo King growth next year, given what we're seeing in the truck market and what you have as offsets with the APU penetration, and like you said, the backlog running into next year? Any preliminary view on that? Michael Lamach : Yes. It's too early on that. I mean we'd like to see the update that's coming out around Class A. We'd like to see the updates coming out around refrigerated trailers to know that. My sense is there's no way to burn off all of the backlog we've got in '19. I know we're into '20, as it stands. Order rate is still healthy. So just a really early view, which was the same view we gave last time, is when you normalize the '18 bookings over a '19 and '20 revenue cycle, I think you get kind of the steady takt coming out of the business of mid-single-digit growth rates. So I would have no reason to deviate from that at this point. In fact, Gautam, I hope, depending on how sort of Brexit really unfolds and unwinds, that next year, we're sort of getting through this low point in Europe. And potentially, we're seeing strength in Europe, which has been markedly slower than North America as a result of just what's happening with the broader European economy. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Just a question. There's been a lot of articles. I think the Wall Street Journal had an article how the Europeans are still reluctant to embrace HVAC, even despite sort of climate change and the heatwave that you're seeing in Europe. What kind of conversations are you having with customers in Europe regarding HVAC? And are you seeing any structural changes in adoption rates? Michael Lamach : Yes. I think you're largely thinking about what consumers might think. But if you think about any institutional building, any data center, any industrial building in Europe, they've got the same requirements that you've got all over the world. And I would say the booking rates there, for us, for multiple years have been extraordinary. We've said, I think in '16, that we would double the business by 2020, and we're going to definitely do that. So I look at economy there, that even though it's modeling around kind of flattish, we've had bookings growth and revenue growth that's been in that high teens, low-20s range now for multiple years. But we're not focused on the consumer there per se. Although there is an extraordinary opportunity, I think going forward around the electrification of heat in Europe, as you'll see more of that application as opposed to the problems of boilers in Europe over time. When that happens, I do think we've got a business and a product portfolio that will benefit from that regulatory conversion in Europe to electrification of heat. Andrew Obin : No, I think I was referring more, if you visit office buildings in Europe in August, they certainly have a different idea of what HVAC is versus North America. So I was wondering if requirements are changing. But we can take it off-line. Another question is on supply chain. Are you guys rethinking where and how you're spending CapEx, given all the uncertainty that's taking place? Michael Lamach : Are you meaning uncertainty in the economy? Uncertainty where? Andrew Obin : No, I'm thinking about it, but I'm thinking trade uncertainty. And are you thinking -- are you changing where are you spending CapEx globally? And are you sort of having conversations with your supply chain about moving some sources? Michael Lamach : Yes. When we think about our CapEx, there's been little difference to how we think about it because we want to make things where we sell things, and that's generally what we've always done. And I would say there's even a stronger concentration of that than it was 5 years ago. That's been our strategy. As it relates to the supply chain, it depends. Where there is an easy answer, yes, we'll look for an opportunity there if we can, and we've made some movement there. So the answer to your question is, from our own footprint perspective, we're continuing to do what we do from a supply chain perspective. Around the edges, there's things that we do to move supply where we can. Andrew Obin : Great. Always nice to have an HVAC company that doesn't blame weather. Michael Lamach : Andrew, just a bit on your question. I'm just going to follow up, I know you're off the line here. But it's interesting a, lot of the Chinese customers that we have that we're looking to move production away from China to maybe avoid some of the U.S.-China tariffs were thinking about Mexico as well. I think that some of what they've done and decided has changed over time, and I think we're seeing more in areas like Vietnam, as an example, as opposed to Mexico. So there are changes with our customers in terms of how they're working their footprint for sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Nathan Martin from Seaport Global. Zac Nagle : There's no Nathan in the call queue. I think you've got the wrong person. Operator : Your next call is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : So maybe my first question, Mike, just focusing on Climate operating leverage for the quarter. And so obviously, like price cost came through well. It seems like the leverage is maybe a little bit lighter than we expected. Was there anything that impacted Q2 just from a mix perspective on the Climate side? Anything out of the ordinary? Michael Lamach : So Joe, I've got 32%. Were you expecting more than that in the quarter? Joseph Ritchie : Yes, then my assumptions on price/cost must be slightly different. Michael Lamach : Okay. I'm just taking $40 million of operating income on $124 million revenue rise, and that's what I'm looking at. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. All right, I can take it off-line. I was trying to surf out the price/cost component and trying to really determine what the volume leverage was. And it seemed like it was a little bit lower than anticipated. But that's okay. And then I guess maybe just kind of sticking on the commodity, the price/cost question and, Sue, your comments earlier on it being a skosh conservative in the second half of the year. I guess as you're thinking about commodity inflation in 2H, if you look at copper, copper still are going to be pretty depressed. You guys typically will buy ahead of it. So I guess where were you locked in for copper for the second half of the year? And I guess, what are the kind of -- what are the offsets, potentially, to a copper tailwind in the second half of the year? Susan Carter : Well, Joe, if you remember, we actually -- when we gave our original guidance for the year, we had actually planned on both copper and steel perhaps having less inflation in Q3 and Q4, and that's basically coming true. So if you think about copper specifically that you asked about, we're about 75% locked for the back half of the year, which is typical for us. Where you'll see the benefit of those spot rates on copper that really have come down is really in 2020, as I said. So we're doing buys every month for -- whether it's for 2019 or for 2020. So you'll see the advantage of that appearing in the 2020 numbers. And pretty much the same thing on steel. We know what we're paying for steel about 6 months in advance. And with either one of those commodities, the highest spot prices were in Q1. They started to come down in Q2, and they'll -- the spot rates that we see right now are down in Q3 and Q4. But again, that's more to our expectations. I don't expect that to be a huge tailwind in the back half of the year. On the other hand, the good news is, is it's not actually a headwind like we've seen for the last couple of years. So like I say, we're taking advantage of it with our buying processes and with our supply chain each and every time we buy the commodities. But it actually is performing about like we expected and called for during the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, just following up on China HVAC. Last quarter, you basically were flattish in terms of order growth, and this quarter, up modestly against the tough comps you mentioned. As in last quarter, you were seeing, generally, the demand improved throughout Q1. So did you see that improved demand level of at all in Q2 as other industrial companies are seeing, or do they generally steady or even improve in the quarter? Michael Lamach : I would say, in both Climate and Industrial, from March forward, bookings have steadily improved in China, specifically. And -- but the markets have shifted. As an example, electronics would be down, say, 15% as a market, but you're going to find other markets that have been compensating for that in some of the heavier industries that would have compensated. And steel would be an example there, something that's -- or power generation, where there's a market both for Industrial and for process cooling in those markets. So that's been good. Yes, we're stacking quarter 1 and quarter 2 '19 against plus 20s kinds of comps in quarter 1, 2 of '18, so the stack in that is sort of still mid -- kind of low to mid-teens growth over the 2-year period. So we're happy with kind of what's going on in terms of the strategy there that we had around the direct sales force that we've put in place. And then we're happy with the linkage, the service there. China is slower than it was historically, but still a pretty good market. And there's a focus not quite as strong as Europe around sustainability, but certainly, as I've talked in the past, much more of focus in China around clean air and clean water. That's having a positive impact on what we do. Andrew Kaplowitz : That's helpful, Mike. Mike, you gave us a good clarity on PFS. But could you give us more color on how it's doing as it entered the Ingersoll portfolio? Obviously, a fair amount of industrial and, obviously, more oil and gas exposure there. So have you seen any slowdown in that business versus your initial expectations? It will be helpful if you could just talk about how it's coming in so far. Michael Lamach : Yes. Let me start by saying, first of all, from a cultural fit and a performance mentality, from our goal deployment process, from -- I feel like these guys have been here for years, which is fantastic. It's a great fit inside the company. And in terms of achievement of their management plan, they're on track with that. So the mix has changed a little bit, and you see that in some of the shorter cycle, but like the rest of Ingersoll-Rand, they've got kind of measures for how they're dealing with changes. So frankly, it's been positive. Sue, do you have any comment on that? Susan Carter : Yes. It is actually a refreshing type of business because they do have several different brands that they operate under and several different end markets that they go to, and the management team is excellent at finding a real balance between the opportunities in the portfolio and the risks in the portfolio. And they are operating to the management plan that we used when we bought the business, which is great news, both revenue, operating income as well as cash flow. Michael Lamach : And Andy maybe some -- just to give you one point of specificity here, positive bookings growth in the quarter against if you think about sort of all the food management peers that are out there, that I think are booking negative. We're very proud of that. Operator : I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle for closing comments. Zac Nagle : I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. And we -- Shane and I will be available for questions over the next day or 2, and then in the coming weeks. So if you're interested in having a call, please give us a call, and we'll schedule some time. We look forward to seeing you soon on the road. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Denise, and I will be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please begin. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made on today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release.  Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. I'd like to start out today's call with a brief overview of our global business strategy that's enabling us to consistently deliver strong financial results for our shareholders. Fundamentally, our strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact, which has strong secular tailwinds for our business. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource-constrained as time passes. At our core, we are focused on and excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. And lest you think the world is getting cooler, less populated and less resource-constrained as time passes, these strong secular tailwinds will continue to provide opportunity for shareholders and purpose for our vision. As we continue separation and integration planning activities related to the combination of our Industrial segment with Gardner Denver and transformation activities related to our move towards creating the premier pure-play Climate business in 2020, our aggressive pursuit of excellence and driving solutions to mitigate the impact of these secular trends only intensifies. Our Climate businesses squarely focus 100% of our portfolio at the nexus of sustainability and global environmental impact, where our products and services can reduce the impact of these mega trends and further advance the platform for the company to grow above average global economic conditions.  Moving to Slide 4. We continue to deliver strong financial results by effectively managing through an evolving global landscape. In the third quarter, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth and 14% adjusted EPS growth, compounding on tough comps of 10% organic revenue growth and 22% adjusted EPS growth in the third quarter of 2018. We remain bullish on our strategy, the opportunities that lie ahead in our end markets broadly and particularly on our team's resilience and their ability to execute using our business operating system to deliver against the top-tier organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS guidance targets we provided for fiscal 2019. We continued to deliver strong and differentiated performance in Q3 in our Climate segment globally. Climate segment organic revenues were up 8% against a tough comp in 2018. Our global HVAC business performance was particularly strong with approximately 10% organic bookings growth and approximately 10% organic revenue growth. Our performance was also broad-based with North America commercial HVAC, European commercial HVAC and residential HVAC all significantly contributing to the growth.  Our backlog, pipeline and order rates continue to be solid and support healthy growth through the fourth quarter. This is reflected in a revised full year Climate segment organic growth guidance of 7% to 7.5% revenue growth, which is a full point above the top of the prior guidance range. Delivering strong Climate performance has enabled us to effectively offset persistent softness in global short-cycle industrial spending, which drove organic revenue declines in our short-cycle industrial businesses mainly in Compression Technologies and tools. In 2019, long-cycle larger compressor orders have shown more resiliency than small- to midsized short-cycle compressors, and we're building a solid backlog for these products year-over-year. However, the majority of these units won't ship or deliver meaningful revenues until 2020 and 2021. Despite revenue declines in our high gross margin Compression Technologies business, the steps we've taken to restructure and fundamentally improve our operations and service mix over the past several years enabled us to manage the deleverage of the business within our gross margin target rate, demonstrating what we believe is a more resilient business, better able to weather economic downturns.  In Transport, we delivered low single-digit revenue growth in the quarter against a tough comps in 2018. We also expect revenues to moderate some in the second half versus the first half, again comparing with tough comps in the second half of 2018. Further softening of the European economy, combined with ongoing Brexit uncertainty, has softened our European trailer outlook for the back half of the year for the region, but we expect this to be largely offset by strong North American revenues for 2019. Our outlook for mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in 2019 for our overall Transport business remains unchanged. We continue to effectively manage tariff and inflationary headwinds and deliver a positive price versus material cost spread. Volume and productivity are also strong, enabling us to drive solid margin expansion. As always, delivering strong free cash flow and directing capital deployment towards high-ROI projects remains core priorities. Lastly, we're excited about the pending Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Gardner Denver, creating a premier industrial company while simultaneously creating a leading pure-play climate technologies company focused on HVAC and transport refrigeration. We believe both businesses have potential to unlock value for shareholders.  Please go to Slide 5. This slide provides a visual depiction of organic bookings and revenue growth in the third quarter. As I discussed on the prior slide, we delivered strong broad-based bookings revenue growth in virtually all businesses and regions in our Climate segment in the third quarter, and the business was up approximately 10% in organic bookings excluding Transport and up 8% overall in organic revenues. Asia continues to see the impacts of trade tensions and broader economic uncertainty but remains a stable market. Commercial HVAC Asia organic bookings were up mid-single digits in the third quarter. Climate Asia organic revenues were down mid-single digits against the tough low-teens revenue comp in China in the third quarter of 2018. As I outlined in the prior slide, our Compression Technologies and Industrial Products businesses continued to be impacted by slowing industrial short-cycle spending. Our small electric vehicle business has continued to deliver strong growth, driven largely by our consumer vehicles strategy. All in, Industrial organic bookings and revenues were essentially flat in the quarter.  Please turn to Slide 6. We've encapsulated a number of takeaways from major end markets in this slide for your reference. I've covered much of this content already, so I'll just add a few brief comments before passing the call along to Sue. First, focused execution of our business strategy is enabling us to continue to deliver a very strong global HVAC performance, particularly in North America, Europe and in the residential business. Our end markets are largely healthy, and we believe we are outperforming the underlying growth rates in these markets. The Transport markets have softened a bit versus our view when we exited the second quarter, primarily driven by a softening of the European market, which continues to be impacted by weakening economic fundamentals and uncertainties surrounding Brexit. Overall, we believe focused execution of our strategy is enabling us to outperform global transport market conditions, and we are on track to deliver mid-single-digit growth in Transport for 2019.  Lastly, I've talked at length about slowing industrial short-cycle spending impacting our quicker book-and-ship small and midsized air compressors and Industrial Products businesses. We expect the softness to continue through the fourth quarter, consistent with our updated 2019 guidance. And we expect to offset the softness with the strength we're seeing in global HVAC.  And now I'd like to turn the call over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue? Susan Carter : Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #7. I'll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter with adjusted earnings per share of $1.99, an increase of 14% versus the year-ago period, driven by strong performance in our Climate segment. We continue to execute well in an evolving global landscape and remain on track to deliver against our full year organic revenue growth, EPS growth and margin guidance.  Third quarter organic revenue growth was strong, particularly in our Climate segment. Orders were also strong in our Climate segment. When excluding our Transport business that saw outsized order growth in 2018, organic bookings were up high single digits for the enterprise and approximately 10% for our Climate segment. In our Industrial segment, organic revenues were flat versus a tough year-over-year comp of 9% organic revenue growth in the prior year. Strong revenue growth in small electric vehicles largely offset the softness in the industrial short-cycle markets we mentioned previously.  During Q3, we expanded adjusted operating margins 70 basis points and delivered 25% operating leverage, consistent with our full year expectations. We continue to leverage our business operating system across the enterprise to manage direct material, tariff-related and other inflationary headwinds. As we look to the fourth quarter, we will continue to leverage our business operating system to drive further margin expansion. As Mike mentioned, we continue to expect strong free cash flow in 2019 of equal to or greater than 100% of net income. Through Q3, we have delivered approximately $1 billion in free cash flow and are on track to hit our full year expectations. Importantly, we continue to deliver on our balanced capital allocation strategy. During Q3, we deployed approximately $124 million in dividends and approximately $250 million on share buybacks. Looking forward, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Please go to Slide #8. Taking a step back from the details for a moment. Q3 was a very strong quarter with top-quartile performance. We delivered organic revenue growth of 6%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 70 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 14%. Organic revenue growth was driven by global HVAC strength in our Climate segment. Continued disciplined focus on pricing and productivity actions enabled us to effectively manage inflation and tariff-related headwinds and drive margin expansion across the enterprise.  Please go to Slide 9. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter of operating income growth, enabling us to drive solid year-over-year EPS growth in the quarter. Our Industrial segment delivered $0.05 of EPS growth with solid small electric vehicles growth and the addition of our Precision Flow Systems acquisition that we closed in Q2 more than offsetting revenue declines in other Industrial businesses. In addition to good segment performance, third quarter corporate costs were lower than prior year due to ongoing cost-management activities, lower stock-based and incentive compensation and the timing of unallocated corporate spending. We now expect our full year corporate cost to be less than $240 million, down from our previous guidance of approximately $250 million.  Please go to Slide #10. In Q3, strong execution drove 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement on strong price versus material inflation and productivity versus other inflation spreads. During the second half of 2019, we are lapping strong pricing implemented in the back half of 2018. Consistent with expectations, we delivered 40 basis points of margin expansion from price versus material inflation. This represents our sixth consecutive quarter of positive price/cost.  We delivered solid margin expansion from volume growth in the quarter. Margin expansion was tempered by mix pressure as we delivered outsized growth from commercial HVAC applied systems as compared to other initially higher-margin products like unitary or transport equipment. Over a 20- to 30-year life, an applied system carries high-margin service and aftermarket parts, but the initial sale creates pressure on margin mix. Additionally, consistent with last quarter, we saw mix pressure from softness in short-cycle industrial revenue, which also tend to have high margins. Productivity versus other inflation across the enterprise improved margins by 80 basis points in the quarter. In both our Climate and Industrial segments, we delivered strong productivity from operational excellence and restructuring savings. Reduced corporate costs also contributed to the margin expansion. We continue to invest heavily in growth and operating expense reduction projects with high returns on investment. Incremental Q3 investments totaled approximately 30 basis points. Please go to Slide 11. Our Climate segment delivered another strong quarter with 8% organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin expansion of 30 basis points. Consistent with our expectations, we delivered strong volume growth, price realization and productivity.  Please go to Slide 12. In our Industrial segment, organic revenues were flat against tough comps of 9% organic growth in the prior year. Strong revenue growth in small electric vehicles largely offset softness in the industrial short-cycle markets. Over the past several years, we have built a stronger, more resilient Industrial business. In our Compression Technologies business, for example, pricing, productivity and restructuring savings partially offset volume declines to enable deleverage within gross margin rates for the second quarter in a row. Industrial segment adjusted operating margins expanded 40 basis points in the quarter. Our high-EBITDA-margin PFS acquisition continues to improve our Industrial EBITDA margins. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margins 110 basis points in the quarter.  Please go to Slide 13. We remain committed to a dynamic capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high-ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects, which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership and margin expansion. We continue to make strategic investments in acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We have a long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time.  With the proposed transaction with Gardner Denver growing closer, I'd like to highlight that we expect to maintain our annualized dividend of $2.12 per share post-closing and through 2020. This will deliver a very attractive dividend yield for the new ClimateCo. For 2021 and beyond, we will evaluate dividend increases in line with earnings growth, consistent with our long-standing capital deployment priorities. We continue to see value in share repurchases, and we expect to consistently deploy 100% excess cash over time.  Please go to Slide #15. When we are on the road, we often get questions about the status of the proposed transaction to combine our Industrial segment with Gardner Denver. We continue to be excited about the prospects of creating a premier industrial company as well as a leading pure-play climate technologies company focused on HVAC and transport refrigeration. I'll give you a brief update today. First, the transaction with Gardner Denver remains on track for deal closure in early 2020. In reviewing our priorities between now and deal closure, our first priority is and will continue to be running the business and taking care of our customers. To maintain focus on our customers, we have dedicated teams carrying out separation and integration planning as well as ClimateCo transformation activities. Separation activities encompass separation of technical and financial operating processes and systems, manufacturing operations and supply chain services and real estate, along with all business regulatory filings. We have a detailed project plan, and we are executing against that plan. When necessary, we are creating transition services agreements to support day 1 operations for certain processes and services. At this stage, we anticipate onetime separation and transaction-related costs to be at the high end of our previously communicated range of approximately $150 million to $200 million. Given that, we and Gardner Denver continue to operate as 2 separate companies and compete in the marketplace until the close of the transaction. The integration planning work must be managed under clear rules and antitrust protocols. We will continue to work within these rules as we progress towards day 1 of the new Industrial business. Additionally, we expect to leverage this opportunity to further improve our Climate business to better serve our customers and unlock value for shareholders with a singular focus on reducing the world's energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions. We are building on an incredibly strong foundation with great businesses, engaged and talented people and a distinctive winning culture and core values. As I said at the beginning, we remain excited about the prospects of creating a premier industrial company as well as a leading pure-play climate technologies company.  On another note, given the outsized Transport order growth in 2018, we often get questions on the road about our order outlook. As we look at the fourth quarter, I'll remind you that we booked a large commercial order worth approximately $200 million in Q4 of last year. As we discussed when we booked this order, the revenues are expected to be recognized over the course of approximately 3.5 years. Excluding this large order, we have tough comps in the rest of the business where enterprise organic bookings were up approximately 11% and Climate segment organic bookings were up approximately 13%.  Please go to Slide #16. As we highlighted earlier, we continue to execute well in an evolving landscape. All in, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance remains unchanged at approximately $6.40. Our enterprise revenues and margin guidance also remain unchanged. With our continued strong Climate segment revenue growth led by global HVAC, we now anticipate full year organic revenues to grow between approximately 7% and 7.5%, a full point higher than our original guidance. Our Industrial segment revenues have been impacted by soft short-cycle investment spending. We now anticipate Industrial organic revenue to be flat to up 0.5% for the year as we expect short-cycle softness to persist in the fourth quarter.  Our guidance for both our Climate segment and our Industrial segment margin rates remain unchanged, although we do anticipate delivering towards the high end of the Climate range and towards the low end of the Industrial range. We are increasing full year restructuring cost guidance to approximately $0.30 from $0.25, primarily related to additional footprint optimization efforts. We have a couple of elements of guidance we also recommend tweaking, including reduced corporate spending to less than $240 million and a lower expected effective tax rate of approximately 20% to 21%. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Sue. Please go to Slide 17. In summary, we're effectively managing the global landscape as it evolves to deliver our 2019 guidance for top-tier revenue growth, EPS growth and free cash flow in 2019. Looking forward, we believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years.  Fundamentally, our strategy remains at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact. Today, 15% of the world's carbon emissions come from heating and cooling buildings, and by 2030, it's estimated that 25% will derive from these sources. Transport refrigeration creates another 80 million metric tons of CO2 emissions annually, which can be eliminated through electrification over time. Earlier this year, we announced our 2030 ESG commitments, which included a commitment to reduce our customer carbon footprint by 1 gigaton of CO2 through our HVAC and transport refrigeration products and services. We believe this is the largest customer climate commitment made by any B2B company, and our math shows that this reduction could equate to 2% of the world's total emissions. The size and scale is equivalent to the annual emissions of Italy, France and the U.K. combined. At the Climate Summit last month, we also introduced the same challenge to like-minded companies. We are bending the global warming curve by changing the way the world heats and cools buildings and moves refrigerated cargo. New technology we've developed can reduce up to 99% of the emissions that come from heating and cooling a commercial building. This doesn't include the substantial environmental benefit of increasing system energy efficiency through optimized system designs, advanced controls and data analytics, ongoing system monitoring and service and maintenance. These comprehensive solutions can also dramatically reduce power generation at the source and energy storage requirements. We're continually working to innovate in this way to electrify heating, electrify diesel engines used to cool trucks and trailers to transport perishable goods and to reduce the energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions in residential and commercial buildings. Our 2030 ESG commitments also include addressing a host of other important issues. We continue to transform our supply chain and operations to have a restorative effect on the environment, including achieving carbon-neutral operations and giving back more water than we use in water-stressed areas. We are committed to increasing opportunity for all, strengthening economic mobility and bolstering the quality of life of our people. Additionally, we're committed to gender parity in leadership roles, a workforce reflective of our community populations, maintaining livable market competitive wages and broadening community access to cooling, comfort and healthy foods. We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We have an experienced management team and a high-performing culture that instills operational excellence into everything we do. We remain committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital, and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to deliver top-tier shareholder returns over the years.  Lastly, we're extremely excited about the proposed transaction and the strategic combination of our Industrial segment with Gardner Denver. Combining 2 of the premier complementary industrial companies offers the opportunity to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful revenue and cost synergies supported by secular growth trends and diverse end-market exposure. We're also excited about creating the premier pure-play HVAC and transport refrigeration company with our existing Climate segment businesses. We have a tremendous opportunity to leverage a simplified business model and design and sharpen our sustainability focus and our investments. Our Climate businesses have clearly differentiated performance, and we see significant opportunity as a pure-play to build on this performance for our employees, customers and shareholders. And with that, Sue and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : I don't usually suck up on these calls, but congrats to you guys for not getting over your ski tips after a good first half and staying conservative. It obviously is warranted in this environment, so kudos to you guys for that. On the businesses, resi you're saying contributed to kind of orders and revenue growth, so that means it was kind of revenues up greater than high single digit and orders up around double digit. Is that kind of the messaging there on resi? Michael Lamach : Yes. Resi was strong, Steve. I agree with what you said. We typically don't think about residential bookings because residential bookings turn so quickly, but we did end the quarter with a low-teens booking number. So to the extent you can read a little forward into the fourth quarter, I feel it's going to be fairly strong again. Susan Carter : And I was going to say, Steve, as you think about that, our residential business, in addition to having good revenues in the third quarter, also had some tough comparisons to the third quarter of last year where the revenues were also very high. C. Stephen Tusa : Yes. Great. Clearly, you guys are taking some of the share that was lost by Lennox. What are the mechanics of kind of holding onto those customers? And is that -- do you feel like that's now yours to lose or as they kind of try and come back after that, there's a risk that, that fades? Michael Lamach : Yes. Steve, I would just say we're just executing our own strategy here. So this is building great stuff, having great distribution, working through all the technical and digital work that we've been working on now for a couple of years. So this is just really us executing against our own strategy more than it is anything else. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then just a quick one on the details on the productivity and other inflation. Even ex the corporate kind of benefits there, looks pretty solid, like up 50 basis points. I mean it was up 80 basis points reported. Anything specific to call out there? And is that kind of the benefits of recent restructuring? And is that something that you guys can pull a lever on in the future if things get a little bit weaker on your revenues? Michael Lamach : I'll let Sue comment here in a second, Steve. But one thing I'd say would be on the corporate side, we've worked really hard at reducing corporate costs and have thought about this over the past 1.5 years, 2 years now and putting the same lean tools towards benchmarking and executing against cost reductions there. So I'm happy to see that that's actually flowing through. And Sue, do you have any other comments? Susan Carter : Yes. I think when you think about the productivity in general, Steve, you're absolutely right. Some of the productivity in operations comes from normal productivity projects that we have on any given year, but it also comes from some of the restructuring that we've done over the past couple of years. And on the corporate side, to Mike's point, we've worked really hard at decreasing the functional spending over time. We know we've been successful at that in that we've leveled out the spending as well as have offset any inflation that comes into the corporate arena. And just in case anyone is thinking about the less than $240 million, the fourth quarter is when all different accruals and other things get trued up, so we didn't want to get ahead of ourselves on what that looked like. But all in all, a really good productivity quarter for the entire company. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Maybe to pick up on that thread a little bit. Should we view what we're seeing in corporate costs here as kind of a running start on the stranded costs? And could you update us on what your view there is and how that should play out maybe over the next couple quarters? Michael Lamach : Yes. Jeff, we've done a lot of work on the blueprinting to this point about where we think the opportunity is for all of ClimateCo, across all the Climate -- sorry, all the cost structure, whether that be at corporate or what's in the segments; also, rethinking what should be in corporate and what should be in the segments. But with that being said, there's probably 10 specific ideas we have kind of going forward into 2020 that we're beginning to execute on as it relates to the entire cost structure. And so yes, you can think about this as getting a running start on 2020. Jeffrey Sprague : And then just the order and revenue performance, certainly impressive. I'll echo that. How are you feeling about backlogs now, Mike? I mean did you have notable backlog depletion in this quarter? I think the commercial HVAC franchise overall was -- had something like 21% backlog growth last quarter, if I recall correctly. Just your visibility on Q4 I'm sure is very buttoned up, but how much further around the corner can you look? Michael Lamach : Yes. Pipelines look very strong coming in, backlogs look still very strong, Jeff. I have to go back and look at the 21%, you're talking about Q2 versus Q1. I'd have to go back and give you a number Q2 to Q3, but my guess is we didn't deplete much of the backlog there. That was a strong bookings quarter again for us. So that all feels good. Even in the industrial compressor business, we've had backlog build on engineered-to-order compressors, backlog build on oil-free rotary, backlog on services. So there is goodness built up, I think in the backlog going forward. The only place we saw a reduction in backlog would have been in Thermo King. And it's fundamentally just a weakening Europe from the last view we had in quarter 2 and then also just some summer cancellations that occurred. But backlog there is still above where it was this year last time, it's just a little bit less than it was last time we spoke at the end of last quarter. Jeffrey Sprague : And just finally on TK. Obviously, your comments are around Europe weakness, but kind of all eyes are probably on kind of the ACT numbers into next year. I think you're trying to avoid 2020 outlook here today on the call, but how do you feel about your ability to kind of counteract kind of pressure in that part of the business potentially next year? Michael Lamach : Yes. I think the context to put it in, Jeff, would to say that on a pro forma basis, ClimateCo would have about 5% or less than 5% of its revenues associated with North American trailer, which is really what we're talking about here. And if you took the ACT numbers at face value, it would reflect something on the order of an 18% decline between the 49.9 units this year and next year's units in the 41-and-change range. So if you think about that less than 5% revenue and 18 percentage drop, you end up with something less than 1 point of revenue headwind to the company. And I think that not only TK has significant levers to pull with a lot of new launches and product innovation coming through in 2020, but I feel good about the HVAC businesses at large and the backlog that we're building there in what I still think is kind of early to mid in the North American institutional cycle as well. So I feel like without giving specific 2020 guidance, we've sized that we think we've got plenty of levers to pull to have a good year in 2020. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : It seems like, and maybe I'm overreading this, but ESG has become a pretty big theme for you guys almost increasingly every quarter. And I guess what I'm wondering is how much does this narrow or widen the lens, I guess when it comes to M&A for once the deal is done? Meaning are you more likely to stick to HVAC or think more broadly? Does ESG as a theme overall kind of afford you at least the mindset to think a little bit more broadly? Michael Lamach : Well, I think you can think about it as a funnel really, you think about the enormity of the HVAC and transport refrigeration markets and businesses first. That's obviously what the go-forward company is very good at. And then you look at that in the context of any innovation or idea that we'd have that would make sense from reducing energy intensity or reducing greenhouse gas emissions point of view, it's going to be additive to that. So I think you look at those in combination as opposed to independently. Scott Davis : Okay. I guess that kind of answers it, but I'll move on to the next one. What do you think... Michael Lamach : Scott, just to be really clear because I want to be clear on this. We've got plenty to do in our core space. And so we're not opening the lens here to think about a third leg of the stool from a sustainability perspective. We're building the company on its HVAC and refrigeration roots. And to the extent we find things that lower energy intensity and lower greenhouse gas emissions within that, that's sort of a double check for us. Scott Davis : Okay. That's more clear. And just one of the things that's sometimes tough to analyze is the mix of nonres as you think about your order book. I mean is there a mix change as far as complexity and size of projects and things like that, that we should think about for 2020 or something in your backlog? Michael Lamach : Yes. The mix really wouldn't be size of projects. The mixes that come into play here are going to be things like applied systems versus unitary systems, which applied carry a lower initial gross margin but over the long haul, we're pretty agnostic to the margins because service margins really accrue to the applied business. And then as we're growing the HVAC business faster than the Transport business, of course, the Transport margins are higher than the HVAC business. So those are the general issues that we see. But as we look at the business regionally, the EBITDAs of the 3 businesses regionally are fairly close. And so we're somewhat agnostic to where in the world the growth is, but certainly, the actual product or systems or services can change the mix for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Just wanted to focus on the Climate revenue guidance a little bit. So you took up the guide, I think, for the year just over 1 point organically for Climate. Just wanted to confirm if that's mostly resi related. And you took up your resi market guide for the year. Just when you're thinking over the next 18 months or what have you, any perspective you could provide on the longevity of the resi replacement cycle in the U.S.? Understanding that resi is only 15%, 20% or so of the Climate piece. Michael Lamach : Yes. Julian, we took up Climate really based on just universal strength across the globe in pipeline bookings and backlog in general. So it would have been commercial and residential across the board. The point you made about residential going up, I think it might have been related to, last quarter, I think we had a bit of a typo in the deck. We might have said low single digit to mid-single digit. We didn't mean to do that. It was always mid-single digit. Zac, is that about right? Zac Nagle : No, it was -- we actually put low single digit in the deck instead of low to mid-single digit, which is what we've always intended. Michael Lamach : Yes. Okay. So we don't really feel different about res all year long, it's playing out the way that we thought it would. And then really to comment on the cycle, we've got, over the years, pretty good sources of data and analytics that are proprietary to what we use. And because our business is so dependent on replacement, it's well north of 80% replacement for us, we're watching it very carefully. But really don't see anything here in the near future that would change our view toward a strong 2020 in the residential business for us. Julian Mitchell : And then just my second quick follow-up would be around just if you could give some more color on the Climate business in Asia. It seems quite choppy, some of the construction trends there. You've got some tough comps, but you do have the benefits, I guess, of a lot of share gains from that distribution build-out you did a couple of years ago. So maybe just give us some context as to how you see growth there in your nonres Climate business in Asia and anything on competitive discipline as well. Michael Lamach : Yes. I think that we're still seeing Asia in general and China specifically, to your question, as being a good market over the long run. You're seeing a change within China around end markets themselves. And so if you think about the 3 largest markets in Asia, the retail, leisure and office, all 3 of those markets are down significantly. Retail is down -- I'm talking about the market, down about 15%; leisure down about 11%; office, about 6.5%. Those are big markets that are down. Interestingly, industrial markets are up. That's good for us. And things like education and transportation are up double digit. Even though they're smaller markets, but those are the markets that we wanted to focus on from an applied perspective as being longer cycle, but core to the economy, core to the 5-year plan in China. So we will continue to, I think, see good markets there and continue to see benefits of the direct strategy that we put in place in China. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So just want to go back to the productivity buckets and the 80 basis points. How did that land between the 2 segments? I know you've been restructuring in both segments, so I'm just curious whether it was heavier in one versus the other. And then maybe just touch on the Industrial business. What's changed since 2015 where we saw a lot of deleverage in that business? And I know that was partly due to the fact you just acquired Cameron. But what's changed today versus 3 or 4 years ago to kind of hold in margins a lot better through a choppier environment? Michael Lamach : Productivity was about equal between both segments. There's nothing remarkable that we're seeing really there. Inflation would have been higher on the Climate side, so the net would have been a little bit stronger toward Industrial net productivity. If you think about total productivity over nonmaterial productivity, Industrial would have been a little bit stronger. And there, there's been really good progress over the years. Just congratulate all our leaders in the industrial space. Todd's done a very nice job specifically in the Compression Technologies business around looking at some of this footprint there. And we've essentially gone from a number of larger compressor plants down to a smaller number and have executed that without missing a hitch, and so there's very strong market work there. I would tell you within the Club Car business, they're doing an outstanding job and have grown this consumer vehicle into a meaningful part of the business. And every time we sell a consumer vehicle versus a golf fleet vehicle, we mix up in terms of the margin. Pleased with what's happening in our tool and Material Handling business, and even Material Handling in particular has moved back to the black after pretty strong declines over the years in oil and gas. And then our Fluid Management and PFS business really had a record Q3 for them, and so we're proud of what's happening there. Coming out of private equity, it's always a challenge to improve margins, but the team managed to improve margins in Q3. So just across the board, good performance. And to us, it's a test of the resilience that we talk about in stress testing our business to make sure that when we do see negative revenue growth, that the deleverage can be maintained inside of our gross margins. And we get that question a lot from investors, and so it's important to point out that when we see this and we have leverage inside that sort of 30% margin number, it's indicative of the fact that I think we're executing well against the plans. Nigel Coe : Great. That's good detail. And then just on the -- you pointed out in the slides that big, $200 million project you booked in 4Q. What's the outlook for, number one, the funnel for commercial globally, maybe just touch on that; but specifically these large mega projects? Because I'm assuming that in a 0 net world, we'll see a lot more of these large projects, maybe rip-and-replace-type projects. So maybe just touch on that, please. Michael Lamach : Yes. It's almost normal now for us to see large projects in the pipeline. It's difficult to predict when they close and what they look like when they're complete. We've got a number in the backlog. I would say not as large as that, but maybe collectively, some of the larger projects would total that. So we are seeing more of that. It is more of a sort of base business for us at this point in time in terms of our ability to execute against that. And we're set up to do that. So we've invested heavily in that business, and we do have a pipeline of larger projects sitting in that backlog. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : Was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you saw in Service for both the Climate business and the Industrial business as well, a little more granularity around those growth rates. Michael Lamach : Yes. I mean Service for both has been a strategy for both, I mean so there's nothing new in terms of our focus on the services business there at all. Service has, for us, been something that's grown kind of in the high single-digit range, particularly in the Climate business, over the last decade or so. That continues to clip along at about that level consistently as we're going forward. And then as you've seen in the Industrial segment from the reports we did here, that we continue to see good service growth there, differentiated service growth there to the mix. So maybe a little bit less than what we've seen in Climate over time, but again, it's been a healthy mid- to higher single-digit growth in Industrial services over time. And really, when we're talking about industrial services, it's really in our compressor technology business. And that's generally going to be based off our larger centrifugal and engineered-to-order or our larger oil-free compressors as opposed to some of the book-and-turn smaller compressors, which don't have the same sort of service opportunity. John Walsh : Great. And then going back to kind of the M&A question. I mean I think a lot of time we focus on the larger deals, but you did get this smaller deal done here in September. And I was just kind of curious what kind of made this Arctic Chiller company an interesting property for Ingersoll. Was it something on the technology side? Was it something to do with where their service and sales reps were located? Any color around these smaller kind of singles that are out there to do in the industry would be helpful. Michael Lamach : Well, I appreciate you actually raising that. We've done about 18 or so of those in the last few years. A lot of them are sort of that size, maybe a little bit smaller. But typically, it's going to be a technology that we think is novel, it's innovative, it's not part of the portfolio today. It may come with a channel, it may not. But generally speaking, if we can take an innovative product and then move it through the dedicated Trane commercial channel, it's a home run for us. In other cases, there's also a strategy to maintain a second channel through independent routes, and that's an important element where we might go to market Trane for some of the portfolio and, in this case, Arctic Chiller for another part of the portfolio. So that multi-channel strategy can work for some of this as well. This is just a novel idea around a modular, smaller chiller design for modular small applications, and it just adds to our portfolio in that regard. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Andrew Obin : Just going back to Slide 10. If you look at volume leverage, any way you can decompose it between Climate and Industrial? And specifically, what I'm trying to get at, you cited applied impacting volume leverage at Climate, and I'm just trying to figure out how bad it was and when does it go away. Susan Carter : So Andrew, I think as you're looking in at volume in total, I think that volume that you're talking about, the volume leverage is going to come out of the Climate segment, which is what we were talking about with the markets a little flatter on the Industrial side. That isn't going to be the piece of it. And as we were going through the different areas in constructing this slide, what we wanted to look at was not only what it was contributing and then the comments around mix that we've given throughout the commentary, with that being more to the applied side than to the unitary side. But it was more on the Climate side than Industrial. Michael Lamach : Yes. And Andrew, on that, I mean I'm looking and I'm seeing volume kind of flowing through pretty much at the 25% level for Climate. It was the mix that kind of pulled that back a little bit from there. Then if I go to the deleverage, the organic side of the deleverage in Industrial, it delevered at about the gross margins of the business, hurt a little bit on mix. But again, this is where the productivity and managing that productivity equation and price helped that quite a bit. Andrew Obin : No, that makes sense. And just a follow-up question. I know institutional market is quite important to you. You seem to be constructive. If you look at construction put-in-place data, institutional markets, education, health care seems to be mixed at best. So what gives you confidence that this market continues to grow into the year-end and into 2020? Michael Lamach : Well, thank you, Andrew. What I always say is when you look at put-in-place you really only get about half of the visible market, and the other half of the visible market is the market that you go out and create demand with by putting offers to customers that would reduce their energy intensity or improve operations in their buildings. And so notwithstanding what you said, what I would tell you that in quarter 3, from a vertical market perspective, the strength we saw was in higher education and in health care. We saw that and continue to see that going into the fourth quarter and in 2020 just by virtue of the pipeline that we're chasing. Commercial and Industrial, we saw strength there in energy, food, beverage and interestingly, even in retail, which gets to be national accounts and some of the brick-and-mortar out there. So that was, again, really strong for us as well. But we're seeing a very good pipeline going forward in these markets, and that put-in-place data really tells only about half the story, not always indicative of what we're seeing in the marketplace. Andrew Obin : And do you guys track bond issuance in those markets? Do they tell you anything in terms of visibility? Michael Lamach : Yes. They -- well, they do. They give -- that's a very long leading indicator towards visibility in the marketplace. Generally speaking, when we know that a school district is going to vote or applying for bonds, we know generally then what they're trying to do or construct with those bonds. And so we're doing some preliminary work with schools as they're going out for bonds to get estimates for what things might cost and sort of what it might take from an operational basis to maintain those facilities. But of course, it's predicated on that bond actually passing. And then once that bond passes, it can go through a fairly traditional cycle of detailed models and designs all the way through procurement. So again, it's a very early indicator on a bond. But generally speaking, if we know a school district or hospital's going for a bond vote, we're going to be working with that customer to understand what the scope of the project might look like. Operator : Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Nicole DeBlase : So I just want to start on the Climate margins, just to take that a step further. So understanding that you guys did 25% incrementals on volume growth, the 4Q margin assumption seems to embed a bit of a stronger performance versus 3Q. Is that all accountable -- or attributable to the mix headwind going away? Or are you anticipating stronger incrementals on volumes as well? Michael Lamach : Nicole, just to be clear -- it's Nicole on the line, right? Nicole DeBlase : Yes. Michael Lamach : Yes? Okay. Good. I wasn't sure at first. So are you talking about quarter 4 Climate leverage specifically? Nicole DeBlase : Exactly, yes. Michael Lamach : Sue, what's your view on that? Susan Carter : Well, so as you look at the volume leverage in Q4, it is slightly stronger than it is in Q3. But again, the environment is roughly going to be the same as what we were seeing in Q3. So in other words, growth in all of the end markets, probably a same slight towards applied versus unitary, but there really isn't a huge amount of change that comes out of the volume leverage in Q4. But again, all of our businesses are going to continue to grow in Q4 residential, the commercial businesses, et cetera. Michael Lamach : Nicole, if you look at total leverage though for quarter 4, Sue is exactly right on the volume piece of it. What I would tell you is that the mix will hurt us a little bit more there. We think about more applied, less Transport. We would expect less price than we would have in Q3 sequentially just because we're kind of lapping price there again. So I would think that we'll manage the full year for the enterprise to the same 25% we've talked about. But I would expect that quarter 4 will look a lot like quarter 3 for Climate, probably not any better. Nicole DeBlase : Okay. Got it. That's really helpful. And then you brought up price/cost. Seems to me that because you're lapping tougher pricing comps in 4Q, price/cost impact to margins probably comes down a little bit. But thoughts on that? And then any early thoughts into 2020 just specifically on the price/cost front? Susan Carter : So if you think about Q4, I think the back half of 2019 is similar. So I think you'll see about the same thing in Q4 that you saw in Q3. And as I think about 2020 -- so I'm going to give you an answer, and it's not going to be what you want, which is what our guide is. But when I think about 2020 and I think about Tier 1 materials, steel, copper, aluminum should all be on the surface deflationary. So in a good spot, we see the spot prices coming down. We're seeing it in results, and that should be a really nice tailwind, if you will, going into 2020. The however is that as we look at this, we want to watch this play out over the upcoming months because we just do not know what the tariffs and all of those pieces are going to mean to 2020. So in other words, you could have deflation on those base materials and you could be offset by tariffs. You could have a change in the tariffs. And that's just something that we're not comfortable with trying to give that outlook on. So I can tell you what I see on spot prices and what we're doing on early buys of material going into 2020, but we'll just watch the environment and then as we get closer to 2020, give you a guide on what we think it looks like at that point in time. Michael Lamach : And Nicole, I'd say that there's been so much, as you know, volatility around news and announcements coming out around tariffs that, unfortunately, we've gotten pretty good at being able to react to it. It takes us about 2 days to get from an announcement or a change to having that flow through and understand from a gross perspective what the impact is. And it takes us maybe a week from that point in time to understand what we think we can do from a net perspective around mitigating some of that. And therefore then, we know at that point in time, probably a week or so later what we need to do from a pricing perspective. It's so volatile that I think we're comfortable with our ability to react and change, understand and push certain pricing through and mitigate what we can that, at this point in time, we're not trying to guess where things go in 2020 there. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Mike, just to follow up on, I think a couple questions trying to get at maybe kind of the shift in Climate over time toward more sustainability and energy efficiency. It seems like a lot of your competitors talk more about selling boxes, and you guys are talking more about selling solutions. Can you give us a sense for how that mix has evolved in terms of just kind of straightaway product sold through traditional channels versus something that is more kind of comprehensive sustainability path? Michael Lamach : Yes. I think 2 things have happened. I mean one is that obviously, the world is looking at regulations differently around greenhouse gas emissions, understanding the impact of refrigeration systems on the environment. That's one. Two, as these systems become greener, if you don't do anything to the fundamental underlying system, the refrigerants tend to be less energy efficient so you end up using more power to generate the same level of cooling or heating in the system. And so from a system level, it's really making sure that you can reduce the energy intensity while using next-generation refrigerants. And so there's a lot of innovation that goes into that. It also feeds right into how we think about the need to have a direct, very high-quality sales force out there, typically engineers or professional engineers selling to professional engineers and our customers in the commercial space. And that model exists for us all over the world because these are complex trade-offs. And then as you think about 30-year lives on many of these systems, any innovation you have, any advantage you have and what the cost of maintaining those systems will be can be a very meaningful sort of a kicker to total cost of ownership. And so it's just the way we go to market. It's our model. And when we think about creating demand -- it was the earlier question about put-in-place, and I said about half of it is put-in-place and half of it is going out and creating demand. The half that we go out and create demand with are looking for those kinds of customers that understand this technically and are wanting to do something about it and may have systems of an age or variety where there's a particular opportunity to go have a high return on invested capital. And so it's just a more sophisticated sale and way to market. And that's what we train people to do. I mean we train them technically and then we train them financially around how to go make the case. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. So it's really all the mix has shifted towards this. It's kind of getting away from, \"Hey, you need a box for the top of your strip mall and we'll sell you one?\" Michael Lamach : Well, it's really -- over time, it's you try to move away from responding to quotes to creating specifications, creating opportunities and creating your own demand. And that is the controllable element of what we do even in a downturn, right. As opposed to sitting back and waiting for something to be built and asking -- somebody asking you for a price, there's plenty to do in the world today to go out and create an opportunity for return on investment for somebody. The other thing too is in a downturn, and I've said this very often, we fully expect both our Service business and our performance contracting business to increase because you have to maintain or extend asset life. And if you can no longer extend the asset life, we've got a way of paying for these assets through the energy savings that we're willing to guarantee as part of the asset swap. Operator : There are no further questions queued up at this time. I turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Thank you, operator. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. I apologize to anyone who was not able to answer a question -- or get a question asked in the queue. However, Shane and I will be available all day today and obviously in the coming days and weeks to answer any questions that you may have, and we encourage you to call. And we look forward to seeing you on the road soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and then a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Ingersoll Rand's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast on our website at ingersollrand.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website.  Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; and Sue Carter, Senior Vice President and CFO. Also joining today's call is Chris Kuehn, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, who we recently announced will be succeeding Sue Carter as Chief Financial Officer after her planned retirement post closing of the Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Gardner Denver in early 2020. With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Before we begin today, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank Sue for her many contributions to Ingersoll Rand over the past 6 years as CFO. She's been a terrific business partner and a leader of the finance organization. And while we'll miss her once she retires in the upcoming months, we certainly wish her well in her well-deserved retirement. I'd also like to welcome Chris Kuehn to the call as the future CFO of Trane Technologies. Chris has been a strong business partner and leader at Ingersoll Rand since he joined the company 5 years ago. Execution of this succession plan is well underway in order to ensure a smooth transition and he's well positioned for the role. Sue will be with us through the close of the RMT transaction, and we're happy to have both Sue and Chris participate on the call today. Turning to Slide 3, I'd like to start out today's call with a brief overview of our global business strategy that's enabling us to consistently deliver strong financial results for our shareholders. As we continue to progress towards the close of the RMT transaction and prepare to transition to a pure-play climate company, our strategy remains unchanged. At its core, our strategy is at the nexus of environmental sustainability and impact, which are strong secular tailwinds for our business. The world is continuing to urbanize while becoming warmer and more resource-constrained as time passes. At our core, we are focused on and excel at reducing the energy intensity in buildings, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing waste of food and other perishable goods, and we excel in our ability to generate productivity for our customers, all enabled by technology. Unless you think the world is getting cooler, less populated and less resource-constrained as time passes, these strong secular tailwinds will continue to provide opportunity for shareholders and purpose for our vision. As I look back over the past several years, these secular tailwinds are only growing stronger and have a greater sense of urgency.  Moving to Slide 4. Fiscal 2019 was a great year for Ingersoll Rand with strong execution against all elements of our strategy. We delivered top-quartile performance with organic revenue growth of 6%, 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation of $1.8 billion or 118% of adjusted net earnings. We established a leadership role in tackling the world's environmental and sustainability challenges by putting forth our aggressive 2030 sustainability commitments, and we issued this challenge to like-minded companies in order to amplify progress towards a more sustainable future. We invested heavily in our core business, acquired Precision Flow Systems, entered into a game-changing RMT transaction with Gardner Denver, repurchased $750 million in shares and continue to pay a strong dividend to our shareholders, executing against all elements of our capital allocation strategy. The RMT transaction creates a leading industrial company. It also creates a world-class, pure-play climate control business which squarely focuses 100% of our portfolio on our sustainability strategy. Finally, we maintained very high employee engagement despite a rapidly changing environment with additional economic and geopolitical challenges, ensuring Ingersoll Rand remains a great place to work for our people. I'm very proud of our teams for delivering these strong results for our customers and our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, our global end markets largely continued to be healthy with solid revenue growth across North America, Europe and China. We've highlighted North America commercial HVAC's growth as a standout all year long, and the fourth quarter was no exception. Year-over-year revenue growth was up high teens in the fourth quarter alone despite very tough comps in 2018. We've talked about the extraordinary Transport business bookings growth in 2018 and the normalization process that's been occurring in 2019 with steep rates of decline in Transport bookings in every quarter. This has been a drag on top line enterprise bookings all year, so we've been providing bookings growth numbers, excluding our TK business, to help you understand the real underlying bookings of the enterprise to the climate business. I hope this information has been helpful to the investment community. In the fourth quarter, enterprise bookings were extremely strong, excluding TK, up high single digits. Climate bookings, excluding TK, were even stronger, up low teens. Net, our underlying business remains very healthy. Our fourth quarter enterprise and Climate leverage was lower than our guidance at the end of Q3. The lower leverage in the quarter was a result of 3 factors. First, revenue in our higher-margin Transport business declined high single digits in the quarter or roughly $50 million, deleveraging in line with gross margin rates. In addition, the combination of very strong commercial HVAC growth, coupled with Transport declines, drove incremental negative portfolio mix. The second impact is a good news/bad news story. On the positive side, we had exceptional free cash flow in the fourth quarter that well exceeded our forecast. So on the flip side, we needed to accrue a substantial increase to our full year incentive compensation plans as a result which impacted operating leverage. And lastly, we had some unplanned inventory adjustments in the fourth quarter. We know from your pre-call questions that the Transport markets are on many people's minds, so we devoted a fair amount of discussion to this topic throughout the presentation and at a slide near the end.  Throughout the year, we've talked about the significant declines in order rates expected in 2019 balanced against the very strong backlog we carried into the year. We expected that the net of the 2 factors, combined with increasing cancellations in summer and fall, will lead to a mid-single-digit revenue growth for 2019 and year-end backlog that returned to more normal levels. We highlighted that Europe was soft throughout 2019 and that we were largely in agreement with the ACT data, which was showing a correction in 2020 in North America trailer and that November and December 2019 and early 2020 market conditions and order rates are going to be important to really understand how the end of 2019 and 2020 might play out. We closed out 2019 with 3% revenue growth for Transport. Overall market demand in November and December did not pick up as much as we anticipated, and fourth quarter revenue was weaker than expected as a result. This knocked a couple of points off our full year Thermo King growth. We believe the fourth quarter marked the first quarter of what ACT and others believe will be a relatively short-lived downcycle as the booking anomalies for 2018 and 2019 reset, positioning the market for a flat or slightly positive growth profile for 2021. Our Industrial businesses continued to execute very well in the fourth quarter. Our leaders remain focused on running the business, and employee engagement remains strong, a testament to our culture and the strength of the businesses that will combine with Gardner Denver. In the fourth quarter, our Industrial business saw strong margin expansion on a low single-digit revenue decline. Good growth in Small Electric Vehicles was offset by soft short-cycle demand in Compression Technologies and Industrial Products.  We're seeing excellent payback on the restructuring, operational and commercial investments we've made in the business over the past few years as evidenced by our strong margin expansion in the quarter. We believe the business is well positioned moving into 2020 and for the combination with Gardner Denver. We continued our balanced capital allocation strategy throughout 2019 and in the fourth quarter. The strong free cash flow we're generating continues to provide us with good capital allocation optionality moving forward.  Please go to Slide 5. We exceeded or delivered towards the high end of the range against all of our guidance commitments for 2019 and delivered top-quartile performance. Again, I'm extremely proud of the entire Ingersoll Rand team for their hard work and perseverance, navigating through a very dynamic economic and geopolitical landscape in 2019.  Please turn to Slide 6. As we continue to move closer to the close of the RMT transaction with Gardner Denver, we're excited and well positioned to debut as Trane Technologies. 100% of our portfolio will be strategically focused on global megatrends and at the intersection of sustainability and advanced technology and innovation. All of our products and services are uniquely positioned to have a real and significant positive impact on reducing carbon emissions. We continue to compete in largely healthy end markets globally, and our strategy provides tailwinds to grow faster than GDP. While we expect the transport market to move through a short-term correction period, we believe this is a great business to be in over the long term. We expect the new Trane Technologies to continue to drive top-quartile performance, and we expect to deliver approximately 25% leverage in 2020 despite headwinds from our Transport business. We're excited about the new Trane Technologies business and expect to host an Investor Day in the fall to lay out our long-term strategy and targets.  Please turn to Slide 7. This slide provides a visual depiction of organic bookings and revenue growth in the fourth quarter. The underlying Climate business remains very strong with broad-based bookings and revenue growth in virtually all businesses and regions. Our Compression Technologies and Industrial Products businesses continue to be impacted by soft industrial short-cycle spending, while our Small Electric Vehicles business has continued to deliver excellent growth. The headline enterprise bookings decline of negative 6% does not accurately reflect the underlying strength of the business. Enterprise bookings were up high single digits, and Climate bookings were up low teens, respectively, when you exclude Transport and the very large quarter 4 2018 commercial HVAC order. Please turn to Slide 8. This slide combines our quarter 4 growth performance with our preliminary view of our major end markets for 2020. I've covered the main points regarding fourth quarter growth on the prior slides, so I'll focus my comments on our preliminary 2020 market outlook. Our global commercial HVAC outlook continues to be positive. Leading economic indicators remain largely supportive of continued market growth in 2020, albeit slower growth than in 2019. We're expecting to see low single-digit market growth for global HVAC with North American office, government, education and industrial markets all healthy. In the residential HVAC market, which is a North American market for us, we're expecting to see low single-digit market growth led by continued growth in the replacement markets, which is approximately 80% of our business today. Economic indicators are also largely supporting continued growth. As I discussed earlier, ACT, other data sources globally and our internal estimates point to transport markets moving through a relatively short-term downcycle in 2020 and a more stable market in 2021. I'll cover this in more detail later in the presentation. Relative to the industrial markets, we continue to see impacts of soft short-cycle CapEx spending in the fourth quarter, partially offset by solid growth in Small Electric Vehicles. We expect this to continue through the first quarter of 2020.  Through focused execution of our business strategy, we expect our businesses to grow faster than each of the major market growth expectations just outlined. And now I'll turn it over to Sue to provide more details on the quarter. Sue? Susan Carter;Senior VP & CFO: Thank you, Mike. Please go to Slide #9. I'll begin with a summary of a few main points to take away from today's call. As Mike discussed, fourth quarter organic revenues were particularly strong in our Climate segment. With consistent focus on sustainability and energy efficiency for our customers, our Climate segment delivered organic revenue growth of 7%, compounding a 9% growth in 2018. Climate orders were also strong, up low teens when excluding our Transport business that saw outsized order growth throughout 2018 and the approximately $200 million large commercial HVAC order that we specifically called out in the fourth quarter of 2018. In our Industrial segment, organic revenues were down 2% on a tough year-over-year comp of 6% in 2018. Small Electric Vehicles delivered continued revenue growth, which was offset by revenue declines in the soft industrial short-cycle markets we mentioned previously. Our team delivered exceptional free cash flow in 2019 of 118% of adjusted net earnings. We have delivered free cash flow in excess of adjusted net earnings consistently over time with a 5-year average of 107%. Adjusted earnings per share was up 6% versus the year-ago period, building on 29% growth in 2018. EPS growth was driven by operational performance in both our Climate and Industrial segments. Importantly, we remain focused on deploying excess capital on our best ROI investments for our shareholders. After reinvesting in our core business through a expense in capital in 2019, we deployed $510 million in dividends, $750 million in share repurchases and entered into or completed 4 acquisitions totaling more than $1.5 billion, including Precision Flow Systems and the pending RMT transaction with Gardner Denver. Moving into 2020 and beyond, we expect to continue to generate powerful free cash flow and execute on our balanced capital allocation strategy, deploying 100% of excess cash over time.  Please go to Slide 10. Stepping back from the details for a moment, Q4 was another strong quarter, capping off a year of top-quartile performance. In the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5%, adjusted operating margin improvement of 10 basis points and adjusted earnings per share growth of 6%.  Please go to Slide #11. As mentioned previously, our Industrial segment delivered strong margin expansion through productivity, operational improvements and restructuring savings. When coupled with the strong revenue growth in our Climate segment, we delivered another quarter of strong operating income and EPS growth in the quarter. Fourth quarter corporate costs were higher than prior year, primarily due to 2 impacts : first, the timing of functional spend was higher in Q4 2019 than in 2018; second, we achieved stronger-than-expected free cash flow performance in Q4, which increased our 2019 free cash flow conversion beyond our already strong forecast of 105% of net earnings to our actual results of 118%. Free cash flow conversion is one of our most important long-term financial metrics for a healthy company, and it plays a central role in our incentive compensation design. [ Net, ] the strong performance is great to see and is testament to the hard work by our employees globally. On the flip side, it costs us a little more in incentive compensation, and there was a full year true-up taken as a lump sum in the fourth quarter. Lastly, our effective tax rate in the quarter of 20% was in line with third quarter guidance but up versus the low 16.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018. Please go to Slide #12. Before discussing the elements of our margin bridge today, I'd like to highlight that we made one modification to what you've seen previously. We've separated volume from mix and combined mix with price, material inflation and tariffs. We believe this is a clearer way to visualize the margin bridge. As this is a bit different than you may be accustomed to, I'd like to take a couple of minutes walking you through the modification and why combining mix, price and material inflation and tariffs is a positive adjustment. Since late 2016, we've seen tremendous amounts of material inflation and tariffs that have been fast-moving and volatile. To offset the massive material inflation and tariffs, we have realized price increases in the neighborhood of 5x historical levels. At the same time, our business has been growing at very high rates, and we have a large percentage of business that is not driven off of a price list. The line between mix and price and inflation is thin already, and it has become more difficult to break mix and price apart at the level we've been providing on these bridges. For example, when we create a configured system for a high-rise in New York, that system is unique to that building. Since we have detailed tracking of input costs to calculate inflation, when gross margins on the project are better than the project down the street, the question we must answer is whether the margin improvement is because we've priced the project better or if it's better mix because we utilized higher-margin components in the system. To be clear, we are confident we delivered strong price/cost in the quarter, completing our seventh consecutive quarter of positive price/cost. We also delivered strong margin expansion from volume growth in the quarter. Negative product mix more than offset price/cost as we continued to deliver outsized growth from our commercial HVAC equipment as compared to revenue declines in higher-margin products like transport and short-cycle compressors and industrial products. Productivity versus other inflation was flat in the quarter. Our segments delivered solid productivity from operational excellence and restructuring savings. The savings were offset by the previously mentioned incentive compensation increases and Climate segment year-end inventory adjustments following an ERP implementation and footprint optimization projects. We continue to invest heavily in growth and operating expense reduction projects with high returns on investment.  Please go to Slide 13. Our Climate segment delivered another quarter of solid organic revenue growth. Consistent with our expectations, we delivered strong volume growth, price realization and productivity. As previously mentioned, operating leverage was below expectations, primarily due to the deleverage on Transport revenue declines and the year-end true-ups we mentioned on the previous slide.  Please go to Slide 14. In our Industrial segment, organic revenues were down 2% on a tough year-over-year comp of 6% in 2018. Strong revenue growth in Small Electric Vehicles was offset by revenue declines in the soft industrial short-cycle markets we mentioned previously. Over the past several years, we've built a stronger, more resilient Industrial business. Despite organic revenue declines in the quarter, our Industrial segment expanded adjusted operating margins by 240 basis points through productivity programs, operational improvements and restructuring savings. The combination of our operating margin improvement efforts with our PFS acquisition expanded EBITDA margins 350 basis points in the quarter.  Please go to Slide 15. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy that consistently deploys excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We maintain a healthy level of business investments in high ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership and margin expansion. We continue to make strategic investments and acquisitions that further improve long-term shareholder returns. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We have a long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. With the proposed transaction with Gardner Denver growing closer, I remind you that we expect to maintain our annualized dividend of $2.12 per share post closing and through 2020. This will deliver an attractive dividend yield for Trane Technologies. For 2021 and beyond, we will evaluate dividend increases in line with earnings growth and consistent with our long-standing capital deployment priorities. As we look forward to 2020, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy. We remain enthusiastic about the future opportunities to deploy excess capital to the best ROI investments, whether that be reinvestment in the business, a strong dividend, making value-accretive strategic acquisitions or repurchasing shares.  Please go to Slide 17. Anticipating the Reverse Morris Trust transaction will close early this year, I'll spend a few minutes walking you through a high-level 2020 outlook for Trane Technologies. After the proposed transaction closes, we anticipate the newly combined Industrial business to provide guidance, including our Industrial segment. Given the market backdrop Mike outlined earlier, we expect total reported and organic revenues to be up 3% to 5% in 2020 and broadly healthy HVAC end markets. During 2019, our Climate segment delivered 40 basis points of margin expansion. In 2020, on an apples-to-apples basis, we expect to further expand segment margins between 30 and 70 basis points. In the first quarter, we anticipate solid revenue growth in our HVAC business, offset by steep declines in our Transport business, creating continued mix headwinds. Mike will outline our Transport outlook in more detail later in the presentation. Apples-to-apples unallocated corporate expenses are expected to be approximately $260 million, including stranded costs previously allocated to our Industrial segment. I'll explain more about our stranded costs outlook later in the presentation. For modeling purposes, we also offer the following items. Depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $300 million. We estimate interest expense to be approximately $240 million, reflecting debt retirement of $600 million in the May time frame. We're targeting free cash flow to be greater than 100% of net earnings with capital expenditures approximating 1% to 2% of revenues, and we've modeled $500 million in share repurchases. And now I'd like to cover 2 topics of interest with you. Please go to Slide 19. We often get questions about the status of the proposed Industrial segment Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We've covered most of this slide throughout the presentation, so I'll cover a few points here. Entering 2020, we anticipate onetime separation and transaction costs to be at the high end of our previously communicated range of $150 million to $200 million. During 2019, we spent approximately $95 million, and we expect to spend the rest in the next few months. We continue to execute our detailed project plans to carry out all of the separation, integration planning and transformation work. Given that we and Gardner Denver continue to operate as 2 separate companies and compete in the marketplace until the close of the transaction, much of the integration and transformation work ramps after the deal closes. Last month, we announced that our pure-play sustainability-focused climate company will be named Trane Technologies, pending shareholder approval. We expect Trane Technologies to trade on the New York Stock Exchange as TT, and we plan to host our first Trane Technologies Investor Day in the fall of this year. In contemplating the timing of our Investor Day, we recognize that 2020 is the third year of the 3-year financial targets we set at our Investor Day in mid-2017. Today, we're giving guidance for the final year which will complete that 3-year plan. Additionally, between now and the time of the Investor Day, we will close the transaction, begin operating as 2 separate companies, file the appropriate historical financial statements and give you a chance to analyze a couple of quarters of reporting under our new segment structure. With those tasks complete and 2020 performance well underway, we will be in a position to give long-term financial targets and further outline Trane Technologies' continued strategy at Investor Day.  Please go to Slide 20. We also get questions about the stranded costs associated with the RMT transaction and how to model the savings for our new Trane Technologies. With that in mind, I'll walk you through the math illustrated in the chart at the bottom of the slide. Starting from the left, our 2020 unallocated corporate cost guide was $250 million at the time of the agreement. At the time, we also estimated approximately $50 million of allocated corporate costs were being absorbed by our Industrial segment that were not specific to Industrial. In addition, we are targeting $50 million of cost reduction for a total of $100 million of stranded costs. To make the math simple, we've shown a re-baseline totaling $300 million that includes both the unallocated costs and the costs currently allocated to the Industrial segment. Our guidance for 2020 unallocated corporate costs of $260 million reflects a $40 million reduction in stranded costs netted against the $300 million re-baselined corporate costs. To be clear, these cost reductions may come from corporate or from the Climate businesses. We are presenting guidance in this way to give you easily comparable Climate margin and corporate cost targets for modeling our 2020 outlook. As we move to 2021, we plan to remove an additional $60 million from either corporate or the Climate businesses to achieve our full $100 million stranded cost reduction target. To realize these stranded cost reductions, we expect to spend approximately $100 million to $150 million. We'll provide quarterly updates on our stranded cost reduction progress. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Sue. Please go to Slide 21. The last topic of interest is related to transport refrigeration. While this is a preliminary view based on available forecasts and our internal estimates, I'll cover both what we are currently anticipating for the major end markets for the Transport business and what we expect to see for our Thermo King business specifically. Given the complexity of this topic, we've significantly expanded the level of disclosure on our TK business for the purpose of this discussion. We hope this will be useful in better understanding our outlook for the market and for our TK business. We expect the transport markets to move through a short-term correction period in 2020. We're expecting to see steep declines in North American trailer and APU and mid-single-digit declines in truck. These businesses account for approximately 40% of our TK business. We currently expect the decline to be most significant in the first quarter where the market faces tougher comparisons to solid growth in the first quarter of 2019 but to remain challenging throughout 2020. We're also expecting to see a high single-digit decline in our European, Middle East and Africa trailer business with a steep decline in the first half of the year and recovery in the second half. The truck business in EMEA is expected to be lumpy but flat for the overall year. What's shown as the all other market for TK reflects aftermarket parts, marine, bus, rail, air and a few of the relatively smaller regional markets where market forecasts are not as robust as in North America or Europe. However, for these markets, we're currently expecting modest growth of low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth in 2020. We believe we have the opportunity to outperform the overall markets in 2020, in part by leveraging the 40% of our business that is in markets where modest growth is expected. We believe we have opportunities to significantly outperform in areas such as aftermarket parts, where consumption increases in a downcycle; and in APU, where we continue our successful strategy to improve our bolt-on rate beyond current levels. We also anticipate outperforming the overall trailer and truck markets in both North America and EMEA through innovation and new product launches and where we see opportunities for share growth. The situation is obviously fluid in transport refrigeration, and we're closely tracking order rates and other market indicators to improve our line of sight into 2020 moving forward. At the present time, however, we're guiding for quarter 1 TK revenues to be down somewhere in the 20% range and for 2020 TK revenues to be down in the 5% to 10% range. Please go to Slide 22. 2019 was another year of top-quartile financial performance with strong revenue growth, EPS growth and free cash flow. Looking forward, we believe the company is extremely well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the next several years. Fundamentally, we excel where global megatrends and sustainability intersect with our innovation and capabilities. Today, 15% of the world's carbon emissions come from heating and cooling buildings, and another 8% comes from global food loss, and these numbers are growing. We are continually innovating to bend the curve on global warming. By 2030, we will reduce our customers' carbon emissions by 1 gigaton by changing the way the world heats and cools buildings and moves refrigerated food, medicines and other perishables. We've been heavily investing for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. We have an experienced management team and a high-performing culture that instills operational excellence into everything we do. We remain committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital, and we have a strong track record of deploying excess cash to deliver top-tier shareholder returns over the years. And lastly, we're extremely excited about the pending RMT transaction and the strategic combination of our Industrial segment with Gardner Denver. Combining 2 of the premier complementary industrial businesses offers the opportunity to drive significant innovation and growth with meaningful revenue and cost synergies, supported by secular growth trends and diverse end market exposures. And personally, I couldn't be more excited about creating the premier pure-play HVAC and transport refrigeration company as Trane Technologies. Our Climate businesses have clearly differentiated performance, and we see significant opportunity as a pure play to build on this performance for our people, customers and shareholders. And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Just a question on the kind of timing of everything that's happening here. I think you might have touched on an update. But when would you expect to kind of have a little bit of a deeper dive on the new TT business from an Investor Day perspective? Susan Carter;Senior VP & CFO: So Steve, it's Sue, and Chris can join in with that. The first thing we're going to do is finish off the very detailed work that's going on right now on the separation of the Industrial businesses and then start building off of the base that we've got. We'll have to go through and issue some historical financial statements and then transition into that. But Chris, your thoughts? Christopher Kuehn : Sure. Hi, Steve. Good to meet you here virtually over the phone. To Sue's point, I think there is a fair amount of effort still left to get done. We're on track from the RMT closure to be completed here in early 2020. But right after we do complete separation, we've got some requirements to restate some prior year financial statements. And I would expect around that time, we'd provide some more information around the historical view of Trane Technologies at that point.  I think from an Investor Day perspective, we are targeting kind of that September time frame with respect to getting us a chance of having a couple of quarters of closes under the new Trane Technologies structure and then be ready to walk out with a little bit more details here in the fall. Michael Lamach : Steve, Mike here. 1 second, Steve. I would say that, just from an internal planning perspective, once we've filed all that we need to file around the restated financials, targeting something like a 5- to 10-day period after that, after you've digested it to come back and provide more guidance. And so we'll likely structure a call, put a presentation together and lay out the 2020 guidance. And then we'll reserve until the Investor Day, report back on the last 3 years and then restate kind of going forward likely another 3-year view for Trane Technologies through 2023. C. Stephen Tusa : Okay. And then thanks for the color on all the TK moving parts. When would you expect kind of the orders comp to get easier? Is that kind of a -- just remind us when you would think these orders should bottom out. Michael Lamach : Yes. Steve, the way our revenue bottoms out, first, I would say that you probably are just going to see the bottom in both Europe and North America in the first quarter, and then it's going to still be negative, obviously, as you can see from the graphs we've got on Slide 21 in the deck, for the balance of the year. But from a bookings perspective, you recover obviously a little bit quicker than that. Although there is a fair amount of [ book in turn, ] I think that will happen in the business. And so the comps get easy third, particularly fourth quarter. So second, third, fourth quarter, you get to see bookings, I think, improving. Revenue progressively improves throughout the year in both regions. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Thanks, Sue, for all the help. Maybe just a question around the Climate revenue growth. Just wondered within that low single-digit commercial HVAC market assumption for 2020, what are you assuming for Asia, given orders were down through most of 2019? And how much of a jump in the U.S. do you think you'll have this year after such a good 2019? Michael Lamach : Yes. Julian, I want to be careful not to mix market expectations versus our internal businesses. So the market, I think that North America remains very healthy. We'll see growth across the board, equipment parts, services. I think that we feel good about what will happen in institutional, particularly education and health care. We expect industrial and commercial also to remain healthy. And then if I translate to our internal view in North America, as an example, we end the year at the 17% high teens kind of backlog over the prior year. So the setup for us and the setup for the market look pretty good.  In Europe, where you've got the sort of flattish expectation in 2020 and still some lingering Brexit execution uncertainties, we'll continue to outgrow the market as we have been, really based on the whole sort of sustainability focus and the go-to-market strategies that we've had there. So we expect to grow -- sort of outgrow the market at least a multiple of 2x or 3x there, I would assume, off a very slow kind of growth in the underlying market in Europe. Middle East, Africa HVAC, it's going to be positive, but the patterns there are always lumpy because, particularly in the Middle East, these orders tend to be large district cooling plants. And so they're very large orders when they come, and so you get a little bit of an anomaly there. And then actually, healthy growth in China and for the AP region, in general. And again, here, the backlog that we've got in China, fourth quarter versus prior year fourth quarter, is up low double digits. So a good setup for us kind of coming into 2020, so I feel pretty good about what's happening in the commercial HVAC space. And residential, similar view, 80% of the market for us is replacement. Underlying markets still look good. Consumer confidence still remains relatively high. U.S. economy remains relatively healthy. Unemployment is low. GDP is stable, so pricing remains healthy. I think the market there appears to be pretty solid going into 2020. Julian Mitchell : And then just my second question around Climate margins. Just looking at your margin guide for the segment for 2020, backing out what you're seeing for Thermo King or Transport, it implies the non-Transport piece margins are up maybe 80 basis points or so in 2020. Just wanted to check that was roughly in line with what you were thinking and to what degree you think that number is back-end loaded, again, excluding Transport. Michael Lamach : Yes. I mean at starting point, I'll let Sue and Chris chime in. But you really end up with a pretty low quarter 4 comp that we just completed when you think about most of those impacts really were center hit on the commercial HVAC markets. And so the road map we've got here is still a strong pricing environment, probably a moderating materials environment. Our productivity pipeline looks robust, should cover all of inflation. Volume should drop through our gross margins. We don't see anything happening there, and we don't see any repeat issues that would have been in the fourth quarter. I mean, obviously, we talked about the silver lining perhaps in the cash conversion. But some of the inventory adjustments were partially a result of just an immense amount of factory consolidations that were done starting in '18 and through '19, and those don't repeat. That smooths it out as well. So I feel like we're in great shape on commercial. I think residential continues to hum along, a good conversion there. I don't see any changes there. And even in a market like Latin America, we had great success in '19. It appears to be recovering, particularly Brazil, I would highlight. Margins there are good for us, and I think that can help contribute as well. Operator : Our next question comes from John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : And I'll echo the sentiment, a thank you to Sue for all the help. Susan Carter;Senior VP & CFO: Thank you, John. John Walsh : Sure. Wanted to maybe get a mark-to-market on where we stand with kind of the controls and the connected buildings platform. I know last time, I think we got an update on that revenue base. It was north of $1 billion, and you guys used to throw out some metrics around the number of connected buildings or the portfolios of buildings that you were monitoring. Can you kind of mark-to-market us on that? Michael Lamach : Yes. John, I would start with a caveat that if a company can actually tell you the revenue generation from their digital business, they probably don't have a digital strategy because the whole strategy really hits every bit of the value stream, from the way that you design and develop systems to not fail all the way through to the way you monetize offerings in the service business through to the way that you utilize fixed service contracts, fixed service agreements to deliver service in more creative and better ways for the customer. So you put that all together, and it's in everything that we're doing. So it continues to be the norm. I would say 100% of what we're shipping out in the applied space today is absolutely communicating. If not inside the customer's firewall, it's coming across to us with important data. We're acting on it. At last count, I think we've monetized in our commercial space alone about 20 different offerings that we put together in that space that use digital to monetize. Same thing would hold true to TK. Interesting with TK, I'm just going to kind of maybe skip to this as a little bit of a story here. When you look at ACT's 2020 forecast of 37,500 units, we look at the replacement of units on the road today in North America, and we get to a number of about 35,000 units. I mean you can think about more than 90% of the market ACT is representing could be accounted just through replacing units. Well, part of the reason that we know where these units are and whether or not they're a candidate for replacement would be through things like the telematics that would tell us how systems are operating. And so that's a great example of how the game really changes when you've got a complete digital strategy across these businesses. John Walsh : Got you. And then just looking at the investment in other line, obviously you covered a little bit in the prepared remarks, but that -- it's been a long time since we've seen that flat. You have the comment saying gross investment spending remains at high levels. As we think about 2020 and beyond, does that flip back to be a headwind? Or are you kind of plateauing right now on how you're thinking about your investment spending? Michael Lamach : Well, we're coming through some really major platform investments and have been a multiyear investment for Thermo King, let's just say, in particular. That's going to tend to kind of flatten out there but likely not in the Trane business, particularly with some of the regulatory changes that will happen between now and 2023. So it's at a very high rate. A good estimate for 2020 is it's probably as low as 20 bps of incremental and maybe as high as 50 bps of incremental that will go into the Trane Technologies portfolio for 2020. Susan Carter;Senior VP & CFO: John, I would also add that as you think about those investments, that's such a huge part of the capital allocation strategy and what we do with the business that we are a great generator of cash. We have processes throughout the company with investment review boards looking at various and sundry things. We want our businesses to bring us great ROI projects that continue our growth and continue the great capital allocation strategy that we've got. So as you think about Trane Technologies going forward, I see that great cash generation as an opportunity and a way to really do great capital allocation with investing in the businesses. And I think that should continue, and I think you'd want that to continue. Christopher Kuehn : I'll just affirm here, Sue, this is Chris, that it will continue that way, knowing that we have a strong free cash flow generator in Trane Technologies, and we'll be following those similar priorities for capital deployment. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Good luck, Sue. Susan Carter;Senior VP & CFO: Thank you. Jeffrey Sprague : Appreciate all the help. Two questions on TK. First, just aftermarket, in general. Has it been your experience historically that when you get into OE equipment downdrafts, that aftermarket actually does grow? Certainly, we've seen in some machinery and equipment markets that aftermarket doesn't turn out to be quite as countercyclical as people would have hoped. So I would imagine it would typically decline less. But the question is, does it actually tend to grow in those downcycles? Michael Lamach : Yes, Jeff. There's a number of things that I think that we can count on and, in some ways, drive and control even with the trailer decline forecast for 2020, and that's one of them. So if the standard aftermarket growth rates would be something kind of in the normalized 3% to 5% range, as an example, if all 35,000 North American units that are probably up for replacement wouldn't be replaced, which would be an extreme view, you'd likely see something in the high single digits. Our experience has been something maybe 8% to 10% if that were to be the case. So that tends to always pan its way out. The other thing that is interesting when you look at the auxiliary power unit bolt-on rate, think in 2016, we were talking about something in the 10% to 11% kind of bolt-on rate there. And we said, look, we think we can move this thing. And for every 2.4 units of APUs we sell, it equates to 1 trailer unit. That was a strategy to help us through 2016 and '17. We actually have increased that bolt-on rate by 10 points, so we ended the year kind of in the low 20s. The remarkable thing about that is that's with the denominator, right, increasing dramatically in terms of what was built in terms of OEM tractors put out into the marketplace. Other interesting thing there is the replacement factor that we see out there for APUs going into 2020 is roughly 102,000 units that are available. That's compared to a 99,000-unit market. So here, you've got a replacement rate opportunity that's actually bigger than a new complete. So by taking the same experience we've had around bolt-on rates moving 3, 4 points a year with even a more aged APU fleet out there, that's an opportunity for us.  The NPD launches I've talked to, the new platforms, should be good. And we've worked 3 years to get these things ready for the market. And as I said in my remarks, truck, bus, rail, those will all grow, too, small truck, in particular, bus, rail, all grow, too. So those are sort of factors that we can count on, I think, in 2020. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. And then just to follow up on Slide 21. I appreciate you trying to help us here and that you're kind of noting the scale isn't exact. But the position of the plus 20% and the minus 40% looks pretty proportional to where the 0 is, right? And so everything on that chart, with the exception of APUs, looks like it's down less than 20% with all other actually positive. So just a little unclear how or why you'd be guiding Q1 down 20% in aggregate. Michael Lamach : I can't speak to the scale. Maybe Zac or Shane, who drew the scale could talk to that. But... Zac Nagle : Yes. I mean, Jeff, the market will be down close to 30% for trailers in the first quarter, North America trailers; Europe trailers, a similar number. APUs will be down in the 35% to 40% range. So that's really how you get there, the balance of the market being the other 40%. So it's really the decline in the areas that really outgrew in the last -- in the fourth quarter of 2018, which were trailer and APUs, and those are down the most. That's the reason. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : Sue, thanks for all your help. Susan Carter;Senior VP & CFO: Thanks, Andy. Andrew Kaplowitz : Mike, you've been talking about your focus on sustainability and improving efficiency for a long time now. But given the continued strong bookings, especially in North America and commercial HVAC, are you just seeing more awareness and acceptance of your HVAC systems capability, especially in markets like office and education, to help meet your customer sustainability goals as they look to replace their equipment? And is that allowing the business to increasingly look better than the macro data that we see like construction starts? Michael Lamach : Yes. I mean first of all, it's a passion inside the company. What I'm telling you around company purpose is something that gets deeply ingrained and even how investments and projects get evaluated because that's how we think we're going to win in the marketplace, and so it's very tied out in terms of how we deploy goals and how we look at projects going forward. So that, for sure, I think, is critically -- a critical factor in all of this. When you look at some of the Dodge data, as an example, and the put-in-place which people look to, it's interesting, and I'm just going to talk obviously about North America here, which is where the Dodge data is more relevant. You take our commercial business and you split it right down the middle, 50-50, between equipment and services. And of the 50% that's equipment, you get 60% to 70% of that which is replacement, which generally is not ever going to be reported on Dodge put-in-place because we're negotiating energy service agreements, service contracts, retrofits. So that really only has the Dodge put-in-place data addressing about 15% to 20% of the business. And so as folks try to read through that to our commercial business on Dodge data or ABI data, you're probably only predicting 15% to 20% of what that looks like. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then just following up on some of the comments you made on China commercial HVAC. If I look at the bookings, they look like they turned down a little in Q4, but you mentioned backlog is up low double digits. So was it just kind of timing? And can you give more color on China? I assume you continue to grow service penetration. What particular end markets are helping you in China? Michael Lamach : Well, first of all, when we talk about Asia, in particular, we have to remember that China is sort of half of the business, and the rest is the rest of the region. China was actually relatively strong. The bookings were -- looked okay. Backlog, as I mentioned, is up double-digit year-over-year. And so a lot of the weakness was outside of China. And I think, in some ways, you see those markets recovering. You can think about electronics in South Korea. You can think about those sorts of markets were -- which were pretty tough. But we expect healthy growth in China and for the region in 2020, strength in health care and we think a rebound in some of the technology segments, which where we've been a big player historically. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Congratulations to both Sue and Chris. Sue, you'll be missed, for sure. Susan Carter;Senior VP & CFO: Thank you, Joe. Christopher Kuehn : Thank you. Joseph Ritchie : So maybe just my first question, just following up on that China question, Mike. Clearly, you guys have done a great job growing into Tier 3, Tier 4 cities and the attachment rates. Obviously, a lot of concern right now given the virus outbreak. I'm just curious as you look forward and you think about like previous times, whether it's SARS impacting your business, have you seen any impact at all at this juncture from the virus? And how has this kind of played out for you guys historically? Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, first of all, we've had no impact yet to employees, which is important. And I think we've sent 650,000 masks is what I saw to China, so we're trying to do our part there on that. I will tell you that what we believe we know today is that best case would be China essentially going back to work on February 10. This is sort of the market in general and sort of our business as well. So if that's the case, I mean, you're talking about really a week of production, and that's just going to get pushed. I mean that demand is there. It will get pushed out. Maybe it will get absorbed in the quarter, if it's possible to do. If not, it will get pushed to the second quarter. So it's fluid. We're watching it closely. We're looking at the supply chain as well. We generally have strong supply chains. We generally tend to work in region for region. But to the extent we've got any Chinese components being imported, say, into the U.S. or Europe, we'll generally keep, in those cases, 8 to 10 weeks of inventory on hand. So again, a 1-week or 2-week issue is not going to be a problem for us with regard to that. But Joe, it's fluid, and I'm hoping that this thing is contained. And best case looks to be people are back to work February 10. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. Okay. That's helpful color, Mike. And then maybe just my follow-up here. Slide 21, super helpful, so nice job, Zac and Shane. Just curious as you kind of think about the climate business ex Transport, is there anything we need to be aware of from either growth or margin standpoint as you think about cadence for 2020? Michael Lamach : None that I can think of. Guys, anybody have any color on that? Susan Carter;Senior VP & CFO: No. What I was thinking about, Joe, was as you think about the markets, when you think about HVAC with commercial and residential, it's going to follow the same cadence that it has historically followed with Q2 and Q3 being our stronger quarters. So I think that stays in line with what we're doing. We do think that Q1 is going to be a quarter where the volume is tough and -- in buildings. So I think that one is an area where you can think about Q1 maybe not quite being at historical levels of contribution. The other thing that I would say, and I sound like I just think about cash. But I think as you think about Climate and Trane Technologies, we talked about this at the time of the [ stand-up, ] we believe that we're still going to generate 100% or greater than net income over time in the Climate business. It does tend to be a little more back-half loaded than what we've seen, although I'm sort of laughing because we did have such a huge fourth quarter for cash flow this year. But I think that's one of the impacts that you might see. So revenues sort of following normal patterns, other than the TK guide that we've already talked about, and cash flow more back-end loaded. Michael Lamach : Yes. What I'll say, Joe, is that I go back to commercial North America, which has been just incredibly strong, and it's strong across the board, meaning that the -- even the unitary and services growth have been double -- unitary spend in the teens, but the applied growth has been extraordinary. The win rates there, the pull-through of systems has been excellent. Now that does initially book and ship at generally lower margins than the unitary business. But of course, you get the long service tail in the applied business. So in the long run, it's a great business to win. But it does put a little bit of probably mix pressure within Trane, commercial, and that, again, is one of those mix pressures we saw in quarter 4 as well. And so historically, I usually get the question, and I didn't get it so far, but I'll talk about it. We end up historically something in the 15% range of Q1 EPS to the total year. And the last 3 years has been that. 6 years have been a little bit lower than that. I would tell you sort of a safer guide here would be something between 14% and 15%, just a result of that strong mix differential between applied and unitary and between TK and Trane. Joseph Ritchie : Yes. Tusa must have been caught offguard. Zac Nagle : Yes. Joe, just to add to that, we're actually -- since we're guiding OI at this point, I'd say the average for OI for Climate as a percentage of the year has been in the 15% range. It will probably be in the 14% to 15% range this year, so a little lighter in the first quarter. Michael Lamach : Thanks, Zac. I'm so used to EPS after all this time that we're going to [ talk ] about OI. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Sue, it was such a pleasure working with you, I think, actually with multiple companies, so congrats, and good luck. Susan Carter;Senior VP & CFO: Thank you, Andrew. Andrew Obin : Just a question. Residential construction, can you just walk us through your framework? How much visibility do you think on resi construction cycle over the next several years? And what gives you confidence that it will continue sort of to be positive? Michael Lamach : Yes, Andy. It's such a small part of kind of what drives our business that, to us, we would far be -- far from be the experts on giving you a forecast there. I mean if you think about the res equipment business being probably 10% of the company going forward and you think about 80% of our business there being replacement, new construction doesn't move the needle one way or the other for us, really, in our residential markets. So I'd probably defer to some of the better forecasts that are out there on that one than tell you that we've got a good read on that. Andrew Obin : Yes. I was just asking more as a lead indicator for nonres. Another question I have for you. How should we think about Trane's market share over the next couple of years? You've done a fantastic job. So how sustainable it is and what are the headwinds? Michael Lamach : Well, I mean, when we guide, we're generally guiding on what we think the market is going to be, pricing, some sense of volume, some sense of mix. We always target our teams with market share and margin expansion, so the goals there are always higher than what you see, and I think that's a healthy thing for us to do. I feel really good about what's coming out into the marketplace, feel good about a lot of the training and development we've had around the company in terms of systems, sales and some of the more sophisticated offerings that we do around services. So I feel like there's a lot of ways to win. It's not always on the product technology, although we're a leader there, and that's a heavy part of the investment. But it's also in the way that you go to market in a way that the expertise gets played out in the channel. And as you think about what I've always said in the commercial space, these are always going to be people that are 100% dedicated on behalf of the company. This is not something that you see sort of distributors doing for us. That's such an important thing when you're trying to drive an overall system strategy and trying to sell total cost of ownership over the long run. It's a sophisticated sale generally done by very technical people. They've been doing it for a long time, and that's something that's very difficult to replicate and something we always invest in that capability. That's a big part of the secret sauce, I guess, of the business. Operator : And that's all the time we have for questions today. I'll turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing comments. Zac Nagle : I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call and to remind everyone that we'll be available for questions, as always, today and in the coming days. And then we look forward to connecting with you soon on the road, in upcoming conferences and roadshows. Thank you very much. Operator : That concludes today's conference call.

And I'll be your operator for the call. The call will begin in a few moments with the speakers' remarks and then a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Zac Nagel, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Zac Nagel : Thanks operator. Good morning. And thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies First Quarter 2020 Earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechologies.com, where you will find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures which are explained in financial tables attached to our new release. Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Chris Kuehn, Senior Vice President and CFO; and David Regnery, President and COO. With that please go to Slide 3 and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Mike Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. Under normal circumstances, I'd start today's call with a brief overview of our global business strategy and how that's enabled us to deliver strong financial results to our shareholders. But today, we're living through anything but normal times. So suffice it for today's call, although we've got a new look and feel under our new Trane Technologies branding, our long-term strategy is unchanged. With that in mind, I'm going to move directly to Slide 4 and into the heart of our presentation today. The focus of our call today is less about earnings in the quarter or even in 2020 and more about the long term health, strength and positioning of Trane Technologies as a pure-play climate control company, business conditions adapt and eventually improve in a post COVID-19 world. The depth and duration of the downturn and subsequent recovery is a multivaried equation that's impossible to solve. None of us have ever experienced anything like this in our lifetimes. And we can't effectively draw conclusions from historical reference points because there aren't any. Social distancing has never in part of our recession vernacular and it provides layers of complexity to our daily life that has far reaching personal and professional impacts that we are learning about and trying to adapt as we go. And for some, these impacts are more devastating and more personal than others. As a global leader in our field, working with thousands of customers and suppliers and touching the lives of exponentially more people. How we lead through this crisis and thing we prioritize matter deeply. The implications of leading companies' actions are far reaching. Major employer acting with a singular short-term profit focus can take down the community. Community can take down one or dozen of companies and the unintended consequences can keep rolling downhill exacerbating an already very challenging situation. We strongly believe the right course of actions for our employees, our customers and shareholders is to lead authentically, steadily and with the sense of purpose. We will remain true to our strategy, maintaining world class employee safety, acting with uncompromising ethics and integrity, supporting the communities in which we live and work and steadfast in our commitment to building a more sustainable world. Due to the fundamental building blocks that drive sustainable, differentiated financial performance for our shareholders now and in the long term. With this context in mind our core operating principles through this downturn are clear. First, protecting the safety and security of our people is paramount. And here I'll start saying that we've retained more than 95% of talented workforce annually for over a decade. And a strong and talented employee base is the most important factor in creating great customer experiences and shareholder returns. We have benchmark levels of employee engagement which is core to our culture and values and this is differentiator that is often overlooked. Each time we survey our employees the top three things that are people identify with our culture engagement, our sustainability purpose and the believe that one company can change an industry and an industry can change the world. Second, it is the ethics and values we live and lead by and third it's safety. In fact, with regard to our safety record, I don't know of another company today with a better safety record than our own within or anywhere outside of our industry. Safety and respect for others are at the core of our value system. We went into the downturn as the premier climate control company and our relentless focus on continued high employee engagement will enable us to emerge on the other side of this downturn even stronger. Since the crisis, we've gone a great length to keep our people safe across the globe. It's not just about strict PPE protocols, dramatically increasing cleaning and disinfecting, we are implementing employee after screening and safe distancing protocols. It is about fundamentally rethinking the way tens of thousands people conduct their work in our offices, factories and warehouses and the reconfiguring them for safe distancing through actions such as reconstructing and rebalancing production lines, radically adjusting material and workflows. And investing in new equipment to adjust for new lifting and positioning requirements. And in every facet of how our people work and move throughout our facilities. We\u2019re also actively helping our employees and communities with financial assistance through this challenging time, through supporting national and local community organizations. And through our employee funded Trane Technologies helping hands fund. We\u2019re in a strong financial, balance sheet and liquidity position, and we\u2019ll continue to generate powerful free cash flow. We will utilize our strength to play aggressive offence throughout the downturn. We have a strong management team, a proven operating system, and confidence we can execute our downturn scenario playbook to limit decrementals in-line with our gross margins. We announced the RMT transaction of Gardner Denver early in 2019, by mid-2019, well ahead of the pandemic; we created an office of transformation that reports directly to me. Blueprinting the organizational design and developing transformational margin of proven opportunities for the pure-play Trane Technologies of the future. Stack of projects relating to these margin improvement opportunities are progressing well and many are underway. We\u2019re looking forward to discussing these opportunities in detail on the Analyst Day which is still slated for the fall, whether that\u2019s in person or virtually. The transformation office also oversees a stranded cost reduction programs, and this downturn has created had opportunity to accelerate the elimination of stranded costs. We have now identified $90 million in permanent structural cost savings that we expect to take effect in 2020 with run rate savings in 2021 of $110 million. Lastly, I personally find it useful to continue to look at the future through a holistic sustainability lens. First, sustaining the health, welfare, personal development in future of our talented people around the world. Next keeping our communities safe, healthy and thriving. And finally, of course, business sustainability which means managing the business for the long term, including the opportunity we have to invest and build our capabilities even in this downturn, so we can emerge with an even wider competitive advantage. We have a tremendous opportunity to make this happen. In fact, looking back at the last downturn in 2008, we couldn\u2019t be in a more different and preferential position in comparison, but better suited to capitalize on advantages. Now let me turn the call over to Dave to discuss Covid-19 and our proactive response of the crisis in more detail, Dave? David Regnery : Thanks Mike, please go to Slide 5. During the quarter the patient which Covid-19 pandemic changed the economic landscape is unparalleled. Moving from region to region, impacting our employees, customers and communities as it spread. We\u2019re trying technologies we began in early January forming prices management teams to confirm the pandemic. With employee\u2019s safety as our number one priority. As we moved into February, we closed all our facilities in China. We proactively began addressing employee safety. As Mike alluded to on the previous slide, the safety measures were more than just providing PPE. We took a holistic look at how we work. Our teams proactively reconfigured our facilities to address the pandemic. We changed the way production lines flow, replacement of machine operators and created physical barriers where necessary. We implemented active screening, staggered break times, and increased cleaning measures. And frequency of cleaning measures and expedited PPE. By March, as we ramped up production in China with protective measures in place, the work of reconfiguring our facilities moved to EMEA and the Americas. We proactively sent employees home and ensured their pay would be held whole to reduce the number of employees in our facilities, to deliver essential customer orders only. This increased the safety for our employees and greatly reduced our facility output to provide time to implement the necessary safety measures fully in each facility. To be clear these safety measures were not limited to our plants. We proactively addressed employee safety in our distribution centers, offices and parts stores. All facilities were in scope. By the time April began, our plants in Asia-Pacific completed their ramp-up. Our plants in EMEA and the Americas began to ramp their production. And we expect most plants would be fully ramped early in May. Throughout the quarter our supply chain crisis management team, proactively worked with our suppliers, as they address their own Covid-19 challenges. The team continues on a daily cadence to manage potential risks. This team has done an excellent job. As we move into May, we are running with new line rates, and protocols and adjusting to meet customers\u2019 demands. Please go Slide 6, from the start Trane Technologies has been addressed in the crisis by bringing expertise, technology and services to their and critical applications for hospitals and other healthcare facilities like clinics, research laboratories and pharmaceutical production. By ensuring proper air treatment, filtration, ventilation and decontamination, we\u2019re helping to keep patients and healthcare workers safe and more comfortable in the most challenging situations. We are providing and maintaining indoor air qualities through solutions such as trained catalytic air cleaning systems which removed pathogens from air streams. And negative pressurization systems to isolate infections. Our remote monitoring controls and building intelligent solutions are increasingly important in an environment of social distancing. These technologies enable technicians to remotely monitor, inspect and troubleshoot systems to keep critical environments running safely and efficiently. Our Transport Refrigeration Solutions are protecting the cold chain and helping to ensure the safe and reliable delivery of perishable food, medicines and other critical goods. Through telematics, we're putting data to work with the ability to track and trace deliveries across fleets, monitor the location of assets and the temperature of individual deliveries in transit. Please turn to Slide 7; Trane Technologies has been addressing the impact of the pandemic on our communities. Established a number of years ago in response to natural disasters and funded by donations from our own employees. The Trane Technologies Helping Hand Fund is providing financial assistance to our own team members around the world dealing with financial hardship as a result of the pandemic. According to our Feeding America partners food donations in this environment have declined by nearly 60% in response through our Trane Technologies Foundation, we made a $100,000 contribution to Feeding America. And our team stepped up to help out with the effort. In one example, our Thermo King and Commercial HVAC Americas team joined forces with Feeding America and a hand up international to host to drive through pantries in Lynn Haven, Florida, providing more than \u00a3120,000 of food to nearly 6,000 people. Additionally, teams are upgrading operating rooms, air handlers, preparing patient isolation areas and expanding Covid-19 treatment facilities for hospitals in record time. I am proud of how our team focused on employee\u2019s safety, and supported our customers and communities in response to this crisis. And I am confident they will continue to address the challenges presented by the pandemic as we move forward. And now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Chris to discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks Dave. Please turn to slide number 8. As Mike mentioned, at the outset of the call, we are operating from a position of financial strength as we move through un-chartered territory in 2020. We have a strong balance sheet, excellent liquidity, and it maintains solid investment grade ratings over many years. Additionally, our consistent track record of delivering free cash flow of equal to, or better than, 100% of adjusted net income over time, with a five-year average of 107%, including an outstanding year in 2019, which delivered 118% further bolsters our strong financial position. The timing of the close of the Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Gardner Denver, on February 29th, 2020, and the receipt of $1.9 billion in cash also provided significant liquidity, owing to the rapid pace, both organizations tirelessly worked to finalize the transaction in 10 months\u2019 time. That money has been received and is reflected in our March 31st cash balance. In addition to cash on hand, we have full access to our revolving credit facilities, the first $1 billion facility expires in March of 2021, and we expect to refinance this prior to maturity, the second $1 billion facility matures in April of 2023. Even if we were to fully utilize both facilities, we would remain well below our primary debt covenant of 65% debt to capital. Both facilities were undrawn at March 31st and remain undrawn today. Lastly, we run a relatively CapEx like business model, so our capital requirements are pretty modest at around 1% to 2% of revenues. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Dave, to provide details and color on what we saw in our end markets in the first quarter. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks Chris, please turn to slide number 9. Broadly speaking our HVAC markets remained healthy in the first quarter, with pre-pandemic bookings and revenues largely in line with our full expectations. As the pandemic progressed across the globe bookings and revenue were heavily impacted, first in Asia-Pacific followed by EMEA then the Americas. In each region our proactive safety measures temporarily limited our uptime and our utilization. Despite the pandemic, our commercial HVAC Americas business delivered strong broad-based growth with bookings up mid-teens and revenue up mid-single digits. We saw strong demand in datacenters and from institutional customers across education, government and healthcare. Our residential HVAC business also saw strong demand with bookings up mid-single digits. With strong bookings growth in commercial and residential Americas HVAC backlog was up double digits versus first quarter of 2019. The majority of the backlog is applied systems which typically have lead times of 6 to 12 months. Our transport business was heavily impacted by the pandemic in each region. Accelerating declines already expected from the correction cycle that began last year, I'll give a more detailed update on our transport business later in the presentation. With the Covid-19 pandemic impacting EMEA for most of March, our team saw low single digit declines in both bookings and revenue. Despite the pandemic, Europe commercial HVAC bookings and revenue were up low single digits. During the quarter, Asia-Pacific was hit first and hit hardest by the pandemic with bookings and revenue down double digits. Given the pervasive impacts of the crisis, I'll give additional insights to our end markets later in the presentation based on order patterns we saw in the month of April. And now I'll turn it back to Chris to discuss the results for the quarter. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks again, Dave. Please go to Slide 10. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic significantly impacted our first quarter financial results as we took actions to protect employees and customers. As Dave mentioned on the previous slide prior to the pandemic, our global revenues in the first quarter started off largely in line with our full-year expectations. However, pandemic impacts limited our global equipment and service revenues by approximately $150 million in the quarter with almost two-thirds of the impact in Asia-Pacific contributing to our 5% organic revenue decline. Adjusted EBITDA margins were down 60 basis points in the quarter primarily due to margin impacts from the volume declines related to both the pandemic and the transport correction cycle. Negative product mix in the Americas more than offset positive price versus cost. As we delivered mid-single digit revenue growth IN commercial HVAC as compared to approximately 30% revenue declines in transport. We implemented proactive cost controls across the business and accelerated our stranded cost reduction actions contributing to a $16 million reduction in unallocated corporate costs and positive productivity versus other inflation in the quarter. Please go to Slide 11. During Q1, we delivered enterprise deleverage within gross margin rates on lower volume by managing all elements of the P&L including our decisive actions to accelerate cost reduction programs. Within the Americas region, our transport revenues were down approximately 30% as the correction cycle in the end markets was accelerated by the pandemic. Americas margins were heavily impacted by both the volume and mix impacts of the transport revenue declines. Given the size of our Americas operations, our commitment to proactively invest in employee safety and security in our plants, distribution centers, offices and parts stores added necessary costs and reduced absorption in the quarter negatively impacting margins. Margins EMEA and Asia-Pacific were both impacted by top-line headwinds related to the pandemic. In each region swift action and strong execution of cost reduction programs limited deleverage to within gross margin rates. Please go to slide 12. As Mike discussed in his opening remarks given the onset of Covid-19, we're aggressively stepping up our efforts to remove $100 million in stranded costs related to the reverse Morris Trust Transaction we closed in Q1. After announcing a transaction in April last year, we quickly mobilized a margin improvement and transformation office by mid-summer to focus on these cost reductions, which gave us a nice head start in determining the best, most value accretive ways to eliminate these costs while simultaneously improving the overall capabilities and margin expansion opportunities across our businesses. We quickly moved to implement zero based budgeting processes and principles across the company. Entering 2020, we set a cost reduction target of $40 million in a year of the total $100 million in stranded costs. We looked for opportunities to accelerate the pace of savings in the first quarter and with the onset of Covid-19 saw an opportunity to push ourselves further. To date, we've identified savings of approximately $90 million to be realized in 2020 more than double our original target. Further heading into 2021, the actions we will have taken in 2020 should yield permanent run rate savings of approximately $110 million in 2021. Of the total $90 million savings in 2020, we expect about $70 million to come from corporate unallocated expenses and approximately $20 million to come from the segments. Lastly, we previously disclosed we would incur one-time costs of approximately $100 million to $150 million to permanently eliminate the $100 million in stranded costs and the table on the bottom rights of the slide shows our status to date. We spent approximately $31 million in Q1 we will update you quarterly on our progress. Please go to Slide 13, we remain committed to balanced capital deployment going forward as we have consistently done for many years. Given the unpredictability of depth and duration of the downturn related to Covid-19, we wanted to highlight the modest adjustments we have made for 2020 and equally important highlight the things that have not changed. As Mike outlined, we are going to manage through this downturn from a position of financial strength. We see this as a time to lead and a time to aggressively invest in our most important asset, our employees. We also see this as a time to aggressively invest and to solidify or extend our market leading positions through value-accretive investments that will make us an even stronger company coming out of this crisis than when we went in. Importantly, we expect to maintain our dividend at current levels for 2020 and have already paid the quarterly dividend for the first quarter and declared the quarterly dividend for the second quarter. We expect to pump the brakes on share repurchases in the second quarter, while maintaining optionality down the road. Regarding debt obligations, we committed to and paid $300 million in April to retire debt at maturity and we expect to pay down the next debt obligation of $300 million at maturity in February of 2021. We will continue to evaluate strategic value-accretive M&A. lastly; we expect to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating. This offers us continued optionality as markets evolve. And now I'll turn it back to Dave to give an update on current Q2 trends. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks Chris. Please go to Slide 14. During the month of April, we've seen global orders down approximately 20%. Looking across the regions, orders in the Americas and EMEA were both down over 20% Asia-Pacific orders were also down but under 20% as China demand is near prior year levels. Given the normal seasonality of our business and continued deterioration in economic indicators, it is unknown that these order trends will further deteriorate, stabilize or improve. In the Americas, demand for our commercial applied products has been more resilient particularly for essential end markets including warehousing, datacenters and healthcare. Unitary demand has been softening. Broadly speaking during a downturn our service and parts businesses typically sees strengthening demand as customers choose to extend the life of their HVAC equipment rather than replace it. Since this downturn is driven by a pandemic traditional HVAC services and parts demand have been limited due to access constraints at customer sites. Conversely, the pandemic has driven additional demand for our intelligence services which include remote building monitoring and indoor air quality offerings. In the residential market approximately 80% of our sales are replacement units. Impacts from the pandemic have caused declines in consumer confidence and increases in unemployment, our two main replacement market indicators. Though the overall demand is down, we are seeing order for both lower SEER products that appeal to value customers and higher SEER products that appeal to customers looking to improve indoor air quality as more people are working from home. I'll speak about our transport market outlook on the next slide. Our EMEA markets are seeing similar disruption to what we are seeing in the Americas with France, Italy, Spain and Portugal being significantly impacted. In Asia Pacific, China demand is near prior year levels while market demand in India, Singapore Malaysia and Japan remained restricted. From an operations standpoint, we continued to proactively invest in employee safety across our facilities. Our plants in Asia have ramped up and our Americas and EMEA plants are ramping as we speak. Since China was the first area to be significantly impacted by Covid-19, we have received questions asking what lessons we've learned from our efforts in this region. Our number one learning was that early proactive safety measures are absolutely paramount and we have rolled out these measures globally. Second, consistent focused supply chain cadence is critical to support equipment production and service delivery. Those processes have been effective and implemented globally. And our final learning is that no two countries are the same. At this stage, it is unclear if other countries will track to a similar recovery path as China given the varied regional response to the pandemic. Finally, as we highlight it in our earnings released this morning, we are temporarily suspending our formal guidance and expect to re-evaluate for Q2 earnings. Please go to Slide 15. Covid-19 has created obvious disruptions in the majority of our end markets as outlined on the prior slides. The near-term impacts on the transportation markets have been even more significant. On our Q4 call, we provided a good level of detail on our expectations for the transportation market in 2020. Today, I would like to dive a little deeper and provide market forecasts for North America and EMEA for each of the major product categories with truck, trailer and APU broken out separately. The Covid-19 impacts on the transport markets in 2020 are pronounced, with dramatic forecasts reductions across all major product categories in both North America and EMEA. For North America, the trailer forecast has dropped from down 25% in January timeframe to down 46% as of a week ago. The North America APU forecast has moved from down 33% to down nearly 60% for 2020 while the truck forecast has dropped from down 3% to down nearly 20%. Likewise, Europe truck and trailer forecast declines have nearly doubled as well. Additionally, while we don't have the same level of reliable detailed forecasts available for the other businesses, including marine, bus and rail. These markets are down similar numbers as well. As you might expect, COVID-19 has dramatically slowed global demand in food distribution, which support hard hit businesses like restaurants. And long-haul trucking has been significantly impacted by the slowing of the overall global economic demand and cross border shipping. Aftermarket parts the showing resilience, and demand is expected to continue to be solid, as companies look to extend the life of their existing fleets. In terms of the timing of the pandemic impacts on transport, we're generally seeing encouraging booking rates through the first two months of the year that supported our initial transport outlook for 2020 that we provided on our fourth quarter earnings call. As we moved through March and the pandemic started shutting down major portions of the economy, booking rates dropped significantly consistent with the updated forecast view on the slide. Today in April, we're seeing very slow bookings, as most trucking companies have hit the pause button on activity to reflect the significant downturn in the economy and across major sectors of the refrigerated truck, trailer in APU markets as I discussed earlier. The forecast for the second quarter for North America trailers, for example is down approximately 80% from 2019. April-to-date, our bookings across Transport Americas for equipment is down about 80%, which is consistent with that outlook. While aftermarket is relatively flat with prior year. The ACT forecast has been revised lower several times since the pandemic hit. So it's really too early to call how 2020 ultimately will play out. As states reopen and economic activity gradually returns to normal, we expect demand to significantly pick up from current levels as well. ACT initially called for a market correction in 2020, and then a return to growth in 2021. And that still seems directionally correct. Although COVID-19 impacts are likely driving a deeper and more prolonged market correction, and a more cautious and gradual return to growth. And now I'll turn it back to Mike. Mike Lamach : Thanks, Dave. Please go to Slide 16. Our strong financial condition, balance sheet and liquidity enable us to operate from a position of strength throughout the COVID-19 crisis, as demonstrated through two significant revenue downturn scenarios. The first down 15% and the second down 25%. And to reiterate, because I've heard there has been some confusion in other company earnings calls. These are not our forecasts, they're just scenarios. We want to have a response under any scenario, given the tremendous uncertainty that exists in the near term. And we want to assuage investor concern by showing a breakeven free cash flow analysis in the minus 25% scenario. What's important to note, however, is that in both scenarios, we have the financial strength to weather the storm, pay dividends, and continue to follow our core principles? We are going to remain true and uncompromising to our purpose driven sustainability strategy. And our core values, including employee safety and well-being and corporate citizenship in our communities. Anyone who knows our company and our culture knows that this is something we believe in at our core. It's who we are, and it's how we win. It's what has driven strong shareholder returns over the past decade since the last downturn and what we believe is a proven formula for sustainable, strong shareholder returns in the future. We're also going to play aggressive offense. We see this downturn as an opportunity to invest, expand market share, extend our leadership as the premier climate control company and emerge from the crisis even stronger than when we went in. We're going to continue to execute our playbook and take appropriate cost actions. We are going to be very strategic in our application. Our objective isn't to maximize 2020 earnings is to build a Trane Technologies of the future and to win big over the long term. Please go to Slide 17. Our long-term strategy remains unchanged and it's underpinned by strong secular, sustainability mega trends. Our end markets, our strategy, and our products and services are all tied to the undeniable fact that the world is getting warmer, cities are becoming more densely populated, and the demand for fresh food is accelerating. Fundamentally, we excel with these global mega trends and sustainability intersect with our innovation and capabilities which drives high demand for products and services and while short term demand maybe impacted or pushed out, longer term, the challenge is the secular mega trends present will not abate and require leadership and action post COVID-19. We also know that the post COVID-19 world will evolve and adapt to the new reality and experiences we've gained through this crisis. Accurate design, installation, service and monitoring of HVAC systems will be more important than ever to ensure proper filtration, ventilation, air flows and pressurization in high density areas and especially in critical environments like hospitals, food and pharma, office buildings, hotels and homes, buses and other modes of mass transportation, remote monitoring, diagnosis and artificial intelligence based service models have the potential for exponential growth and new service models will emerge. These are just a sliver of the potential opportunities we see now and we intend to evolve, adapt and capitalise on them. In the near term, we strongly believe it's imperative that premier companies like Trane Technologies lead through this crisis authentically, steadily and with a sense of purpose. We will remain true to our strategy built on the fundamental building blocks that drive sustainable, differentiated finance performance for shareholders now and in the long term. We also see this downturn as an opportunity to invest, expand market share, and extend their leadership into emerge with an even stronger culture and a stronger company than ever before. Even in the current crisis, we're confident and excited about the future of Trane Technologies, and our ability to bring all of our considerable resources to bear to deliver strong, sustainable returns for our shareholders. I want to thank our dedicated employees around the world for supporting all that is essential to fight this pandemic and all the frontline caregivers that are heroically battling for all of us every day. And with that, Chris, Dave, and I'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open. ScottDavis: Hi, guys. Good morning, guys. Hope you can hear me, okay? Well, good morning. Thanks for the detail. It's super helpful, but I'm kind of intrigued by this whole indoor air quality theme overall. And I guess the question really is what did the building owners care? Is there a sense of urgency outside of obviously hospitals have always cared? But when you think of the other categories that you sell into is there - your phone's lighting up that people say, wow, we need to do a retrofit project here or is it just too early to really say? MikeLamach: Yes. Scott, it's too early to say, but we're looking at just sort of human behavior and in the lasting effects of what a pandemic would do to society and we see a little bit happening through our lens in China, although you can't draw exact parallels between the two. One thing for sure is that the ability to really monitor your indoor air quality and to design and make sure that from a maintenance perspective and all the controls and automation that go into making sure that it's effectively working, I think you're going to see sort of more density per square foot of all that and perhaps codes that in some parts of the world, which may have not been you know up to us I think which standard I think will change, as well food transportation codes and standards change I think going forward as well. So probably when you get through this it puts an importance. And I think particularly as buildings become tighter and tighter in terms of their design, I am talking about the envelop with the building, it\u2019s so critical to make sure that you\u2019re having fresh air exchange in the building, a typical building depending on what it does, might have half a dozen to dozens of 100% air changes in an hour. And the ability to make sure that\u2019s happening and that you\u2019re killing pathogens in - or you can in the system, or pressuring appropriately or diffusing air, or diluting air is going to be even more critical. So I think it bears a lot of opportunity going forward. I mean it's hard to - we did get through this right now, but I think the other round of it probably has more opportunity than not. ScottDavis: Okay, good. And then I am just kind of curious of the confidence that you have in your backlog. I would assume that 7% of your backlog includes things like hotels and stuff like that, that I would think risk of not just delays but the cancellation. So perhaps just a sense of what\u2019s your confidence in the backlog is overall. DavidRegnery: Scott, this is Dave. So we\u2019re pretty confident in our backlog especially in the HVAC space, a lot of it is in the applied world. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of cancellations there, its - we actually haven\u2019t seen many at all, it\u2019s pretty normal. Our TK backlog, a little bit more concerned with that. We have seen some cancellations, but it's pretty low right now. So, overall I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty confident around the globe in our backlog and we haven\u2019t seen anything that would lead us to believe that won\u2019t happen. MikeLamach: Yes, Scott. If you think about, you mentioned hotels, but you could throw like retail. That\u2019s a small part of our business, I mean retails is an example, we\u2019ve never over last decade focused much on national accounts at all, as an example. And so if you think about our relatively high share in Unitarian and light unitary, the smallest share by design we would have, would be in retail. And if you go into hotels, the place where we play in hotels is sort of in the lobby and in the common areas. And in the larger and more complicated spaces, we really don't play in sort of individual rooms. And so the vacancy of a hotel isn't going to matter if the hotel's open, we're going to be providing equipment and services. So that is a little different, maybe a decade ago I would have said we would have had more focus on retail and national accounts and that's changed over the decade. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprig from Vertical Research. Your line is open. JeffSprague: Thank you. Good day everyone. Yes, my pleasure. Just first on the kind of working through these scenarios and what you're planning to do. Just want to be clear. The comment about managing the detrimental around gross margin would require extra actions. Are you planning to take those actions? Are you suggesting to us that none of us has a crystal ball but pick our revenue scenario and we should expect your detrimental to be around your gross margin rate? MikeLamach: Yes, that's a great question. And the first thing I would tell you is that, anybody that thinks they're going to forecast a number is only going to be surprised when the forecast meets the real world, the first minute. So the notion of really doing scenario planning is something that we've been living with for a long, long time. And although we would have done scenario planning in the past, it would have been around a general recession. So a pandemic is something new with regard to just the behavioral changes in the way that say in our case buildings would even be closed or limited in terms of access for service. And so, the pandemic, it's offered really sort of a different scenario. But once you move through the initial pandemic phase and we think through to Scott\u2019s earlier question, where the opportunities lie going forward. It's more useful than to think about scenarios, and what open now which is done or adapt from duration of that recession. So, for us, we've looked at, I would say in increments of five points of revenue decline. One of the series of actions that we would need to take on top of the actions are already taken and hence having a playbook to do that and give us some confidence that we can maintain a reasonable amount gross margin, detrimental would be in line with that. But in doing that, we don't think there's an opportunity that we\u2019re even doubling down in areas of innovation or doubling down in areas of productivity. Because the key to this for us is, we entered this thing, I think with a pretty wide gap relative to some of the competition and we want to come out of this with an even wider gap. And we've never been in a better position from liquidity and a talent and a technology perspective to be able to do that. So, it would be a tragedy not to really invest but things at once we can manage the decrement polls, and we can continue to really double down the important investments for growth and productivity. JeffSprague: And as an unrelated kind of follow on second question. Mike, you mentioned M&A kind of prominently in your - you give us a little thought of what you're interested in, kind of the priorities for the newco on standalone basis here? MikeLamach: Yes, it's always the strategy what needs to drive M&A and so the idea is that we would 80%, 90% of the ideas that we have would be really defined by the strategy and that hasn't changed around technology and channel for us and they tend to be really in buckets. It's the easy bolt-on technology is that need a channel or it's the channel that adding our technology would make that channel really work. Those are easy for us to do. I would tell you that are something that we're still very active with. I think some of the larger more transformative things that a company could do like ours. I think the bid ask is widened in this environment, but it makes sense over time really to have liquidity in the balance sheet to be able to look at those sorts of things if in fact, the bid ask narrow. In fact, they become attractive so we would keep all options on the table and again, this is about playing aggressive offence where we can. In a way, Jeff, our timing was unlucky. We caught a large acquisition and had hung bridge loan in April and we couldn't have been in a worse position and then you fast forward and between announcing and closing the RMT transaction in 10 months or what couldn't have been any better. And so, we really need to capitalize on that good fortune and make sure that we're parlaying that into a really good future that we can invest for the long run. Operator : Your next question from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open. SteveTusa: Hey guys, good morning. What was in total Thermo King down on revs for the quarter? MikeLamach: Americas I think Dave it was down - \u2026 DavidRegnery: This is down about 30% and EMEA down out 10%, 15%, I think it was. SteveTusa: Okay. Got it. And I think you guys had said that the total, you said something about mid single-digit growth in commercial was at the total commercial business in the quarter? DavidRegnery: We talked about the EMEA, I am sorry, the Americas number was up the mid sing digit, correct. EMEA was slightly down and that was really driven by the Middle East, actually Europe was up. And Asia Pacific was the hardest hit, Steve, by the pandemic as it obviously hit there first. And it was down double-digits. SteveTusa: Right. And in global services, you mentioned it was weak kind of across the board, what was that for globally just services for HVAC? DavidRegnery: Yes, obviously, it was down in Asia Pacific. Globally it just did not perform as well as we thought it should have. Actually, flattish in the Americas but again we expect more out of that and we have had some disruption getting on job sites really in all aspects of the service business, whether it be service agreements, whether it be break fix, we have had some disruption. But with that said, Steve, I want you to take away, we've also saw some opportunities on it with our intelligent services and we've been added a long-time getting buildings connected. And we have over 20,000 buildings connected now and really seeing the benefit there. Customers are really seeing the benefit of being able to have those buildings serviced remotely. And diagnose if there's something wrong. As Mike said indoor air quality and in buildings is obviously there's a lot of talk about that. It's a very important aspect of our business. We're really good at it. There is lot of science around it and as office buildings around the world start ramping back up our service techs is on call to make sure we could help our customers. SteveTusa: One more quick one, just on the earnings bridge. Kudos to you guys for giving some sub segment detail. Mike thanks for that. But you guys don't give the earnings bridge anymore. What was kind of price material inflation on a margin basis year-over-year this quarter? ChrisKuehn: Steve, this is Chris. We were positive on a price and a cost basis on the margin bridge. And to your comments, I think that Margin Bridge has really served us well in the past when we've had, especially the last couple of years, higher tariffs and higher inflation, consciously going forward, we want to make sure we can tell the story of what's happening on a quarterly basis. So, we want to make sure we do that without the confines of a bridge. But to your question, price cost was positive, the quarter productivity was probably was positive, versus other inflation, although that's where we also saw some of the investment in our COVID-19 measures. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open. AndrewKaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for all the color. Mike, China back to flattish demand year-over-year is relatively quick. Can you give us more color on the type of demand you're seeing? Is it more the indoor air quality products and services buildings need to be serviced or is it more delayed larger orders coming back? MikeLamach: Yes, I'm going to give that to Dave here. But let me kick off just a thought kind of going forward. Our business in China really is on institutional, large commercial equipment with the growing service business that service businesses, a quarter to a third of the mix, which of course, was heavily impacted. So, we recognize revenue when we ship like a chiller, or we recognize revenue when we complete a service engagement and build a client. So, there's very little progress billing or percent complete accounting that would go on smooth that out. So, it would look outsized for us because, we weren't shipping chillers. I mean, conversely, the backlog of chillers to ship in China is fairly substantial. And I think what Dave will tell you are that we're seeing it returned back to prior levels at this point. DavidRegnery: Yes, Andrew, we have the incoming order rate for April was actually as we're still rolling up the numbers here looks like it's going to be a little bit favourable to last year, there is probably some pent-up demand there. I would tell you though, that as we track our pipeline, and this is the orders that haven't yet been booked, but they're actively being quoted, the pipeline is actually starting to show positive movements as well and that's, that's really what we start looking at is the pipeline, because that's a really good indicator as to what future activity would be. We're still watching it. But April was - April's a good sign and well, certainly a lot of attention to it in the in the rest of the quarter. AndrewKaplowitz: So that's very encouraging. I did want to follow up on services. You mentioned that being flat in Q1 a little disappointing. Is services going to outpace the 20% decline that you're talking about for Q2 and do you see services starting to snap back and the economy started turn on or is it too early to see that at this point? DavidRegnery: Yes, No. I mean and maybe a little bit early to see that. But first of all, your first question, yes, we do see services outperforming the equipment in the second quarter, so it will not be down 20%. We expect that to be hopefully more in the flattish range. Your second question, do we see opportunities in services? Absolutely, one of the things that as we talked about our playbook if we have a downturn, one of the things that we're protecting is our expertise in service really around our service technicians. We're kind of ring fencing that to say that that's an area we're not going to go we're going to try to cut costs. We're protecting that because we know that as the economy snaps back, and individuals start going back to offices to work, indoor air quality is going to be super important and how you're able to help those customers understand air quality and have solutions for them. We're really going to leverage our service business in that way. MikeLamach: Yes. Andy, I would say that clearly a service business is not an antidote to a pandemic, it is an antidote to recession and as we moved through pandemic concerns into whatever the new normal would be going forward for building occupancy and services absolutely, we would expect to see as we have in every downturn, every recession, you're going to see capital extended and here in particular, you're going to have large commercial, large institutional customers looking at making sure that airflow air changes, diffusion, dilution, pressurization filters, are all going to be in tip top shape. So, really for us, I think that that's going to Dave's point, require every technician we've got, and it's going to require more connected buildings because customers are going to want that service as opposed to people that don't need to be in your building, right. I mean, there's no point in coming out to a facility if you don't need to if you can diagnose it first in advance and maybe even fix it remotely, which often we can do. That's going to be an opportunity. And that's a great way for us to deliver service at even higher margins and physically delivering services. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open. JulianMitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just the first question on the decremental margins. So understood that firm wide, you're aiming for that or think you can hold the line at that sort of 30 percent-ish level like you had in Q1? But clearly, I think mix can play a massive role in swing that round. Your Americas decrementals in Q1 were quite a bit higher than the gross margin for example. So maybe help us understand what mix assumptions you have for the balance of the year. And whether you are very confident that you can offset swings in mix with cost actions. MikeLamach: Yes, Julian. First of all, in Americas, somewhat $40 million revenue differential. So the absolute dollars are relatively small for the size of the business. Actually that the detrimental is there. The cause - the first cause was not the mix with transport or the mix of service. It was really the response we took with regard to the COVID crisis. And just to give you a sense, if you ever wonder if we actually walked the talk in terms of what we say about our values around safety, we always think about March being half of the quarter. And we always think about the last week of March being half of March. And so a quarter-over-quarter if you follow all that math is the last week of March. We actually pulled the end on cord, March 23 and shut down all of our factories in Europe and in the Americas. And prioritize only the orders that were essential going into fighting COVID. And that would have ranged in 10% to 15% of the orders. We had a couple of factories where for a short time; it might have been 40% of the orders. During that time of course, you lose that absorption. But when we sent people home, we sent them home and topped up their pay to make sure they're paid their full wages or the equivalent. So any gap with any unemployment benefits would have been topped up. We made all the wage increases around the globe for any hourly associate or any service technician proceeded as planned. So we didn't delay those. We actually put them through as planned. We reclassified our medical plan. So that COVID testing and preventive care would be at no cost to employees that telemedicine visits will be added at no cost to our employees. We amended our 401-k plan. So not only do we not cut our 401-k match, we amended our plans to make sure that people could take out up to $100,000 in delayed loan repayments for a year. We provided backup childcare and elder care programs for people with minimal, very small copays so that they could come to work takes some of the stress off. We extended our employee assistance program with programs for financial emotional, legal, and other support and hardships. And so all those things are things we took but the biggest cost was taking some 25,000 jobs. And literally reconfiguring all the lines and workstations and then making sure we had all the PPE in before people came back to work. And so all of that was so that we can go faster in the long run. And people would feel safer. And when people feel safe, they come to work. There's not absenteeism. We're not shutting down factories to clean them. And that is where cost came in. So, you look at the job in Asia, the job in Europe and deleverage in the teens and look at the Americas on the small revenue, kind of decline of $40 million. And I don't want anybody to read too much into that. So before we start talking about taking costs out, which we've got all the actions loaded. And we can talk about that, if you'd like. You have to think about sort of doing the right thing, which is what we did and what we always would do, and we will do, and I would make that decision every single time if given that decision again. JulianMitchell: Thank you. That's reassuring to hear. Maybe just one quick follow up. And maybe it's for Michael or for Chris. On Slide 16, you've got the helpful scenarios laid out. If I look at say, scenario one sale down about 15% flow through the decremental you've talked about maybe it's a 30% drop in EBIT or EBITDA. It looks like in that scenario; the free cash flow decline is maybe a bit heavier than the operating profit. Just wondering if I had that correctly, and whether I did or not what you\u2019re assuming for working capital within those cash flow scenarios. MikeLamach: I\u2019ll start, Julian, this is Mike. I would say that if you go back to the 09 timeframe, I want to say we were three times, 3x plus cash to net income. So, we know how to get cash out of the business in a significant downturn. So, I would look for extraordinary operating cash flow in a down 25 scenario. Just so, if you go back to the 09 timeframe, you get approve positive on that point. So I am not sure if that analysis that you\u2019re doing would be correct in that regard. Chris, do you want to add to that. ChrisKuehn: Yes, I\u2019ll add. I mean there is maybe a little bit of where it call little conservatives I mean the numbers as well, we\u2019re still investing capital at the normal levels you would have of 1% to 2% of revenues in both of those scenarios, Julian, whether the investments in employees or capital or otherwise that cash is there to go fund. So we can certainly talk offline, but I think that\u2019s a reasonable scenario for us right now, little bit conservatism in there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. JohnWalsh: Hi. Good morning. Wanted to go back to the service conversation and maybe find out how much of that business is really driven by contractual service versus needing to get onto the site and generating some type of spare part or something to drive the revenue. DavidRegnery: Yes, John it's a good question. On a contractual basis, our service business is about 30%, okay. And within that 30%, there are lots of different service contracts that we have. We have a whole portfolio of different contracts. So some include parts, some do not. So there is some parts demand that's generated from that 30%. Then you move into the break fix world where it's broken. They give us a call we come out and we fix in. And then you also have a planned maintenance where you'll actually proactively plan with the customer to do a major replacement or a major overhaul on a piece of equipment. MikeLamach: John, it breaks out to about even thirds on the service business. So if you'd look at it that way. ChrisKuehn: A Third, a third. JohnWalsh: Okay. Thank you for that. And then obviously in the Americas, depending on what state you're in, there are different rules around construction. But curious, once again, staying on the service topic, what you see in those states where there's a big shelter in place order and only essential work is getting done versus states where the restrictions might not be as stringent. Are you seeing real big bifurcation in how the businesses are acting in those? Is the right way, to think about going forward? MikeLamach: Yes, John, what I'd say, more than anecdotally if somebody is calling for service in the Americas right now, they're going to be in a critical infrastructure, a critical essential role. So, we're not getting phone calls from somebody, that's not operating or not running. So, we're in hospitals, we're in pharma, we're in food and bev, we're in datacenters would be a huge. That's the places where we are today. JohnWalsh: Great. Thank you for that. MikeLamach: And I don't know of any state really that's blocked, sort of that essential activities. So, even the most stringent states, obviously healthcare and such, we're in there servicing. Zac Nagel : Hey, Jason, do we have another question? Okay. I don't know if anyone can hear us, but that'll wrap up our call for today. We'll be around for any questions that you may have, please feel free to reach out to myself or to Shane and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning. And thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies' second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Chris Kuehn, Senior Vice President and CFO; and Dave Regnery, President and COO. With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Mike Lamach : Thanks, Zac. And thanks, everyone, for joining us on today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to start today's call with some perspective on the unprecedented level of change was seen around the world, both in business and in our personal lives over a time period of just a matter of months and why and how this is particularly relevant for Trane Technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted long-lived paradigms on what was considered normal and is exposed obvious truths about the many ways the old normal wasn't good enough. Normal has meant rapidly rising emissions and temperatures, creating a global climate crisis and pollution and poor health in many of our world's biggest cities where COVID-19 has had a disproportionately damaging impact in communities, where the demographics are most socioeconomically challenged. Normal has meant hunger, even though one-third of the global food supply is lost or wasted each year. And normal has meant inherent, systemic racism, injustice, and inequality. At Trane Technologies, we want to be part of creating a better new normal. We will challenge the status quo to create a new normal where communities thrive, where quality is foundational and where the environment is protected for future generations. We're putting a stake in the ground that Trane Technologies will lead by example, by setting historic and ambitious commitments and taking action to change our company, our industry, and the world. Our Gigaton Challenge commits to reducing our customers\u2019 carbon emissions by one gigaton or a billion metric tons by the year 2030. To give you an idea of the size and scale that's equivalent to about 2% of the world's annual emissions, and that's just our company alone. As other companies join in, we can bend the curve on global warming. We're also committed to creating opportunity for all, with a goal to achieve gender parity and leadership by 2030 and racial and ethnic diversity that is reflective of our communities. As Chair of the National Association of Manufacturers, I introduced a pledge for action, which the executive committee unanimously adopted on behalf of its 12,000 members focused on advancing opportunity for black people and other people of color through advocacy, education, training, and workforce development initiatives. We're having important dialogue within our own organization and in our communities and how we can accelerate our efforts to combat racism and better support communities in need. This includes programs to eliminate hunger, sport education and economic mobility, and to increase affordable housing. Our transformation plan for Trane Technologies is another example of how we're creating a new, better normal for our team, customers and shareholders executing against the new blueprint that culminated in May, after 10 months of analysis and planning. Setting these and other bold plans in motion, our talented team around the world has exhibited all the commitment and passion for change that has marked our last decade. Our goal is simple, to create a new normal where opportunity is accessible for all, where healthy food, water and medicines are moved to people who need them, where emissions trend down and blue skies trend up. Our business sits right at the intersection of making those things happen. With our unique positioning as a focused climate innovator, transformed and fit-for-purpose, we can tackle these pressing and complex challenges and drive differentiated returns for shareholders. Moving to Slide 4, the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to present ongoing challenges to virtually every aspect of daily life. As much progress as we've made, this crisis is still very much with us and the questions we were all contemplating months ago regarding the depth and duration of the downturn and the speed and shape of the recovery, that's still very much a question. As we navigate through the pandemic of paramount importance is staying true to our culture, purpose and values for maintaining world-class employee safety as part of our DNA. The decisive and aggressive investments we made in the first quarter were important and necessary steps in order to bring all of our facilities online, operating efficiently and safely. As a result, today, we're up and running under new readiness protocols and well positioned to meet customer demand. Despite very challenging global markets, our teams remained focused and agile with strong execution and solid financial performance. We outperformed our end markets broadly and effectively managed deleverage within our gross margin target levels in all regions and in all business units. We continue to play aggressive offense in order to emerge stronger and to thrive as business conditions improve and new opportunities emerge. We maintained high levels of business reinvestment and innovation and growth programs through the second quarter. And we expect to aggressively invest in the second half. We're also accelerating our stranded costs and other fixed cost reduction initiatives to deliver more bottom line savings in both 2020 and beyond. We remain in an exceptional financial position with strong liquidity and balance sheet optionality, which are competitive differentiators for us. We have ample capacity to run the business, effectively deploy capital and remain nimble as market conditions evolve. We'll discuss this in more detail later in the presentation, but our best line of sight at this stage will put revenue somewhere between down 10% and down 15% for 2020. Better than illustrative scenarios we laid out in quarter one. Our strategy remains unchanged, secular mega trends of energy efficiency and sustainability are becoming more pressing every day. We excel at addressing these mega trends and challenging what is possible for a sustainable world, redefining a higher standard for what the world considers normal. This passion powers us forward to deliver top tier financial performance and differentiated returns for our shareholders. Please go to Slide 5, bookings and revenues were heavily impacted by the pandemic in all regions in the second quarter. In the Americas, the impacts of the pandemic continue to be far reaching and severe. Broadly speaking, the economy is slowly progressing forward, but the situation remains tenuous and provides limited visibility. In North America, our Commercial HVAC business has been relatively resilient through the second quarter, with bookings and revenues each down mid single-digits. Backlog continues to be strong and services are outperforming equipment. Our transport refrigeration business outperformed the overall market as it continues to move through a deep down cycle, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic. Bookings are showing signs of stabilization, although it's too early to say the market has stabilized. Revenues were down more than 40%, outperforming the market, which was down more than 50%. Our Residential HVAC business had low single-digit bookings decline, with distributor sell-through down mid single-digits. June saw record bookings and backlog and July is off to a very strong start. Turning into EMEA, Commercial HVAC bookings were down mid-teens, while revenues were down high single-digits. Services outperformed equipment with building access continuing to improve. EMEA transport was down approximately 20%, outperforming the broader transport markets, which were down approximately 40%. Asia-Pacific continues to be mixed. China is showing signs of improvement, having made the most progress against the pandemic. Growth in China was more than offset by declines in the rest of Asia, with developed countries generally recovering slowly, while many developing countries are lagging. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris to discuss the results for the quarter in more detail. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks Mike. Please turn to Slide number 6. The pandemic has continued to significantly impact both top and bottom line results. Mike provided a good overview of our top line results on the prior slide. So I'd like to focus my comments on the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA margins were down 80 basis points, primarily impacted by significant volume declines in the quarter. We continue to execute our recession playbook in the second quarter, evolving with market conditions. We delivered strong productivity and managed deleverage within gross margin target levels, despite lower volumes, fixed cost under absorption and other pandemic and volume related inefficiencies. We also maintained high levels of business reinvestment and continue to ramp up our facilities and further invest in employee safety measures. Price/cost remained positive in the quarter, while mix was a significant headwind, with steep declines in transport revenues in both the Americas and EMEA. There were a few other relatively modest puts and takes on margins and EPS that are outlined on the slide for your reference. Please turn to Slide 7. Turning to the regional segments, I'll once again focus my comments on margins, given Mike covered revenues earlier. In each region, strong productivity, partially offset volume declines, fixed cost under absorption, investments in employee safety and other business reinvestments and innovation in growth programs to deliver better than gross margin deleverage. Price/cost was largely favorable, while transport makes us a headwind on lower transport revenues. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave to provide details and color on what we saw in our end markets in the second quarter. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number 8. As we've discussed throughout the presentation, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have far reaching impacts across the global economy, as it continues to evolve, which limits our forward visibility into our key end markets. With that caveat, this slide endeavors to provide our best view of our end markets at this point in time. As we've highlighted, North America Commercial HVAC has been relatively resilient through the second quarter. Order rates continue to be soft, and we expect a continuation of this trend heading into the back half of 2020, given the high level of economic uncertainty that persists. Services typically hold up better than equipment on a downturn, as owners look to extend the life of existing equipment. And we're seeing signs of that during this pandemic. On the other hand, the number of pandemic related businesses and school closings or partial reopenings and generally low level of building occupancies are having a negative impact on services. We're also seeing high levels of interest in comprehensive indoor air quality assessments and momentum in this space continues to build. The universe of opportunity is huge based on billions of installed square footage that could ultimately be evaluated but the opportunity is still early stages. Our tremendous installed customer base and best-in-class sales and service capabilities put us in a strong competitive advantage as this market evolves. Longer-term fundamental energy efficiency and sustainability mega trends, underpinned sustained secular growth for these markets. We expect to outperform the markets in 2020, given competitive advantages throughout the value chain from channel to sales, to controls and digital services to the largest, most capable service organization in North America. Residential HVAC had mid-single-digit sell-through declines and Q2. Record bookings and backlog in June and July is off to a very strong start, which are positive indicators for this business near-term. Consumer economic indicators are mixed and volatile and unemployment remains at historic levels, which limits longer-term visibility. Transport markets continue to move through a cyclical downturn in 2020, amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. ACT most recent forecast for transport still has the second half of 2020, down more than 40%. We continue to expect to outperform the markets, but looking at a down 40% second half forecast suggest tough sledding ahead. Looking out into 2021 ACT continues to project a snapback in the North America trailer market of over 20%. In EMEA, given the depth and impact of the pandemic on many European countries, most major cities are taking a cautious day-by-day approach. For commercial HVAC, we see opportunities for overall market outperformance through our clear focus on our sustainability advantages, but overall visibility remains limited. In transport, we\u2019ve recently introduced new products such as the Advancer product, I'll discuss on the next slide. These products have clear competitive advantages that will be tailwinds as market conditions improved. Most recent forecast for the transport markets in EMEA have deteriorated dramatically from April's forecast, down almost 50% for trailers and down over 100% for trucks for 2020, further pressuring our second half transport outlook. We have a slide in the appendix on the transport markets, you may find useful. We've talked at length about Asia Pacific, while China continues to recover at a steady pace with strength in data centers, electronics, pharma and healthcare, the rest of Asia remains mixed and difficult to call when they will improve. Please turn to Slide number 9. We've been clear at Trane Technologies, we are playing aggressive offense during this downturn, in part through heavy investment in a robust pipeline of product innovation in growth programs. Today I'll highlight just four tangible examples that are emblematic of innovation, market-leading products and services, we're bringing to market. Indoor air quality is generating tremendous interest in the market. Our customers are turning to us for our expertise to improve the safety of their buildings and to build the confidence of their building occupants. In commercial HVAC, we're providing indoor air quality assessments, which are fact based data driven analysis on four key contributors to indoor air quality, contaminant source management, humidity control, filtration and fresh air intake. These assessments are not checked the box exercises. We check everything thoroughly. Some large campuses and manufacturing locations can take 100s of hours to complete. Once the assessment is completed, we work with our customers to implement a layered approach that balances the key contributors to indoor air quality, while finding opportunities to reduce energy intensity. The layered approach is fully customizable and might include modifications to control sequences, improve filtration or additional sensor that closely measure and adjust for changes in humidity and CO2. Our unmatched application expertise, direct service channel and remote services, uniquely positioned us to balance energy intensity and indoor air quality in a customized solution for each customer. Last week, our European commercial HVAC team announced our synthesis balanced for pipe chiller. The synthesis balance utilizes low global warming potential refrigerants to simultaneously heat and cool a building with zero direct greenhouse gas emissions. The synthesis balance can deliver hot water with temperatures over 150 degrees Fahrenheit to replace the need for a separate boiler, and is more than 350% more efficient than the boiler it replaces. Our European transport team recently introduced our next generation trailer technology, the Advancer, the Advancer has the lowest total cost of ownership and is the most sustainable trailer refrigeration unit on the market. The Advancer delivers 30% better fuel consumption than any other trailer unit and reaches its target temperature 40% faster and take 60% less energy to produce. We also recently launched our large truck hybrid series. Our hybrid truck refrigeration unit can operate in three different modes to meet our customer's needs. The system automatically selects the best operating mode depending on the circumstance to deliver up to 50% fuel savings, when operating in a hybrid mode. With unmatched operating flexibility, these hybrid units provide our customers full access to cities restricting or banning vehicles due to noise or diesel emissions. These are just a handful of the innovations we're bringing to market during the downturn. Making these types of investments through down cycles enables us to continuously expand our competitive position year-after-year. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris, to discuss our efforts to reduce our fixed cost base. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please go to Slide number 10. At the time we announced the industrial RMT transaction, we recognized that there would be approximately a $100 million of stranded costs from the transaction. We quickly mobilized the transformation office last year to remove $100 million of structural costs from the business by 2021. Our goal in January of this year was to eliminate $40 million of the $100 million in stranded costs in 2020. With the onset of COVID-19, we've significantly accelerated this timetable and total savings target. We now expect to eliminate the full $100 million of stranded cost target in 2020, a year ahead of schedule. In addition, the programs we're executing to achieve the $100 million in stranded cost reductions in 2020 are expected to yield run rate, fixed cost savings of $140 million in 2021. As we previously disclosed, we expect onetime expenses of approximately $100 million to $150 million to eliminate the $100 million in stranded costs. And the table on the bottom right of the slide shows our status to date. We have spent approximately $75 million year-to-date with $44 million in the second quarter. Please go to Slide number 11. We are operating from a position of financial strength as we move through 2020. We have a strong balance sheet, excellent liquidity and have maintained solid investment grade ratings over many years. Additionally, our consistent track record of delivering free cash flow of equal to, or better than 100% of adjusted net income over time with a five year average of 107% further bolsters our strong financial position. In addition to cash on hand, we have access to $2 billion in revolving credit facilities. During the second quarter, we refinanced $1 billion credit facility extending its maturity to 2022. The second $1 billion facility matures in April of 2023. Even if we were to fully utilize both facilities, we would remain well below our primary debt covenant of 65% debt to capital. Both facilities were undrawn at June 30th and remain undrawn today. Please go to Slide number 12. We remain committed to balance capital deployment, as we have consistently done for many years. We see this as a time to aggressively reinvest in our business and to solidify and extend our market leading positions through value accretive investments that will make us an even stronger company coming out of this crisis than when we went in. We expect to continue to pay a competitive and growing dividend, and I've already paid approximately $253 million in dividends year-to-date. To preserve liquidity, we paused share repurchases during the first half of 2020, entering the back half of the year, we will retain optionality for share repurchases as visibility improves. Regarding debt obligations, we paid $300 million in April to retire debt at maturity and expect to pay another $300 million to retire debt at maturity in February of 2021. We continue to evaluate strategic value-accretive M&A, we expect to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating, offering us continued optionality as markets evolve. Lastly, we remain committed to deploying 100% of excess cash to shareholders over time. And now, there are formal guidance remains suspended until market visibility improves. I'll turn it back to Mike to provide an update on the scenarios we presented last quarter. Mike? Mike Lamach : Thanks, Chris. Please go to Slide number 13. On our Q1 earnings call, we shared two revenue scenarios, one down 15%, one nearly down 25%, to demonstrate that under both scenarios, we remained in a strong financial position, continue to make investments in the business, fund the dividend and play aggressive offense during the downturn. Looking out towards the back half of the year at the current pace and progression of the reopening of global economies, we expect to outperform both of these scenarios unless the pandemic or some other unknown negative catalyst catapults the markets lower. Given current course and speed, our best view at this stage is to expect revenues to be down somewhere between 10% and 15%. We will continue to confidently and strategically execute our downturn scenario playbook operating from a position of financial strength, as we've done through the first half of the year. Please go to Slide 14. Energy efficiency and sustainability mega trends are only growing stronger as time passes. Fundamentally, we excel where these global mega trends and sustainability intersect with our innovation and capabilities, which drives high demand for our products and services. We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth. As Dave outlined with a few tangible examples, we intend to press our advantage during this downturn to leverage our strong financial and competitive positioning and to invest heavily in the future of Trane Technologies. Not only focused on relentless investments in innovation and growth, but investments in blueprinting and transforming into a leaner, fit for purpose, pure-play, climate innovator. The elimination by stranded costs and the execution of transformation initiatives that will fundamentally improve the margin profile of the company over the long-term. Lastly, we remain committed to dynamic and balance deployment of capital, and we have a long track record of both delivering strong free cash flow and deploying excess cash to deliver top tier shareholder returns over many years. And with that, Chris, Dave and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. John Walsh : Hi, good morning everyone. Mike Lamach : Good morning, John. Chris Kuehn : Good morning. John Walsh : Hi. I guess can we first start talking a little bit more about service, I guess maybe what would be contemplated in that scenario framework of down 10% to 15% for the back half as it relates to your service business and did you see kind of improving trends throughout the quarter as you were able to get access to buildings? Dave Regnery : Yes. Thanks for the question, John. This is Dave, I'll take a first shot and then Mike could add comments and Chris. During Q2, we saw equipment and services down really in every region and services was much more resilient than equipment. As the quarter progressed, if you remember at the end of the first quarter, we were talking about our service business being impacted by not being able to have access to buildings. As the quarter progressed, we had those safety protocols worked out with our customers, so that became much less of a problem. We still have a few areas in the world, maybe some countries in Asia where that's still a problem, but for the most part, we've overcome that. As far as your question on the outlook, we expect service 300 basis points to 400 basis points better than equipment in the back half. We are seeing a lot of interest in our service business in our indoor air quality assessments. And we're also seeing a lot of opportunities in service in our digital connections. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe just a question around the conversations you're having with customers and there is probably a wave one of decisions as it relates to a building, maybe it's air changeovers, cleaning. Wave two, I would think would be some more of the higher retrofits you talked about. Where do you think customers are on that decision process as it relates to maybe doing, larger, heavier renovation or retrofits of their systems for indoor air quality? Dave Regnery : Yes. I would tell you, we're going at this at a very holistic level, okay. So when we do an assessment, when we've been asked to do 1,000 of these assessments, it's really at a system level. So the first thing that we would do is we would come in and make sure that the system was in fact operating as it was designed, once that has been achieved, we start layering in different options for our customers to evaluate not only the indoor air quality, but also the energy intensity. And that could be things such as fresh air exchanges, if you're exchanging three times an hour, perhaps you want to move to five times an hour, filtration, if you're going to change your filters, what would that sequence look like? And what would the ramifications be to the rest of the system? We see a lot of people out there just changing filters that could solve a problem or it could actually cause an additional problem, meaning you could have too much friction in your air ducts, you won't be able to move air through it, thus causing less clean air into the indoor air quality assessment. So we take a very holistic view, we then go and we look at the energy intensity, because everything I just mentioned, filtration and fresh air exchanges tends to use more energy and we're working with our customers to find other ways to offset that energy. Mike Lamach : John, in some cases where the capacity of the systems, as Dave said, when you \u2013 you might increase filtration to a very high MERV filter, but the pressure drop across the filter may not support the ability for the fan, the fan may be under size or the casing. So the duct work could be under size, you can actually implode systems or blow up fan motors. And so it's the level of modeling and sophistication and retrofitting required for each unique situation. And that's, I think a tremendous advantage of us \u2013 our capability to be able to provide that. So as Dave said, there is really been 1,000 of assessments done. I assume we're going to be doing 1,000s more assessments for a long time. And it's such a big opportunity, it's hard to put a number on it, because you're talking about billions of square feet around the world and everybody's dealing with the same kinds of issues and problems. John Walsh : Great. Thank you. I'll pass it along. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mike Lamach : Hey, Joe. Dave Regnery : Hey, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Mike, maybe you can kind of touch on just the commercial market for a second, there is a lot of consternation out there regarding what non-resident structure is going to look like, through the end of this year and then into next year. And I'm wondering, one, if you could just kind of give some commentary on how you think things are going to play out and how your business is positioned? And then two, just as it relates to 2020, is there a possibility for some type of like budget flush from facilities? Because maybe they haven't spent as much money in the first half of the year and there is maybe some opportunity for additional spending in 2H. Mike Lamach : Hey, Joe. I\u2019ll start and I\u2019m going to give Dave a chance to put more color on that. But yes, look, I think that in terms of buildings reopening, there could be a need for buildings reopening to do service that's been deferred or delayed. But frankly, I think what'll take precedence over that is these indoor air quality assessments to make sure buildings actually can open and open safely. So, if you think about a strategy for returning to school, K312 in the U.S. would be a great example of that. It's not a function of just going in and doing deferred maintenance, it\u2019s a function of going in as Dave said and looking at if whether or not the systems are working to design or code or to standards or what might be done to provide more reassurances. And so, my sense would be that in some cases you could see what would have been preventative maintenance being spent on more retrofits into the system itself and how that looks into 2021, it's hard to tell. I mean, if you think about our business today in North America, it's 50% services, 50% equipment, of the 50% equipment, really only 20% or 30% of that is equipment, as we reported as Dodge put in place, the balance of that is retrofit. So my sense is the 70% of our business is going to be a tremendous amount of interest, I would say in indoor air quality first. And then I think as everybody knows, it's just not a matter of putting in a new system or retrofitting a system to have better indoor air quality characteristics, you don\u2019t have to maintain that system again that new better higher standards. So I think in the long run it really helps our model, it helps our business and clearly it creates a safer environment for occupants. Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, the only color I would add to that, Mike is, there is a lot of science behind indoor air quality and we've been at this for a long time. So we know how to do this, we've been selling this for years, it's just now we're getting a lot of attention, obviously, because of COVID. The other area that we're seeing, and I mentioned it earlier is in our digital connections. We're seeing a lot of customers now asking to be remotely connected, they understand the advantage of that now. So that's another area that they're making investments and we think that will continue into the second half. Joe Ritchie : That's helpful guys. My one quick follow-up here. You guys mentioned that on the resi side of your business in America, the distributor sells through was only down mid-single-digit. I'm just curious, like where do you think inventory levels are? Is there a possibility for restock to also kind of help that business? Mike Lamach : Well, we're actually joining in a great position to answer that because half of our business would be independent wholesalers and half of our business is, they're company owned wholesale distribution points. So we sell both, we see both the sell in and the sell through. But it's such an archaic time, one like, I've never remembered before where you saw in April and May the normal sort of selling that you would do to independent distribution really didn't happen as independent distributors made a decisions about what they\u2019ve thought the economy was going to hold for them and probably some preservation of working capital, some hesitation there. What they found out was the consumer was relatively resilient during that period of time. And probably, on average, found out they were holding say 25% less inventory as they entered June, than they needed to, of course, the sell through didn't changed, and we saw that on the company owned side of the equation. So that led to a record June in bookings for us, and it's led to a record July. I'll just give you one intra-quarter data point there, which is July, because it is such a quick book and turn business that it is relevant. So the numbers there were quite extraordinary, June bookings up say 40%, July booking say up 50%, all that pushed out from what would have been the normal seasonality of April and May. So the important thing I think for investors to look at right here is how healthy is the consumer, what's the sell through the actual take rate from the consumer and are they mixing up or mixing down? Interestingly, we're seeing a mix up and that's different. We're fortunate to that because part of what we're seeing in terms of our growth and our performance has been \u2013 we're now in the value segment of the market in this downturn. But ironically, we're seeing growth in both. We're seeing growth in for us at the entry level, at the value price points and we're seeing the premium systems also continue to have some solid strength. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Great color, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning, guys. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Scott. Dave Regnery : Good morning. Scott Davis : On the M&A side Mike, what's your appetite to potentially going outside of the cold chain? I mean, you could define your exposure to buildings pretty broadly and building controls and all kinds of things, maybe unrelated to the cold chain. Is that in your \u2013 is that a possibility or are you more likely to stay within your core? Mike Lamach : Well, it's interesting, Scott, because as you really look at the value chain inside the cold chain in the adjacencies that we would have still inside the cold chain, easily get to a $250 billion or $260 billion market. And even the example that Dave gave, which is the electrification of heat in Europe, right, we've never been in the boiler business, we've never been in the heating business per se in Europe. But now you create a solution where between cold air and hot water, you may be three or four times better than independent solutions, and we find ourselves now really in an adjacency, which is growing the business in Europe with ductless four pipe systems that allow us to participate in $1 billion market in Europe that we didn't participate in before. So one of the beautiful things about the work we've done in the transformation has all the strategy work to understand these adjacencies and see where the leverage is. So right now, everything we're looking at is fundamentally is how we see the adjacencies in the HVAC and refrigeration space. It doesn't mean that over the long run, we wouldn't look, but I think we've seen great opportunity right in our sweet spot, in our core competencies utilizing our channels, our engineering talent, our R&D, all the things that we're really good at. Scott Davis : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just as a follow-up, the indoor air quality stuff is dynamic, for sure. Is there any sense that perhaps government level standards could be established and maybe that's helpful for you guys like CDC or governments around the world that, I mean, may perhaps catalyze some of these changes? Because we all know without sometimes a little bit of a push sometimes building owners can be a little slow to move. Mike Lamach : Yes. Scott, there is some talk about that, obviously, we'd be a big part of any kind of standards that were derived, we've worked with ASHRAE, which is really the organization that kind of monitors this and has a lot of the testing associated with it. We've been asked by our customers, if you see in the presentation kind of that emblem there, they want their employees to know that in fact an expert has come in, has taken a look and have made changes to make the environment a safer place. So there is a chance that could become like the next lead. But right now, there is no quote standards around that as we speak. Dave Regnery : Yes. The only thing I'd add, Scott, building codes generally adopt, like in the case of the U.S. example ASHRAE standards. In fact, the ASHRAE standards were adopted throughout the world often in terms of codes and standards. So although the federal government is not mandating a particular standard, it's all built into the building codes that you would see in various States and municipalities around the list of country here. Scott Davis : Okay. All right, guys. Good luck. Congrats on keeping the wheels on and doing well. Mike Lamach : Thanks, Scott. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. Steve Tusa : Hey guys. Good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Steve. Dave Regnery : Hey, Steve. Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Can you just talk about what you think the market did for resi HVAC? I mean, I think you guys said you were down mid-singles for the quarter. Did you \u2013 do you think you gained market share? Mike Lamach : There is no doubt about the second part of your question. I think Dave, the market might've been down 11%, 12%, because of the weak April, May. Dave Regnery : Yes. And it really has to do with the week April, May, as Mike said. Steve Tusa : Right. Mike Lamach : June was extremely strong. Steve Tusa : And you define the market is just the AHRI kind of factory shipments. Mike Lamach : Yes. You can do that in hardy, I mean, you triangulate between the two for sure. Yes. Steve Tusa : Okay. When it comes to kind of the pipeline for commercial and these orders, I mean, you would think that this is a late cycle market and things will fade here over time. Are you expecting orders to kind of decelerate here or has that kind of bottomed as well? Mike Lamach : Well, for new put in place Dodge data, the 20%, 30% of the North American commercial business, you've really got to pull that apart \u2013 pick it apart by vertical market. And some vertical markets are obviously going to be growing and be more resilient, warehousing and data centers have been more resilient as an example versus retail office buildings or retail restaurants, that sort of thing. So you have to really pick that apart. But for the balance of the business, I think there's going to be a very active multiple year opportunity around going into the 70%, 80% of the business, right, both the service business and the retrofit business, the demand that we drive. Really looking at what the outcome needs to be around, some of these IAQ assessments and whether or not a customer can do everything at one time, thinking about a large school district or campus, or they want to prioritize certain things over time, you could really run out multi-year asset plans for customers around the facilities and what would work. So it's hard to know sort of, if you think about the percentage of the 20%, what would decline and compare that against what the opportunity is for my key basis, resulting retrofits and service opportunity within that, it's too early to tell Steve. But there's reason to hope for us that there's going to be a busy time for us relative to being able to drive demand through what we know how to do from an IAQ assessment. And then as Dave said and I followed onto Dave, all this is a tremendous tax on the energy efficiency of a building. So whether a building is occupied at 50% or 100%, in terms of running the systems, you're still running those systems at very high usage rate, and the intensity of course is very high with HVAC and lighting systems. So if you're going to take these IAQ ideas, which all our tax on energy used in the facility, we're going to have a second round or really a parallel round of when customers take an action to improve indoor air quality, looking for offsetting energy conservation measures to neutralize that, that I think is an opportunity as well. But it's too soon for us to tell kind of what really plays out. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks for all the detail. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Mike Lamach : Thanks, Andy. Dave Regnery : Hi, Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Mike, can you give us a little more color regarding the contributors to the better than gross margin, detrimental margin that you deliver in the quarter? Because it looks like you had several productivity projects that were effective, price versus cost was obviously very strong in the quarter. And then we know that you would \u2013 you said you would continue to deliver a detrimental in line with gross margin, maybe better than that in Q4. But given some improvement in your markets, why couldn't you deliver detrimental closer to Q2\u2019s performance? Mike Lamach : Yes, let me kick it off just with a general comment. I may have Chris for more specifics. But we wanted to establish sort of a set of guardrails, the guardrail being \u2013 we were going to run the leverage no worse than the gross margins of the company. And we're making a commitment for shareholders to know what to understand, would be one side of the guardrail. What we also said is we're going to play aggressive offense around running the business for the long run and trying to emerge a much stronger company through this. Now to the extent we can do both and invest in everything that we want to do, including the products and services that Dave mentioned, launched in the quarter, there is a possibility of doing better than the worst guardrail. So that's what happened in quarter two. But you have to realize these differences between a 20% leverage rate and a 30% leverage rate in the quarter like this past or last quarter, might have been $20 million or $30 million, right. Which in the grand scheme of things, if we choose to make an investment, which runs it to 30%, as an example, or we take another action, it's not as meaningful to us inside the quarter. But the one thing that investors should look at is the commitment that says, there's a guardrail that says, we're going to run the business with decrementals for the full year, add them inside our gross margins. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Yes. Mike, I would just add, all-in, it is a mix it's not clear today, how much is temporary versus permanent but we are really proud with the productivity, the tight spend control we had in the second quarter. With that, what is permanent are the structural cost takeouts that have happened that we've announced here and getting a full year ahead of taking out $100 million of stranded costs from the transaction. And maybe last, just to add there, as we think around the fourth quarter of this year, we may actually see deleverage be a little bit better than gross margins. You may recall we had a couple of one-timers in the fourth quarter of last year that we should comp better against here in the fourth quarter, Andy. But otherwise, Mike's laid out for you kind of the guardrails and happy where we landed in the second quarter. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that. And then, Mike, I just want to follow-up on some of the residential comments you made in the sense that, you did mention the 50% growth in residential bookings, if I'm not mistaken July, which is obviously [indiscernible] demand just for a month, obviously. But we know it got hotter, home sales have improved a bit. But did you see this boost as more of a fundamental change in the market, given the evolution of work from home? So maybe this change is more sustainable. I mean, we know we're not going to have that kind of growth every month, but just as there is something different about the market from what you can tell? Mike Lamach : Yes. That's why it was important this time to just give you the best information we can and to make it as simple as we could for any investor to understand was look at the sell-through, because it's just these aberrations we're seeing where distributors might've had 25% less than they would have normally needed coming into June. Let me see this 40% and 50% kind of growth in the order rates. It's a little bit of a catch up but I think that that sell-through is we want to look at here and look, I mean, best guess. And it's hard to know because we've only seen seven months of the year. You could see sell-through kind of down five downtime, Dave, I think that's probably five of the best case, time may not be the worst case we don\u2019t know we haven't seen the rest of the year yet. But the sell through is the important thing. The aberration was really in, you think about any independent wholesaler thinking about their own working capital, playing out their own recession playbook, worried about really less about a pandemic maybe and certainly about a pandemic, but more also about the long-term effect of a recession. There was a retrenchment and depending on how you place bets, as a distributor, you either did or didn't have enough stock to serve customers. So then, frankly, you get more into a panic situation in June and July. And it's a whipsaw, so I wouldn't pay attention to the 40 to the 50, I pay attention to the sell-through. And I think that that sell-through is probably going to be in that five, 10, Dave. Dave Regnery : Yes, I think it's around, probably closer to five. The other thing that's a little bit different too, is that and Mike mentioned it earlier is we're actually mixing up on SEER. So in past downturns, we tended to sell more lower SEER products. We're actually selling \u2013 we're actually mixing up and the high SEER products are very attractive to homeowners. And some of that obviously could be because a lot of people are working from home and they understand the advantage of those products. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks guys. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Dave Regnery : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Thanks. Good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Hi, Gautam, good morning. Chris Kuehn : Good morning, Gautam. Gautam Khanna : Good morning. To follow-up on Steve's question about Commercial HVAC bookings. As we move into the second half and into the first half of next year, I'm just wondering, it sounds like there's a lot of potential to work the installed base, as they kind of re-scope what they want. But does that also lead to a potential air pocket as these projects are re-scoped and you do the assessments. Is there just a natural lead time that's pretty extended to actually convert some of these folks into us to take on these new solutions that you're pinching? Dave Regnery : Yes. I'd tell you, Gautam, we've really seen the whole spectrum there, right. In some cases we have customers that need to do major work like they want to increase the amount of outside air they're bringing in, which actually means they need more cooling capacity. So that could be the longer lead side. And I would tell you that on the shorter lead side, we're seeing customers that really just need to fix some of their handling equipment and make sure the dampers are working properly and maybe increase a fan speed so that we can increase the filtration rate. So it's really all over the board and it's pretty early days here, right. I mean, so we can't, we're obviously tracking this very closely and we'll continue to do that. But we're probably a quarter or two away from being able to, actually give you more color around the size and what the whole opportunity will be. Gautam Khanna : And I know this is a stretch, but would you be willing to pontificate on whether you think Commercial HVAC sales could actually in aggregate, be up next year versus this year, based on that opportunity set? Mike Lamach : It\u2019s too early for us to be able to say that, Gautam. What I would tell you is our sales force, commercially, we think about it really as a \u2013 it's a 100% commission sales force, which is very unique out in the marketplace. They're not going anywhere. And if there's less things for them to do around new buildings and new construction, they're going to get after the billions of square feet that are out there where people need help. So I can tell you that we're going to have all the urgency to outperform the market going forward, that you'd expect. And for us, the most important thing is whatever the market is, we want to outperform the market. We want to grow EBITDA margins. And that's always been the case, the product growth teams has been the case around our product development cycles, it's been the case around why it's important for us to own and operate and service our commercial channel. Gautam Khanna : Thanks guys. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning guys. Dave Regnery : Hi Josh. Mike Lamach : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just to ask kind of the second half outlook question, maybe a little differently. Mike, how should we think about backlog consumption or backlog levels within the down 10 to 15? Is that kind of a backlog neutral type establishment or do you think that that's really just predicated on, hey, we have a lot to convert here, particularly in resi. And beyond that, we just don't know. Mike Lamach : Well, first of all, resi, don't even think about backlog, right. I mean, a typical quarter, we might pull two or three days worth of backlog across the quarter. What was different here is we pulled 10 times that across the quarter or more than that across the quarter. I'm sorry, a month a month. So that's an anomaly. On the commercial side, Chris, do you have a point of view on that? Chris Kuehn : Yes, I think it could be trending flat to slightly down on backlog by the end of the year, depending on the order rates that come in, what we're seeing. But I think it's a little bit too early to tell where we're going to land. I think the service offerings, Dave and Mike have talked about with indoor air quality, otherwise could also be a catalyst here for backlog. And for projects that I'd say at this point, it\u2019s too early to tell. Mike Lamach : We have a business \u2013 here, we call it turnkey. Turnkey for us, generally speaking, projects under $100,000, we're going in and doing retrofits and energy conservation projects and going forward, you're probably going to find a lot of indoor air quality projects going in that. So part of it is trying to understand how much increase in turnkey that we demand generate versus, what are we seeing in terms of traditional projects going through design, plan, spec, sourcing, construction and then ultimate delivery of product and services, hard to know. So this is \u2013 earlier point that I think Steve asked, just need more time here to see how this really plays out in terms of the kinds of opportunities and retrofits we see with IAQ. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Then just follow up on where we stand with. I guess, some of the initiatives proposed by Biden. I think talking about retrofitting 4 million buildings. I think you have a long enough memory as July on the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, which didn't seem like a needle mover at the time. But any perspective you would have on either lobbying to make sure HVAC is a big piece of that, or sales teams that are particularly geared to focus on it. Any, either lessons learned from history or perspective on what's been out there so far? Mike Lamach : We're a huge supporter of that because the payback on that it's not a handout, it's a payback. And so to the extent, federal and state buildings could be retrofitted. This always has been this enormous opportunity that I think that that sort of thing could really unlock for us. And certainly we're talking to the administration frequently around the opportunity there would be a strong supporter of that type of activity. And we're uniquely suited to be able to go address those challenges because, frankly, it's really doing two things. It's not just infrastructure, renewal, indoor air quality and energy savings. We're doing this stuff typically with reducing greenhouse gas emissions dramatically, if not completely, if they use our EcoWise portfolio. So it just checks so many boxes that are good for the country and for the world. And the paybacks on these things are very short. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Thanks Mike. Mike Lamach : Thanks Josh. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. I think there's been a lot of discussion on the buildings facing markets. So maybe turn the spotlight to transport refrigeration for a second. Your comments on the second half outlook, I guess were fairly downbeat, understandably. But just wondered if you could frame, sort of likely timing as you see it today for a recovery? And any kind of historical context this market tends to see quite rapid rebounds when they do occur? Is there any reason why you would think this time might be different? Dave Regnery : Yes, Julian, I'll start and Mike can add some color. But in North America, ACT right now is saying that 2021 will have a rebound of the \u2013 in the 20% range. IHS in Europe has got a little bit more conservative bounce back. So their models are saying that, we obviously have our own internal models that we track. There's been a lot of deferred buying, I would say, especially in the long haul space in North America. So we're hoping that ACT is correct. But I tell you, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there right now. And I would tell you that a lot of these trucking companies, they're very good business people and they're not going to make investments that they don't need, or they can't really see the return on. So we're cautiously optimistic on 2021. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And I'm just \u2013 my second question around capital deployment. Your sales outlook is a bit better than what it was for the year back in April, maybe there's a little bit more visibility in general today than three months ago. So just wanted to check in on that appetite to put the balance sheet to work in the next, call it six to 12 months and how you're thinking about the priority of acquisitions relative to buybacks at this point? Chris Kuehn : Yes, Julian, this is Chris. I'll start out with an answer. I mean, I think our strategy here around deployment has not changed. Right now, we're making sure we're funding the business with the investments that it needs, as Dave highlighted with the four product introductions we've had in the quarter. That's really important for us to make sure that's priority number one. I think we're keeping our optionality open for the second half, as it relates to share repurchases. As it relates to dividends, we're locked into dividends here through the third quarter. We'll have $375 million paid out approximately in dividends by the end of September. And after that, it's really looking to visibility into the future. The better visibility we have would give us a lot more confidence in deploying more at that point. So but right now the focus is on investment. Mike, anything? Mike Lamach : Yes, Julian. I think that our litmus test around share buyback versus M&A is just sort of the intrinsic value. But we think the share price, share value is and what we think the long range return is for the acquisition, the M&A. And so we've always been sort of agnostic and fair about looking at that. I mean, clearly all things being equal, we'd rather build and grow the company and have the opportunities that that presents itself. And so we are seeing a pipeline, it is active. We will do some things in the back half of the year. Frankly, COVID and travel is actually hurt things like due diligence, the amount of time we spend and the speed in which we could perhaps react and go see things. And so that's been a little bit more challenging for us, but I think we'll still be active this year with some M&A. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question today comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Obin : I appreciate you fitting me in. Just a question, AIA, I think recently just published the summary 2021 forecast for non-risk construction. And I think most of the forecasts that they have sort of indicate that I think buildings are going to be down next year. And I guess that's another way of asking question about market outlook for next year. But I think last year, I think Mike was highlighting the fact that, you guys have multi-year visibility on the cycle and just wondering what you sort of think about visibility on the cycle in light of this? And because it's late on the call, my second part is a lot more specific. What kind of visibility do you have on institutional market into the second half, specifically hospitals and education? Thank you. Mike Lamach : Yes, Andrew, remember that the AIA data is going to really look at 20% or 30% of our North American Commercial HVAC business and correlate to that. It's not going to correlate to the other 60%, 70%, which is going to be service and retrofit of the equipment base or even 70%, 80%, which is relative to the service plus the retrofit base. So we would intend to do better, I think, as a result of the service business to driving retrofits and these IAQ opportunities on that front. As it relates to sort of institutional activity and construction, it's a very late cycle activity. These projects take a long time to get started this typically funding, bond issuance, tax, taxes that funded these projects, they're often multi-year projects or multi-phase projects. And so they tend to last a long time and there's plenty of infrastructure required now. Dave, any more comments you might have on individual verticals or anything that might be helpful? Dave Regnery : I would just say that, this isn't normal time. Maybe last year we had a lot more visibility, but obviously things are changed right now. Like I told you earlier, it's pretty fuzzy right now as to what the verticals are. The good news is, is that we're very diverse in the verticals. So we're not over-weighted in any one vertical. And I think I said earlier, we are seeing strength in warehousing and strength is the right word, but they're stronger than other verticals and things like retail and office have slowed down considerably. Mike Lamach : Yes, I think market-wise, I'd worry more about the parts of the market that are much more consumer-sensitive like light commercial retail, big box, those sorts of things. We see more bankruptcies, more mall closures things like that, sort of the light unitary, the rooftop market, those respond much quicker to economic shock. Andrew Obin : I think what I was sort of referring to is I think lack of elective procedures really disrupted sort of finances at the hospitals. And I think sort of some of the dealers we talked to highlighted this uncertainty. So I was just wondering if any sign of hospital behavior returning to normal by year-end. Mike Lamach : Yes, look, it\u2019s put pressure on hospitals finances clearly without being able to do elective surgeries and whatnot. So that's something to keep an eye on. But one thing for certain is the healthcare infrastructure in the United States is not going to fail, right. If you think about any stimulus or any risk of that happening, I think that would be a place where you would see support coming in to help hospitals in that situation. So I'm not worried about the long-term or even the mid-term effective healthcare. And I think we've gotten through, hopefully we're getting through the worst of this non-elective surgery component, which drives revenues through the healthcare system. Andrew Obin : Really appreciate it. Thank you. Mike Lamach : Okay, thanks. Operator : And at this time, I will turn the call back to the presenters for any closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Hi, this is Zac Nagle. I just wanted to thank everybody for joining the call today. We really appreciate it. And as always Shane and I'll be available over the next coming days and today to take any questions or calls that you may have. So please reach out. Thanks. And we'll speak to you soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Before we move into the details of our third quarter results, I'd like to momentarily step back and provide broader perspective on the unprecedented level of change we've seen around the world, both in business and in our daily lives, and why this is particularly relevant for Trane Technologies. At present, we appear to be seeing an acceleration of COVID-19 cases in most parts of the world, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. As the weather turns colder and more activities and time is spent indoors, we're at a very critical phase in the course of this pandemic, and we can't let our guard down. Proper hygiene, distancing and the wearing of masks will all remain critical defensive actions in order to contain and eventually eliminate the spread of the virus. Overall, our best estimate is that there is 1.7 trillion square feet of residential and non-residential building space in the world. Over 400 billion square feet of this represents non-residential communal space. Importantly in developed economies, people spend an average of 90% of their day indoors, which reinforces the need for healthy indoor environments. Building owners, tenants and every occupant of an indoor space are certainly looking that the overall health of physical environment with a new sense of responsibility and concern. And there's no doubt all the contemplating and taking some action to renew or bring indoor spaces to better overall air quality standards. Systemic holistic actions to assess and improve the health and safety of indoor environments is paramount right now, and requires an industry wide response for support. Over the past quarter, we formed at center for healthy and efficient spaces modeled after the Center for Energy Efficiency and Sustainability that we formed over a decade ago, to convene internal and external experts to collaborate and deliver innovation, thought leadership, market education and communication and enhance the policies and standards required to meet the present and future challenges we're all facing. HVAC systems already drive 40% or more of a building's total electricity demand. While we know that many indoor air quality strategies and enhancements can have a negative impact of further increase in building electrical demand by 15% to 40%. This represents a significant challenge for energy efficiency, energy costs for owners. So as we help raise the overall indoor air quality of spaces, is critical that we find additional ways to mitigate the economic impact to our customers through the implementation of more efficient systems controls, and broad-based energy conservation measures that we can take on their behalf, which is critical to offsetting the unintended consequences of increasing overall carbon emissions through HVAC system's energy demand. At Trane Technologies, we want to be part of creating a better new normal. We will challenge the status quo to create a new normal where communities thrive, where quality is foundational and when the environment is protected for future generations. We're putting a stake in the ground that Trane Technologies will lead by example, by setting a stork and ambitious commitments and taking action to change our company, our industry and the world. Our Gigaton Challenge committed to reducing our customers' carbon emissions by 1 gigaton or 1 billion metric tons by the year 2030. To give you an idea of size and scale, that's equivalent to about 2% of the world's annual emissions. That's just our company alone, because other companies join us, we can bend the curve on global warming. We're also committed to creating opportunity for all with the goal to achieve gender parity and leadership by 2030, and racial and ethnic diversity that is reflective of our communities. Our transformation plan for Trane Technologies is another example of how we're creating a new better normal for our team, customers and shareholders executing against the new blueprint that culminated in May, after approximately one year of analysis and planning, Setting needs and other bold plans in action, our talented team around the world has exhibited all the commitment and passion for change that has marked our last decade. Our goal is simple, to create a new normal, where opportunities accessible for all healthy food, water and medicines are moved to people who need them, our emissions turned down and blue skies turned up. Our business sits right at the intersection of making those things happen. With our unique positioning as a focused climate innovator, transformed and fit for purpose, we can tackle these pressing and complex challenges and drive differentiated returns for shareholders. Moving to Slide 4, as everyone listening to this call today can attest. The global COVID 19 pandemic continues to present ongoing challenges to virtually every aspect of our daily lives. As much progress is we've made the questions were all contemplating months ago regarding the depth and duration of the downturn, and the speed and shape of the recovery still very much with us. While there are several promising vaccines in process timing, availability, and mass distribution capabilities that might radically change the trajectory of the pandemic remain open questions. Despite these ongoing challenges, our teams remain focused and agile, effectively navigating and evolving landscape to meet the needs of our customers go to deliver strong financial results for our shareholders in the third quarter. We outperformed our end markets broadly, delivering strong bookings growth, positive revenue growth, robust margin expansion, strong EPS growth, and exceptional free cash flow. Continued strong performance gives us confidence to once again raise our outlook for 2020 revenues and leverage, and along with that raising our outlook for operating income and EBITDA as well. But only do we expect our current outlook for 2020 revenues of down roughly 6% to significantly outperform a prior outlook of down 10% and 15%, we also expect to see some improvement in the fourth quarter as well. Assuming the current course and speed of the global economic recovery, we expect the fourth quarter revenues to be down just 5% despite tough comps for North American HVAC business and continued weakness in global transport markets. Additionally, we have improved outlook for deleverage in quarter four in 2020 to better than gross margin levels based on expectations for continued strong execution. Our prior outlook was for gross margin to deleverage the low 30% range for 2020. We continue to take aggressive actions to emerge stronger and to thrive as business conditions improve and new opportunities develop. We maintain high levels of business reinvestment and innovation and growth programs throughout the third quarter, and expect to further accelerate our investments in the fourth quarter. We have a strong slate high ROI projects and our core business as well as opportunities to accelerate investments in new IAQ and cold chain storage solutions. We set a course to accelerate our stranded cost and other fixed costs reduction initiatives in the first half of the year in order to deliver more bottom line savings both 2020 and 2021 and we are on track to deliver these savings. We remain in a very strong financial balance sheet and liquidity position. We've delivered strong free cash flow in 2020. You will probably pause elements of our balanced capital allocation strategy through the third quarter in favor of capital preservation and optionality. Exiting the third quarter based on strong performance and a current course speed of the global economic recovery will well positioned to bring all elements of a balanced capital allocation strategy back into play at this time. Our core strategy remains unchanged. Secular megatrends of energy efficiency and sustainability are becoming more pressing every day. And these trends are now elevated with the increasing need to ensure the health and safety of the environments we work and live in. We excel at addressing these megatrends and challenging what is possible for a sustainable world, redefining a higher standard for what the world considers normal. This passion powers us forward to deliver top tier financial performance and differentiated returns for our shareholders. Now I like to turn the call over to Dave to discuss our bookings and revenue performance in the quarter. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Mike. Please go to Slide 5. Third quarter impacts of the global pandemic drove further contraction from 2019 levels in the majority of our key end markets. Despite these headwinds, our global teams remain focused and agile and delivered positive revenue and 7% bookings growth in the quarter. In the Americas, the economy is slowly progressing forward, but the situation remains tenuous. Our America segment delivered growth in both bookings and revenue in the third quarter, up 8% in bookings and 2% in revenues. In the Americas, our commercial HVAC business has remained resilient through 2020 with Q3 bookings down low-single digits and revenue remaining flat with prior year. Services continue to outperform equipment, but remain challenged by pandemic specific downturn impacts primarily related to low building occupancy rates and other building closures related to ongoing health and safety concerns. Our teams have been effective and efficient at adapting to the changing landscape and capturing opportunities to outgrow market conditions in areas such as indoor air quality assessments and services. Strong performance in our residential HVAC business enabled us to take advantage of strong growth in both replacement and new construction markets in the third quarter. Residential bookings are up more than 30% and revenues are up high-teens in the quarter. Backlog remains at record levels entering Q4. Our transport refrigeration business outperformed the overall markets which were down more than 30% in the quarter. Revenues were down over 20%, bookings were positive in the quarter up low-single digits. Turning to EMEA, the overall EMEA market continues to be challenged but teams continue to execute well. EMEA delivered positive bookings growth of 6% in the quarter with growth In both commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration. Revenues again outgrew underlying market conditions down 6% overall. Commercial HVAC bookings were up high-single digits, while revenues were down mid-single digits. Services outperformed equipment, but are still constrained by pandemic specific downturn impacts noted earlier. EMEA transport bookings were positive in the quarter, up low-single digits. Revenues were down high single digits, outperforming the broader transport markets, which were down more than 20%. Asia-Pacific results continue to be mixed, with overall bookings down 5% and revenues down 2%. China continues to show signs of relatively steady improvement. Having made the most progress against the pandemic, growth in China was more than offset by declines in the rest of Asia, where a number of countries have yet to turn the tide on the pandemic and begin on the path of recovery. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris to discuss the results of our quarter in more detail. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide 6. Dave, provided a good overview of our revenues on the prior slide, so I'll focus my comments on margins. Adjusted EBITDA margins are strong, up 80 basis points with operating leverage better than gross margin rates. We delivered strong margin expansion through focused execution of a recession playbook to adapt to evolving market conditions. Productivity was very strong across the board in the quarter, reflecting strong execution and cost containment, right size for the revenue declines we expected to see. Top-line execution exceeded our expectations heading into the quarter, which benefited margins given tight cost controls in each segment. Price costs remain positive in the quarter. While mix remained a significant headwind given steep declines in transfer revenues in both the Americas and EMEA. We also maintained high levels of business reinvestment and employee safety measures, innovation and technology. Please turn to Slide 7. Turning to the regional segments, I'll once again focus my comments on margins as Dave provided a good overview of revenues earlier. In the Americas region, strong residential revenues, productivity, cost containment and price more than offset headwinds from transport mix driving solid margin expansion. Similarly, the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions delivered strong productivity and cost containment to improve margins versus 2019. Please turn to Slide 8, we've consistently been able to raise our outlook for revenues and leverage from our initial scenario view at the outset of the pandemic, and we are raising it once again heading into the fourth quarter of 2020. Assuming current course and speed of the global economic recovery, we now expect 2020 revenues to come in down approximately 6% with better than gross margin deleverage. This compares favorably to our prior outlook for 2020 revenues to be down 10% to 15%. We expect Q4 revenues to be down approximately 5%, with better than gross margin deleverage. We continue to operate from a position of strength and intend to continue to play aggressive offense through the downturn in order to emerge an even stronger company post-pandemic. In terms of our outlook for Q4, we wanted to provide some additional items that may help with your modeling. We operate a CapEx light business model of 1% to 2% of revenues and we are likely investing on the lower end of that range for 2020. We expect free cash flow to remain strong and equal to or greater than 125% of adjusted net earnings for 2020. Quarterly interest expense is expected to be consistent at $62 million in the fourth quarter. Our tax rate remains in the 19% to 20% range for 2020. And lastly, our share count is expected to be approximately 243 million shares for 2020. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave to provide our market outlook. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number nine. As we've highlighted, North America commercial HVAC has significantly outperformed the broader markets through the third quarter through strong focus, agility and execution. We're seeing high levels of interest in and strong conversion for comprehensive indoor air quality assessments and momentum in this space continues to build. The universe of opportunity is huge based on billions of installed square footage that could ultimately be evaluated and addressed. But the opportunity is still early stages. For Q4, we expect our North America commercial HVAC business to be down between 5% and 10% primarily driven by the extremely tough comps the business faces. Q4 2019 revenues were up nearly 20%, which is essentially equivalent to two years of 10% growth all in one year. Tough comps aside, our North American commercial HVAC business remains healthy and resilient and we expect backlog to be roughly flat in 2020 versus the end of 2019, despite significant declines in the non-residential markets in 2020. Turning to residential, we saw a record bookings and revenue in third quarter, which puts us in a strong backlog position entering the fourth quarter. Residential is still a book and turn business, and it's unclear how November or December will shake out at this point. So too early to call Q4 at this stage. Turning to North America transport, we're seeing some positive trends and freight rates and order rates and we're aligned with act that the overall transport market growth rates are likely to improve sequentially from Q3 to Q4. Act has calling for the market to be down roughly 20% in Q4, so we're expecting continued headwinds for our North America transport business in the quarter. Turning to EMEA, where recovery continues to be relatively soft and country dependent. Some countries are bracing for another round of restaurants and other venue lockdowns and border closures. It's too early to call the recovery broadly in Europe, and we'd expect both commercial HVAC and transport markets to be challenging in Q4. Transport markets will be especially challenging, as the market outlook calls for a 25% decline in the fourth quarter, which will only be amplified by border and venue closures should they occur in parts of Europe. Turning to Asia, we continue to be encouraged by the recovery in China, which we expect to have solid growth in Q4. However, we expect to see similar results to the third quarter in the rest of Asia, in which revenue declines more than offset growth in China. Please turn to Slide number 10. At the time we announced the industrial RMT transaction, we quickly mobilized the transformation office to focus on streamlining our organization to remove $100 million of stranded cost from the business by 2021. As Mike discussed earlier, we are on track to achieve $100 million in 2020 and $140 million in 2021. As we discussed, we expect onetime expenses of approximately $100 million and $150 million to eliminate the stranded and other fixed costs. We have spent approximately $91 million year-to-date with $15 million in Q3. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris to discuss our balanced capital allocation strategy. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please go to Slide number 11. As Mike mentioned earlier, we paused on elements of our balanced capital allocation strategy through the third quarter in favor of capital preservation and optionality. Exiting the third quarter based on our strong free cash flow generation and our current outlook. We're in a strong position to bring all elements of our balanced capital allocation strategy back into play. Our balanced capital allocation strategy is focused on consistently deploying excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. Despite economic conditions, we continue to strengthen our core business with healthy levels of business investments, and high ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects, which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership and margin expansion. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We have a longstanding commitment to reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth overtime. We continue to pursue strategic M&A that further improves the long-term shareholder returns. And we continue to see value in share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. All in, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash overtime. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave and Mike to cover key investor topics of interest and to close at the summary of key points. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please go to Slide number 13. Indoor air quality is generating tremendous interest in the market and our pipeline for services and system enhancements is growing daily. Fundamentally, our customers are turning to us for our unmatched expertise, direct service channel, and remote monitoring services to improve the safety of their buildings and build the confidence of their building occupants. We offer a holistic, layered, fully customized approach, which balances key contributors to indoor air quality with energy intensity. At this stage, we're seeing solid activity for more modest sized projects, aimed at immediately addressing the most pressing challenges for reopening buildings. As Mike highlighted at the outset, we believe indoor air quality represents a long-term secular tailwind for Trane Technologies, as businesses and consumers alike have come to think differently about the health and safety of the air they breathe everywhere. With an eye on the longer term, we launched our Center for Healthy and Efficient Spaces during the quarter. The center is focused on driving long-term strategy and innovation within our business and influencing the establishment of codes and adoption of standards in the built environment. Please go to Slide number 14. Another topic we know is on the minds of investors revolves around transport markets in 2020 and 2021. For 2020, the North American market is expected to be down about 35% and our numbers clearly show outperforming the markets. The same applies for EMEA, where the markets are expected to be down roughly 25% for 2020. We're on pace to outperform in EMEA as well. Turning to 2021, we are positive on the markets and consistent with the market outlooks from ACT and IHS which calls for transport markets to be up approximately 41% in North America and 11% in EMEA. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mike for closing remarks. Mike? Mike Lamach : Please go to Slide 15. We've mentioned that we intend to hold an investor event in December, and we firmed up what that event will be. We're looking at the morning of December 14, and we hope all of you can join us, it should be a great event. While the pandemic continues to present unprecedented challenges to visibility of the markets, we evolve of the near to medium term, rather than conduct a traditional Investor Day with three year top-line and bottom line targets we believe it will be more concrete and constructed to talk about the things we control, which are the transformational activities associated with the new Trane Technologies that we're working on for the past year. We're going to take a couple of hours in the morning of the 14th to focus on the self-help story with Trane Technology supports continued margin expansion and growth across our business that is not dependent on our current end markets perform. We've touched on some of these we've been working on and this will be a deeper dive in order to provide investors that continued confidence in our margin expansion and innovation story. This will be a virtual event given the current environment. We'll follow up with additional details on the event, but please be sure to save the date. Please go to Slide 16. I believe it was Peter Drucker who said that culture eats strategy for breakfast, and we couldn't agree more with that idea. The topic of what happens or changes when organizations culture has been top of mind for many these days and certainly for me. As we went through the very difficult work of the industrial separation and formation of the Reverse Morris Trust, we blueprinted the new Trane Technologies and work through and weather the impact of the pandemic to this point, we've had plenty on our plate as a newly created Trane Technologies. I'm proud to say that through all of this, the pride, energy and optimism that is emblematic of our culture has only gotten stronger. We've recently received feedback from 90% of our associates globally and nearly 35,000 people in this year's engagement survey, with over 60,000 verbatim comments provided. The results were overwhelming. Our engagement index achieved top quartile again of all companies and improve year-over-year. With pride in our company energy for what we do in the world, and optimism about Trane Technologies future at the core of the feedback received. I'm proud of our people, our entire team and our shared inspiration that one company can change an industry and our industry can change the world. As I said at the outset of the call, energy efficiency and sustainability megatrends are only growing stronger as time passes. And fundamentally, we excel with these global megatrends and sustainability intersect with our innovation and capabilities, that strives high demand for our products and services. The increased focus on the health and safety of spaces and our holistic approach to helping our customers navigate solutions to improve indoor air quality is another opportunity for Trane Technologies to make a difference in the world. We've been investing heavily for years to build franchise brands and to advance our leadership market positions to enable consistent profitable growth and we intend to presser advantage during this downturn, to leverage a strong financial and competitive positioning and to invest heavily in the future of Trane Technologies. Our message to our investors is unambiguous. We're stepping up to the challenges of today and tomorrow, but we will never stand still and we're certainly not going to slow down. Our results in the marketplace or the ultimate parameter. We're not only focused on relentless investments in innovation and growth, investments and blueprinting and transforming into a leaner fit for purpose pure play company through the elimination of stranded costs, and the execution of transformation initiatives that will fundamentally improve the margin profile of the company over the long-term. Lastly, we remain committed to dynamic and balanced deployment of capital, and we have a strong track record of delivering strong free cash flow, deploying excess cash to deliver top tier shareholder returns over the years. And with that, Chris, Dave, and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just the first question around the commercial HVAC environment in the Americas. Because I suppose as you point out, the end market indicators, things like project starts down or weak, your own backlog, though you think is stable into year-end? So, when I think about that, would you think that the negative impact of those end market indicators and starts - you're already moving past the worst of that or do you think that will hit your backlog early mid next year? Or alternatively, there's just no real trend to call out because of COVID, you're just taking kind of each quarter as it comes and the markets just too choppy to corner a trend line? Mike Lamach : Yeah, Julian. It's probably a little bit too early to understand the trend line there. But remember that probably 15% to 20% of our business is really affected by Dodge data - that put in place data that you read. And a lot more of that is predicated on how we're doing with creating demand around retrofits and indoor air quality. So, I do think you're correct, I do think we exit the year relatively flat in terms of our backlog. And based on everything that we've been through this past year, that's somewhat of an achievement to end with the flat backlog. So, I think with the current course and speed going into '21, we've got enough strength enough health in many markets to have a decent year in '21 around growth. Julian Mitchell : Thanks. And then maybe just a quick follow up question around the residential market. Any perspectives on what the total market you think is doing this year? And the extent to which you think that sets a high or normal or low bar for next year? And any updates on your thoughts on that replacement cycle in the U.S. resi? Chris Kuehn : Well, it's strange here, because demand was really shoved around - pushed around. I think everyone went into a recession playbook and the pandemic playbook is a bit different as people generally felt so good about the jobs and investing in indoor air quality at home. And so you saw drive toward not only replacing systems, but even mix for us that went up versus down through that. So, I don't think that that continues indefinitely. I think it begins to normalize probably in quarter four, certainly in quarter one. The unique thing is we're moving in from what was really an extended peak season, into really the build that we would normally do in the fourth quarter and beginning of the first quarter for the traditional peak season that we would see, the cooling season as well next year in '21. So, I think the best way to look at that is to look at the 2020 is a bit of an anomaly. And I think we will move into a more normalized '21. Everything that we're seeing around the setup for '21 would be that we see a little bit of growth in '21. But again, it's all predicated on the current course and speed of the economy and certainly how people feel about employment and overall consumer confidence as we get further into - be into '20 and into early '21. Of course that business is really a book in turn business. And we were looking to turn everything you could build in the fourth quarter. Teams done an outstanding job about being able to meet demand that we didn't forecast and get that turned into revenue and nice margin expansion for the quarter. So, I want to compliment the execution there, but again, I think it normalizes. Julian Mitchell : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Hello everyone. Chris Kuehn : Hi, Jeff. How are you doing? Jeff Sprague : Doing great. Thanks. Just back on the commercial question. The growth that you're seeing in services, I think you said low-single digit in the quarter. Is it your view that's a kind of a pretty steady run-rate for the situation that we're in or with some catch up from site access in Q2? Dave Regnery : Jeff, this is Dave, I'll start and Mike and Chris can add on. But yeah, we're very happy with our service businesses really globally. They've outperformed the equipment, despite the pandemic. And there's a lot of office buildings that are still - in the occupied, there's a lot of buildings that are not occupied at all with closures. We have schools that, various degrees of when students are actually coming back. So, despite all of that, our service business is still growing and it's outperforming our equipment business. Chris Kuehn : I'd say based on availability [ph], it's still a headwind, IAQ certainly a tailwind. But net net that I think is a positive setup for the service business. And I would say the service business was a great antidote to a recession. Of course, pandemic is different in that if access to buildings is denied, it's tough to grow a service business, but we're very busy on the IAQ front. And as buildings continue to open, there will actually be some deferred service deferred maintenance that I would expect we'd see there as well. Jeff Sprague : And then I'm wondering on the IAQ, thanks for the additional framing of maybe the square footage could be a target. So, it sounds like it's still early days as you know, but I think Dave, you mentioned you're starting to book some midsized projects. Is there anything we can kind of glean there, like what that means midsized project would increase your service opportunity and building XYZ by some percentage? And just some kind of rough framework to kind of get ahead around the dollar opportunity here? Dave Regnery : Yeah, I mean, I would tell you that we continue to see strong customer demand and momentum in indoor air quality number one. And just take a step back, when we do an assessment, Jeff, it's not a check the box. So, these assessments take hundreds of hours to complete. And we take a very holistic approach when we look at the building. So, we it's not just changing out one item within a system, it really has to be a systems approach, otherwise, you can make some very bad decisions for the end customer. Our audits fall past ways, best practices, we ensure the building equipment is operating, the way it was designed. You then start looking at opportunities to improve the indoor air quality, whether that be on the filtration side, whether that be on the fresher exchange side. We also look at sensors to prove the humidity levels, temperature occupancy, that's all part of what we would do for our customers. What we do is we lay out for our customers a very layered approach. So we'll tell the customer what we will do on day one to get the building operating the best they can with the current assets in place. And then we'll give them a roadmap for the future. And that roadmap could be if they wanted to increase the fresh air exchanges to a greater degree, they may need additional cooling capacity. It could be, as Mike alluded to earlier on the energy side, where there's energy projects that could actually reduce the tax that we put on the building to bring the indoor air quality up. When we say modest projects, we're talking about what we call day one projects. And that is, let's get your building as healthy as we can get it with your current set of assets today. And then we'll give you that roadmap for the future. Chris Kuehn : That's why I think it's a long-term play. Because that would need be wanting to do something right now. And then ultimately if the building wasn't designed that do what it needs to do, or your system limitations of what those standards should be for the building, they have changed use over some period of time and never was adapted. Those are all necessary investments that need to be made. One of the things I just offer for this because if on the phone here, just some advice on this. The opposite of a holistic approach that sort of a point solution and one of the point solutions that we're seeing that's a little bit problematic is a lot of people have gotten just moved to really dense filter medium. And what's happening there is you're not getting often enough airflow out of spaces. And as you do that, you're actually making the situation worse at the ends of duct runs and buildings. And so you're not getting the air changes per hour and in fact the systems and fans may not have the capacity to support that, then we're going back in, at that point and putting some math modeling around once the maximum filter media you could change. How do we impact that by maybe maximizing actual or changes? How do we get humidity for an aerosol contaminant? So it's a little bit heavier, falls faster? What can we use to kill it that wouldn't create environmental problems for occupants? And those are all of the things that holistically we try to put together, as well as the back end energy conservation measures to mitigate the effect of all those. Jeff Sprague : Great, thanks for that color. Best of luck. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, good morning all. Chris Kuehn : Hey Josh, good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Mike, with some of these upgrades that are coming through especially the holistic stuff around IAQ. I appreciate kind of the - the global square footage numbers that you throw out there and certainly the size and energy efficiency opportunity on the install base is pretty large. I think in the past, you've talked about in the applied world, kind of that dollar of equipment and $5 of parts and services through the lifespan. Any way to dimensionalize what these upgrades are or worse in the context of that dollar? Is it $0.10, is it $0.90, like just maybe give us a sense for how much these things cost relative to just pull off purchasing a new system? Mike Lamach : Yeah, for $1 spent in an applied system, it's a 30-year life cycle, we'd see a range of 8 to 12 times that, in terms of the service and retrofit potential around that. So that that's probably what you're referring to there, Josh. And I think that's true. I think the urgency probably on the front end to do something in terms of the day explained plan and that plan has to be consistent with someone's overall financial capacity to execute the plan. We've got to work with customers to be able to do that. So Dave said, day one or the mitigating things we can do, day two and beyond, what are the things that would need to - have to happen in the system some to put them at a standard or a best in class. But I think also too, as people look at buildings, particularly tenants and landlords trying to lease buildings. There's going to be some tendency to be inquiring about this a lot, from understanding to what degree have you made modifications, or what does a building need to do to perform at a standard that should be best and healthy for occupants. And so that's going to play into this as well. So, I think we'll be busy doing some asset planning for customers and longer term. I think that they probably accelerate some of the retrofits. It will also have the impact of things that are in design and things that are not yet in design, but will be built in the future, probably built to either standard. Not just the installed modeled standard, but the maintenance standards as well. Because it's really critical, as you know that energy can drop as example, from model to actual it could drop 30% in a matter of just a couple of years through customers overriding system points. This is analogous to that. You can do all this great work around filters and outdoor air exchanges and dampers and linkages. But if you're not maintaining that stuff, you default back to where you were. So maintenance will be improved going forward, I think, as well as the ability to monitor the stuff remotely, because there's just so much out there to look at, you're going to have to do this digitally and look for anomalies in the systems. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. It's helpful. And just pivoting quickly over to the transport side of the house. Any sense for what the opportunity could look like or any inquiries customers are making about vaccine distribution and transportation there and the capacity that might be needed to support that? Dave Regnery : Josh, this is Dave, I'll take that. And just take a step back, Thermo King business, we have a complete line of products and services that is for the whole coal chain for distribution, whether that's air, truck, trailer, marine, rail, last mile, refrigerated, containers. There are several vaccines I'm sure everyone's aware that are being worked. Some are in Phase 3 trials right now. It's unclear as to which will be first to market. And depending on the vaccine they have different temperature requirements for distribution. So, it ranges from a deep freeze, which could be as cold as minus 80 C to frozen, which rewinds 10 C to just like a pharmaceutical, which would be like 2 C. The markets have sufficient capacity for trailer over the land where we see opportunities is really in three spaces. One is an air, and we've been in the air business for four decades, we have all the approved certifications, whether it's FAA or ESA, which is the equivalent in Europe. We also see some opportunities in last mile. And we see a big opportunity in deep freeze cold storage. And we just have a new product that we introduced there a few months ago, this is a product that in a typical hospital, your deep freeze capability is really about the size of your refrigerator at home. And our solution there is about 60 times the volume that a deep freezer you'd find in a hospital could hold. So, that's going to be a big opportunity for Thermo King. Who we're talking to, we're talking to pharma companies, distribution companies, 3PL, government healthcare providers, we're talking to everyone? And we're going to be ready with the distribution solution storage solution, when that time comes. And hopefully, it's soon when we start distributing vaccines. Mike Lamach : And if I add, the affordable solution that's got the 60x capacity of the current market capability. It's still a mobile unit, when you pair that with our rental and logistics capability through our rental businesses, we've got the opportunity to move things around there, as they needed. I really proud of the work the team did here to take every pharma manufacturing and vaccine and work with them specifically around the requirements and exactly how and eventually vaccines can be packed and distributed. But also understanding exactly what their supply chain looks like and where the break points could be in the cold chain so that we can map out the capacities for every pharma company going through every distribution model, all the way through to a CVS or at Walmart, for example, here in the U.S. about how people will eventually be inoculated. So, in doing that, it's allowed us to be able to look at constraints, look at capacities and make sure that we're selling product that people would actually need it as opposed to just selling product into capacities that may not be required, that would be a real mess if that happening. We're being very conscientious about sort of observing that capacity to put it into the best place. Josh Pokrzywinski : Appreciate it. Thanks, Mike. Thanks Dave. Operator : The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Good morning. We're a long way from the dry ship R22 changes if you remember those days, Mike. Mike Lamach : Sorry, I'm not [ph] Steve. Steve Tusa : You don't have to it's been nothing but up into the right congrats on continued execution share gain, et cetera. On - just thinking about all this kind of air quality stuff and the opportunity. I mean, what needs to come together from your perspective as a catalyst to kind of unlock some of this? I mean, I think ASHRAE is very busy trying to kind of figure out standards. And you've got obviously the messaging around the election around green new deals and ESG. I mean, how fragmented is this? Right now, it sounds very fragmented, what kind of brings it all together and kind of catalyzes customers, do you think to get kind of off the sidelines? Mike Lamach : I think it just comes down to first, looking at the behavioral science behind all this. And what we as consumers and building occupants, and building owners and tenants think about space going forward. And so it's not going to require somebody to kind of convene that into, on demand or coder standard. Although I think what will happen is, initially, particularly in developed economies, there will be immediate look back to looking at buildings and whether or not they're operating at standards, and then what would you do to mitigate that? I think it creates a step up where codes don't exist or don't exist to the stringent level of a standard, where those become implemented much more quickly than perhaps would have happened. But particularly for us, when you think about, our non-residential opportunity which is the bulk of our global business we're really only in the res business, if you will in the U.S. and Canada. If you think about that, these are sophisticated building owners applied maybe more institutional critical systems, they get it. They get it immediately and they know to open a factory, a hospital, university, a research center. They're going to - you have to be at least at whatever the best standard is. So I don't think anything actually has to happen. Of course, anything that could happen, that would create more focus on driving codes and implementing them faster would be additive to that. Steve Tusa : So I mean, you think that even without that, that there's enough will to kind of fund some of these big investments that would move beyond just something like the ancillary at the margin for your business? Mike Lamach : Yes, if you think about even just, again our non-res business, being in the 10s of billions of square feet that we've got an installed base, that's a great starting point. And in situations like this, where you can't get to everybody immediately right away that's why honestly, it has to get an industry response solving for 1.7 trillion square feet of space. You're going to go to the people that get it first, and it wants to do something about it. And so, we're going to be selective about who we're talking to and how long we're talking to them before somebody does something. It's a function of making sure that you disqualify opportunity as readily should qualify opportunities, when you've got that much opportunity in front of you. So we're going to spend our time prioritizing with the people that want to act on it quickly and making sure that we're going to where the action will be taken, which of course, is going to drive outcomes for health, and it's going to drive revenues for us. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks for the color. Congrats again. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Hello. Mike Lamach : Hey, Scott. Scott Davis : Good morning. I am going to collect a question this quarter. But when you think about the resi side, do you guys have any visibility into how people are financing units, whether they --once upon a time, I know, home equity loans were real popular, and then there were specialty finance companies and then it was back to credit cards. I'm just kind of curious to see what - how people are paying for things now? Have you seen any change or have visibility in that far down in the channel? Mike Lamach : Yes, I guess I started with U.S. savings rates quadruple, but I think in quarter two and the first part of quarter three we were sitting around 20%versus the 4% or 5% savings rate. And people obviously aren't going out and taking vacations and doing the things they were doing. So I think there is actually more capacity. And I also think that home values have increased, the people feel that they're pretty solid footing, at least at this point around home values. So, I think the between savings rate home equity lines that may be open, that's the primary that we're seeing there. We're not hearing anything, specifically about higher take rate around financing. Scott Davis : Okay, thanks. That makes sense. I figured that was answered, but you never know it's a strange, time. And then the other question I have for you guys, it's just visibility on non-res in China and kind of looking out there. I mean, what are your local guys saying as far as project activity and things and general outlook? Dave Regnery : Yes. Scott, this is Dave, I'll take that. We're pretty happy with the growth rates that we're seeing right now in China, in our business, I think a lot of that comes back to the investments that we made four years ago, when we developed the direct sales force there. If you remember those days, we had - we literally went out and trained 300-400 engineers to have a direct sales force, actually go talk to engineers and architects and to help become the basis of design. So with that as a backdrop, what we're seeing strength in China is in data centers, electronics, pharma and healthcare. And those are areas that we have a lot of activity and we have weakness obviously, as well. Some of those spots would be office and retail. But overall, the team, and you heard Chris say in the beginning, our team and in China has done just an excellent job and we're really proud of their accomplishments. Scott Davis : Okay, thank you guys. Good luck. Dave Regnery : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : So, my first question guys is this, on just the resiliency of your service business in North America. I'd be curious as you're thinking about 2021, whether it's - how you kind of contracted the business? How you expect that to look like in '21, particularly at a time now, obviously, where occupancy rates are a lot lower and commercial buildings. I'm just wondering if there's any headwind to potentially think through as we head into next year. Mike Lamach : Yeah. I mean it's probably helps to think about this a little bit of a bell curve, as it relates to people that are out of business, or will be out of business and are coming back in business. And there's going to be some space, obviously, some retail space as an example that restaurants that's going to be the question. You get people are absolutely coming back, and investing a warehouse in data centers or other businesses that relate to that. But the folks in the middle that are going to come back, it's a matter of sort of time and maybe density for how they pack and organize occupants and buildings. They're going to use the opportunity preopening to mitigate as much as they can. I mean they have to mitigate the space in some way before people return to the office. And so we're sitting in North Carolina today, and we're communicating to our population just as recently as last week about our intentions. And we don't see people coming back into the office here, unless they need to do their work or they can and we put these protocols in place, but we're not expecting people to come back in at least until the early part of next year. And even that's up for grabs, as relates to what the science will tell us and case rates look like in the local community. But having said that, we've gone through and taking enormous investment to get our space, up beyond a standard to have people feel comfortable coming back. And I think that you're saying the bulk of the bell curve in companies and landlords and tenants that are requiring some mitigation to take place now. And so again, between not being able to get the subspaces, and then the tailwind around providing some mitigating activity for people who are going to be opening, as well as providing services for the people that are open. There's enough for us to do there, and I think see some growth and services. Joe Ritchie : That's helpful, Mike. And maybe just my one follow on question. Focusing on U.S. resi HVAC for just a second. And clearly the bookings growth has been really good. You guys seemingly are taking some share there. I guess my question is, as we kind of switch into the cooler months with the furnace season, are there any - I guess - or do you have any supply constraints and delivering on the type of bookings growth that you're experiencing? And then are there any issues to maybe think through, as you kind of switch over into furnace season? Dave Regnery : Yes, I'll take that. This is Dave. We're not seeing any constraints in our supply. I think, if you go back to the end of March, we reconfigured all of our factories and put the right safety protocols in place. We also have a team that was working with our suppliers to ensure that they were able to provide us components, that still is all in place. And right now, we have no constraints in front of us. Mike Lamach : Yes, I just would add that just absolutely heroic efforts by our residential team, our manufacturing, and supply chain teams, to make sure that we were able to respond to this demand. Because again, this was not predicted, we didn't see these volumes coming in a typical recession playbook. And this is a different set of viewing behaviors happening here around how people thinking about in their space at home. And the ability to respond to that was really a lot of hard work by some great people out in the organization getting it done. Joe Ritchie : Good to hear. Thank you all. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Dave Regnery : Hi, Andy. Thank you. Andy Kaplowitz : Getting the increased demand that you talked about for IAQ and service in the commercial side, as well as the strength you continue to see in residential. While I know, you talked about expecting more normalized here in '21 in residential? Are inventory is generally across the respective channels still relatively low? Does that give you more confidence in the relative end markets as you go into Q4 and into 2021? Mike Lamach : Inventory levels coming out of Q2, we're about half of what they needed to about. So if you think about three months, it's kind of more typical. It might have been sitting at six weeks and that drove incredible demand that we saw in June, July, August and really continued. I would say, as an industry, it's been a bit hand to mouth, if you've got it, you probably could sell it. And that certainly was the case for us. And really, again sere [ph] wasn't important, people were taking what they could get, and they were opting for higher sere [ph] of choices were available. So, really, I think it hasn't changed much. And again, this is why I think that you run right in from an elongated crewing season in 2020 right into the normal build that we were have, basis what we think could be '21 demand. And that's not normal. Usually there's quite a lot in the action between, August, September, and call it December, January. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that, Mike. And then I'm sure we'll get into, as you said, margin targets in December. But when we look at your adjusted margin in the quarter that's '16 and '17, we obviously know that seasonally strong. But given the mix of residential, hopefully some improvement in Thermo King that's likely to happen in '21, can we actually see operating leverage continue to be higher than gross margin and '21? Is there any reason why your longer-term target wouldn't be at or higher than the target you last gave us we thought about climate margin goals for 2020? Mike Lamach : Yes, I wouldn't, set that as an expectation. Andy, I think that we always like to tell people that the entitlement is probably 85 points, shorter gross margin, giving us an opportunity to continue to really innovate and invest in the business and make sure that we're sitting at - upfront. And of course, incremental margins of 25% against margins that are 16% to 17%, it's all a good problem to have. And, of course we want to raise gross margins overtime. So, that's a good thing to have happen. Occasionally, it happens that we had great productivity in quarter three and excellent price versus material inflation in quarter three, and you can drive outsized leverage in a particular quarter. But in the long run, it's best for us just to think about it the way that we're thinking about it, which is something close to gross margins, leaving room for investment and some breakage around ideas that don't pan out. And that's the way I would try to shape up '21 and beyond. We're not creating a lot of headman going into '21. All of the hourly increases, that we would have given in terms of salary, increase in salary associates happen, like they normally would have normal schedule. And under the delays in salary increases that we pushed out into '21, we brought back into '20. So, what you're seeing here is investment back get a salary increases. And so the only sort of had win probably are tailwind is how much really travel and entertainment we would be doing in '21, as an example. And I think that, frankly, we're rethinking a lot of those things right now, as many companies are about how much business travel, how much entertainment do we need to be doing. Certainly some will come back, but probably never at the levels or unlikely to get levels that they were historically. So, we're not setting up a situation in the reverse, which is really tough leverage coming in at '21. So, I kind of right in the middle and say, 25 is a good number to think about. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks, Mike. Very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hi, good morning. Mike Lamach : Hey, Andy. Andrew Obin : Just a question. How has COVID changed your thinking about consolidation in the HVAC industry? And do you think they're sort of rethinking as to what the setup should be a longer term from a strategic standpoint? Chris Kuehn : Yes, nothing has changed my thinking or thought process around that. I mean, COVID really doesn't have an impact on that. I mean, obviously, it's going to dislocate earnings between companies, but doesn't really change long-term view toward that. It's like it's something that could and should happen. Broader on the M&A question, I think is we think about some of the things that we're doing around the bolt-ons, you've got sellers that want to use 2019 EBITDA and of course, we as a buyer, need to understand the structural changes going forward and the future valuable cash flows that come from that. Conversely if we're looking at things that we're looking to acquire that can be technologies that are helpful in a pandemic. You got seller expectations and breakout EBITDA divergence, so again, you got to go back and structurally look at those future cash flows. But - and then due diligence is a little bit tougher, because most of that is of course remote now, and that's not the best way to do due diligence. So, other than that, it doesn't really change the long-term view toward M&A or transformational M&A. Andrew Obin : And then just a follow up question sort of thinking about key verticals, and specifically offices and institutional. What are the conversations like with your customers about their ability to actually fund sort of the upgrades or even fund normal activity into next year? Have you had those specific conversations? Dave Regnery : Yes, we have Andy, - this is Dave. And obviously, it depends on the customer. But that's what we really developed this whole layered approach in our audits. And we work with our customers to really say, here's your day one opportunity to make your building healthy as it can be right now. And then we give them options to improve going forward. And some of that is 00 I'll give you a real example, we had a customer the other day that wanted to dramatically improve their fresh air exchanges, which makes sense from an indoor air quality standpoint. Unfortunately, the way that building was designed, we would have to put additional cooling capacity to make that happen. And what we worked out with that customer was is what's exchange it to this level, let's get this level today. Let's put a PL in the system for additional cooling capacity. We'll deliver that before the summer months in 2021, so your building is ready. That's a live example of what we're finding with our customer base. Dave Regnery : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi, thank you for squeezing me in here. Appreciate it. And good morning to everyone. Dave Regnery : Good morning, John. John Walsh : I guess just two really quick ones. We took a stab at trying to actually size the indoor air quality TAM, for education, we came up with 3 billion on public disclosures that are out there. We took some Liberty scaling that up to a number north of 30 billion for the entire opportunity. Are we in the right ballpark, as you're looking at it today? I appreciate you don't want to put a dollar number on it, but does that sound right to you? Mike Lamach : Yes, John. I'll tell you the first thing we've been talking about 1.7 trillion square feet of indoor space and 400 billion worth of non-residential space. The answer is got to do something in the billions, right. So I don't think you're - it's just a matter of how does that play out. And in my notion on this is a holistic layered approach mitigating and offering solutions to improve going forward based on the economic capacity of somebody to go and undertake some of these initiatives, it's probably a very long-term tailwind and in a different way to think about space going forward. So it's probably not the size of the market that would be the question. It would be the timing. In my view, it's going to be embedded in growth rate for a very long time. How big is that growth rate? We still don't know, we need to get more experienced here as we go through this with our customers. John Walsh : Great. And it's a question we get, and you're actually talking to the customer. So we'd love to get your perspective. But, once we eventually get a vaccine announcement, do you think that actually slows any of this investment down? Mike Lamach : I can't, because the vaccine for this virus, I mean, there's three vaccine for any virus. And frankly, the reality around future pandemics, I think, is great. And the fact that people do want to have the surety peace of mind around indoor air quality, I don't think it changes. I think it helps open the economy. And I think that has positive benefit. But I don't think it's going to really change how people think about preparation. Just like generally, we used to think about hurricanes hitting Puerto Rico and the Gulf and how we've prepared for those things, and how are we prepared for the aftermath of those things, both from a business continuity perspective, but from a health and welfare of our people perspective. A pandemic, which is something that we had planned for overall health and wellness so we really, from a business continuity perspective, have learned a lot about dealing with the pandemic. So after managing our playbooks are going to change for these pandemics and those playbooks for all customers are going to relate to the health of their space. Dave Regnery : A restaurant that's able to stay open, because they put in all these mitigating factors, where transmission rates clearly are lower, because we've done that all factored into healthier economy one in fact, we have the next crisis. John Walsh : No. that makes a lot of sense. Appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Zac Nagle, for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Good morning. Thank you everyone for joining the call today. Shane and I will be available as always for questions today and obviously over the coming days and weeks. And then, please mark your calendars for December 14 for our Investor Briefing, we will do a deeper dive on Trane Technologies transformation and that will be on 14 with more details to follow. Thank you again, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO; Dave Regnery, President and COO; and Chris Kuehn, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to Slide 3, and I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Mike Lamach : Thanks, Zac, and everyone for joining us on today's call. I think we can all agree that 2020 was an extraordinary year. Around the world we saw the impact of the global pandemic intensify and endangered people, communities, businesses and economies. We saw climate change manifest and several floods wildfires and droughts. Please turn to Slide 3. Even as we responded to these major global challenges we stay true to our long-term strategy. Our team launched Trane Technologies as a focused global climate innovator to boldly challenge what's possible for a sustainable world solving the most pressing and complex challenges facing our customers. We put our purpose and action from day one taking immediate steps to take care of each other and continue serving the essential needs of our customers in the world. I want to thank our global team members for the resilience, tenacity and commitment to rise to the many challenges we faced. At present COVID-19 continue to stay[ph] in risk spread. The vaccine development, production and distribution is underway and our Thermo King business is there to provide full end to end cold chain solutions. Our intent is to enable efficient equitable delivery and administration of the vaccine to as many people as possible to contain and eventually eliminate the spread of the virus. We are also acutely focused on indoor environmental quality to improve the health and safety of indoor spaces. And we believe this is another long-term secular mega trends impacting our industry laid bare and amplified by the pandemic. This is especially critical in education where many children rely on schools for access to technology and food. Virtual learning is broadening the digital divide and having a disproportionate impact and indigenous students and the students of color. It's vital that we open our schools and address an equity in our educational systems. We are applying our expertise and solutions to improve indoor air quality and commercial and residential spaces and balancing that with strategies to improve energy efficiency and reduced emissions. All of this was part of our drive to create a new better normal. At Trane Technologies we are challenging the status quo to create a sustainable future where communities thrive where quality is foundational and where the environment is protected for future generations. We're putting a stake in the ground with historic and aggressive commitments like our Gigaton Challenge, which we launched in 2019 to reduce our customers' carbon emissions by one gigaton by the year 2030, and our commitment to reach gender parity and leadership. We are also a founding member of OneTen a coalition to hire $1 million Black Americans over the next 10 years. We are executing against our transformation plans and blueprint for the future that we discussed at our Investor Day in December to fund ongoing innovation investments in our business aligned to global sustainability trends. We have a responsibility and opportunity for Trane Technologies to be a positive for us to change the industry and ultimately changes the world. Fundamentally pointing all these elements together, we have a business model that delivers sustainable top quartile financial performance and powerful free cash flow combined with our balanced capital allocation strategy we expect to continue to deliver differentiated returns for shareholders over time. Moving to Slide 4. We delivered resilient financial performance throughout 2020 demonstrating the strength of our sustainability strategy and the power of our business operating system. In the fourth quarter we delivered broad based market outgrowth globally. We also delivered strong productivity improvement with the 140 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and 12% adjusted EPS growth in the quarter. We having tumultuous fiscal 2020 with positive organic bookings growth despite significant declines in the majority of our end markets globally. While significantly investing in our business and people, deleverage was just 13% for 2020 which was significantly favorable to our gross margin deleverage target and adjusted EBITDA margins actually increased by 20 basis points on a full year basis. We also delivered exceptional free cash flow of $1.7 billion for the full year, adding to our capital allocation capacity and optionality and extending our track record of delivering free cash flow conversion in excess of 100%. In fact, through 2020 our 5 year average free cash flow to earnings conversion is 116%. And I know many investors realize how focused we are on cash flow ROIC. So, I'm pleased to report that 2020 was an outstanding year for us with an adjusted cash flow ROIC for the year of 34.5% and an adjusted 3 year average of 26.5%. Since the onset of the pandemic, we've been playing aggressive offense to emerge stronger on the other side. We've invested heavily in our people and our business operating system and in innovation for our customers to further advance our leading competitive positions and to outgrow our end markets. In early 2020, we closed on the RMT transaction that would formally launch Trane Technologies. We committed to deliver $100 million in annualized cost savings by 2021, but we didn't stop there. We continue to work on business transformation initiatives in order to fundamentally lower our cost structure and to triple our initial commitment from $100 million to $300 million annualized savings by 2023. These savings bolster our ability to continue delivering leading innovation that both solves complex problems and it's a premium value with our customers. It feels continued market outgrowth while also delivering strong leverage. The pandemic will continue to present significant challenges in 2021 including limiting our visibility and how end markets will perform be a relatively short window of time. However, our guidance reflects optimism for improving end market conditions based on continued progress on vaccine development and approvals sufficient production and supply, efficient distribution and ultimately mass vaccinations globally. At this early stage, we're targeting strong organic revenue growth of between 5% and 7%, and strong organic leverage of approximately 30%. We will also see the benefit of three key channel acquisitions we made in quarter four ended January which are proven high return on investments for us. We have a proven track record of acquiring strong channel and technology partners over many years and delivering excellent returns. Just to give you a sense for the kinds of returns we're targeting recent acquisitions have yielded cash flow ROIC in excess of 40%. We discuss two of these at our recent Investor Day. Including acquisitions, which are expected to add about 1.5 points in growth we're guiding to revenue growth of between 6.5% and 8.5% and adjusted EPS of $5.30 to $5.50 a share. Our strong balance sheet and liquidity profile provide excellent capital allocation capacity and optionality as we look to deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Lastly, our core strategy remains unchanged. Secular megatrends of energy efficiency and sustainability are becoming more pressing every day and we excel at addressing these megatrends and challenging what's possible for a sustainable world. This passion powers us forward to deliver top tier financial performance and differentiated returns for our shareholders. Please go to Slide 5. Strong execution and resilient performance throughout 2020 enabled us to consistently improve our outlook as the year progressed. Each quarter we raised our outlook and advanced our competitive positioning as the leading climate focused innovator to deliver strong 2020 financial results in a challenging environment. We're extremely pleased with what our global team delivered. In the final analysis we delivered a modest revenue decline significantly better than gross margin deleverage and exceptional free cash flow during a global crisis. There's a lot to be proud of. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave to discuss our bookings and revenue performance in the quarter. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Mike. Please turn to Slide number 6. We continue to face pandemic related headwinds in the fourth quarter. Despite these headwinds, our global teams remain focused and responsive to our customers, delivering 3% bookings growth and flattish revenue in the quarter. Our Americas segment delivered growth in both bookings and revenue up 2% and 1% respectively. Our Americas Commercial HVAC business has remained resilient through 2020 with Q4 bookings down mid-single digits against approximately 25% growth on a two-year stack versus 2017 related to large lumpy contracting bookings in 2018 and to a lesser extent 2019. Revenues were also down mid-single digits against high teens comps in Q4 2019 in North America. Services continue to outperform equipment and remain challenged by low building occupancy rates and building closures related to ongoing health and safety concerns. However, our teams remain adapt adjusting to the changing landscape and seizing opportunities to outgrow market conditions in areas such as contracting and digital connectedness and indoor air quality assessments and services. The Residential HVAC markets remain robust and our Residential HVAC team delivered revenue growth of more than 20% in the quarter. Backlog also remains strong entering 2021. Our Americas Transport Refrigeration business outperformed North America Truck and Trailer markets, which were down in the quarter. The team delivered solid revenue growth up low-single digits and strong bookings growth, up over 40% has the transport markets gradually come out of a prolonged down cycle accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Turning to EMEA. The overall markets continue to be challenged by significant pandemic issues and lockdowns that vary by region and country, but our teams continue to execute well. EMEA delivered 9% bookings growth in the quarter, with growth in both Commercial HVAC and Transport Refrigeration. Revenues lagged orders down 6% overall but outgrew underlying market conditions. Commercial HVAC bookings were up high teens, while revenues were down mid-single digits. EMEA Transport bookings were positive in the quarter and revenues were down high single-digits, outperforming the broader transport markets, which were down mid-teens. Asia-Pacific results continue to be mixed with overall bookings up 2% and revenues down 6%. China continues to show signs of improvement. However, growth in China was more than offset by declines in the rest of Asia, or a number of economies are still challenged by the pandemic. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris to discuss our operating performance and margins. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number 7. Dave provided a good overview of our revenues on the prior slide. So I'll focus my comments on margins. Adjusted EBITDA margins were strong, despite a slight revenue decline up 140 basis points driving adjusted EPS growth of 12%. Productivity and cost containment were strong reflecting solid execution across the Board. Our team has also delivered positive price cost in every region during the quarter. In addition, we maintained high levels of business reinvestment and employee safety measures, innovation and technology. Please turn to Slide number 8. In the Americas region market outgrowth, cost containment, productivity and price drove solid EBITDA margin expansion of 130 basis points. Likewise, the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions delivered strong productivity and cost containment to improve EBITDA margins by 110 basis points and 200 basis points respectively versus 2019. A strong productivity is being fueled by our robust pipeline of projects, combined with structural transformation initiatives that Mike referred to earlier, in which we shared at our December industrial event. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave to provide our market outlook. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number 9. Commercial HVAC Americas have significantly outperformed the broader markets throughout 2020 through strong focus, agility and execution. Our service revenue remained resilient growing low-single digits in the fourth quarter despite continued low building occupancy. Interest remains high for comprehensive indoor air quality assessments and we anticipate indoor air quality, providing a tailwind not only in 2021 but over the longer term. And market indicators remain soft and despite limited visibility due to the pandemic, we expect demand improvement in the second half of 2021 with improved vaccine distribution and administration. Turning to Residential. We saw record bookings and revenue in the fourth quarter, which puts us in a strong backlog position entering 2021. Overall, we expect more normalized growth for 2021, with tough comps in the back half of the year given record bookings in revenue in the second half of 2020. Turning to Americas Transport we're expecting strong growth in 2021 with markets emerging from deep down cycles that began in the fourth quarter of 2019. Orders were very strong in the quarter with some customers placing orders for the year. We see market demand ramping through the year with market growth in the mid to high single-digit range in the first quarter. I'll talk more about Transport Refrigeration in our topics of interests. Turning to EMEA. The recovery continues to be country dependent with some countries in additional rounds of lockdowns. It's early to call the recovery broadly in Europe, but we expect improvements heading into 2021 with improved vaccine distribution in the region. Transport markets in particular are expected to emerge from the 2020 down cycle with approximately 8% market growth projection given the current rate of economic improvement. Turning to Asia. We expect continued growth in China in 2021. However, the rest of Asia has been slow to curb the virus and is still largely climbing the path to recovery. On balance, we see a mixed picture for Asia in 2021. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris to outline our guidance for 2021. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number 10. Based on the market backdrop Dave just outlined, and the expectation for an improving pace of global vaccine production and administration we expect to deliver strong financial performance in 2021. As Mike indicated earlier, we expect to deliver strong organic financial performance with organic revenue growth between 5% and 7%, organic leverage of approximately 30% and adjusted EPS of between $5.25 and $5.45. We also expect to see about 1.5 points of revenue growth from the three channel acquisitions which Mike discussed at the outset which will carry about 5 points of operating margin and you deliver EPS accretion of about $0.05 all in total revenue growth is expected to be between 6.5% and 8.5% and EPS is expected to be between $5.30 and $5.50 which translates to a 19% to 23% earnings growth. We expect free cash flow to remain strong at equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net income. If we project current FX rates out to the end of the year FX would likely be a tailwind albeit too early to call, given the global uncertainty and volatility. Our FX exposure is largely translational in nature and each point of revenue we translate at approximately transitional OI rates net each point from FX would translate into about $0.05 of EPS. Please go to Slide number 11. We don't provide quarterly guidance, but given the level of uncertainty and wide range of estimates across the investment community we believe it may be constructive to provide a high level outlook for the quarter, given what we see today. Based on orders, backlog, our pipeline and visibility we currently expect organic revenues to be up approximately 5% in Q1 with strong leverage of between 30% and 35%. Acquisitions are expected to add about a 1.5 of growth, and if FX hold the current rates, FX would add about another point of growth. All in total revenues are expected to be up about 7.5%. As discussed earlier, M&A carries about 5 points of operating margin in the first year after integration-related costs, and each point of FX translates at approximately operating margin rates. Combined, these will add about $0.02 of EPS in the first quarter. There are a couple of items for Q1, that I also want to highlight to help with your models. We're currently expecting corporate costs to be approximately $70 million in Q1. Q1 is primarily impacted by stock-based compensation, which is heaviest in the first quarter based on annual investing and the timing of 2021 corporate expenses, which were more heavily weighted in Q1 than in other quarters. Our transformation activities continue to drive corporate costs lower estimated at $220 million in 2021. So, Q1 has no adverse impact of the full year. However, you may want to incorporate this outlook for modeling purposes. The other item, I want to highlight is the estimated Q1 adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 15%. The Q1 tax rate is traditionally low impacted again by stock-based compensation given annual investing in Q1. The rate in Q1 2020 was roughly 12% as a reference point. The full year 2021 guidance remains 19% to 20%. So, there is no impact of the full year from a seasonally low Q1, but you may want to use this as a guide for modeling purposes. Please go to Slide number 12. As we outlined during our investor event in December by transforming Trane Technologies we initially identified $100 million of fixed cost reductions by 2021. We've exceeded our initial cost reduction expectations delivering $100 million of savings in 2020, a full year early and we expect to deliver $140 million in savings in 2021. We are now targeting and are on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings by 2023. Please go to Slide number 13. Our balanced capital allocation strategy is focused on consistently deploying excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. Despite challenging economic conditions in 2020 we continue to strengthen our core business with high levels of business reinvestment in high ROI technology innovation and operational excellence projects which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership and margin expansion. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We have a longstanding commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. We continue to pursue strategic M&A and further improves long-term shareholder returns and we continue to see value and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. All in, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Please turn to Slide 14. And I'll discuss how we deployed excess cash in 2020, and our plans for 2021. Through the third quarter of 2020 we paused on certain elements of our balanced capital allocation strategy in favor of capital preservation and optionality given the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we did not pause on paying a strong dividend, maintaining our dividend rate and paying over $500 million to shareholders during the year. We also did not pause on paying down $300 million of debt, which matured during the year consistent with expectations upon completion of the RMT. Entering during the fourth quarter, we resumed all elements of our balanced capital allocation strategy based on our strong free cash flow generation and improved visibility to our end markets from earlier in the year. On the M&A front we invested $183 million in value accretive channel acquisitions that Mike as previously discussed. We also deploy $250 million in share repurchases during the quarter and have repurchased an additional $100 million to-date in the first quarter of 2021 for a total of $350 million. Looking at 2021 as a fully reinvesting in the business we plan to continue executing our full balanced capital allocation strategy. This week, we announced that we've increased our quarterly dividend by 11% to $2.36 per share annualized, starting with the payment this March. We also announced a new $2 billion share repurchase program, which adds significant capacity to the existing authorization, which is approximately $400 million remaining. These announcements reflect our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, our commitment to deploying 100% of excess cash over time, and our continued confidence in our ability to deliver powerful free cash flow to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy. We anticipate deploying $1 billion between value accretive M&A and share repurchases. Additionally, we plan to retire $425 million in debt as it reaches maturity in 2021. As I stated earlier, all elements of our balanced capital allocation strategy are in play and we are focused on consistently deploying excess cash to the opportunities with the highest returns to the shareholders. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave and Mike to cover key investor topics of Interest and to close with a summary of key points. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please go to Slide number 16. As we've discussed throughout the presentation we recently completed three channel acquisitions, which has been a proven track to profitable growth for us over the past decade. We've discuss why we're so excited about these acquisitions earlier in the presentation. So I won't spend any more time now. However, we have the slide in the deck for your reference. We'll break out organic versus total revenue each quarter but for modeling purposes, we'd highlight that 80% of the M&A is in the Americas Commercial HVAC and the other 20% is in EMEA HVAC. Please go to Slide number 17. We've covered in this slide earlier in the presentation, so I won't spend a lot of additional time on it now. The objective of this slide is to lay out, how do you think about organic growth and leverage and the impact of the acquisitions. It also provide some helpful modeling guidance elements of the bottom. The key takeaways are that we're expecting strong organic growth, leverage and EPS and that M&A adds additional revenues and modest EPS accretion in 2021. Please go to Slide number 18. When we ask our questions ahead of today's call, we got great feedback. Zac, thank you for that feedback. I'd like to give Zac a hard time but for those of you who know Zac you probably know that he is a bit bigger and stronger than I am. So I need to be a bit careful with that. All kidding aside, transport refrigeration and how to think about the markets versus our global transport refrigeration business was a question on nearly everyone's list. As a result, we continue to provide as much detailed transparency as we can. While at the same time keeping competitive sensitive information safe and the story, simple enough to explain to your colleagues. On the left side of the chart, you can see in the markets for the big three markets in Transport Refrigeration, Trailer, Truck and APU. The numbers in the boxes are based on published act in IHS data for North American EMEA and are therefore recognizable to many of you. After the down cycle in 2020 that was accelerated by the pandemic. The forecast points for an emergence from the down cycle into a strong rebound in 2021 with the big three up approximately 34% in North America and up 9% in EMEA. We've highlighted this point before but it's important to note. Our Transport Refrigeration businesses are highly diverse, which makes us more resilient through cycles. While two-thirds of our business is comprised of the big three that most of you follow closely, roughly a third of our Transport Refrigeration business is comprised of marine, bus, rail, air and aftermarket parts and services. What we refer to on the Slide is all other for lack of a more catchy freights. These businesses are also forecast -- show growth in 2021 up between 5% and 10% in both regions with varying dynamics for each business. In order to understand the total forecast for transport we need to look at the weighted average growth based on our mix of business and the respective growth rates of each market. The middle box on the right, does the math for you, so you don't need to calculate it. Again trying to make this as simple as possible, despite some complexity given the wide range of products and markets. Net the weighted average growth rate for Transport Americas is approximately 26%, and it's 8% for EMEA. We have a strong position in each of these market segments and are excited to be entering what is setting up to be a strong growth year for Thermo King. Lastly, we continue to see opportunities for us to help solve COVID-19 crisis through vaccine storage and distribution. As you've seen from all the news reports the logistical challenges are tremendous. Countries and states are taking different paths roles of the supply and administration. We're seeing good activity across our comprehensive vaccine storage and distribution portfolio with more to come. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks. Mike? Mike Lamach : Thanks, Dave. Please go to Slide 19. We continue to see strong demand for what we do in a growing movement around what we stand for energy efficiency and sustainability megatrends are only growing stronger and we are uniquely positioned to deliver innovation that intersects with these trends and accelerate the world's progress. Even as we responded to market challenges and uncertainty caused by the global pandemic we leveraged our strong financial position and continue to invest in our businesses launching more than 50 new solutions in 2020 to meet the needs of our customers. And we're not only focused on investments in innovation and growth, but also on investments in business transformation. We are on track to deliver savings that improve the cost structure of the company and enable additional reinvestment to expand margins and further strengthen our ability to outgrow our end markets. When combined with the long-term sustainability megatrends underpinning our end markets, our exceptional ability to generate free cash flow and balanced capital deployment of 100% of excess cash over time, we are well positioned to continue to drive differentiated shareholder returns. I've said that Trane Technologies has the essence of a start-up with the credibility of a market leader that unique profile fosters a culture of inclusion, ingenuity and performance. It's this type of passion and purpose that sets Trane Technologies, a part it is how we will change the industry and ultimately change the world. And now, Chris, Dave and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, good morning, everybody. Dave Regnery : Hey, Joe. Good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Hey, Mike or Dave, maybe to start on just the Commercial HVAC trends and just the bifurcation that you're seeing in Americas versus EMEA, at least for the quarter. I mean I know some of it was comps driven, but that seems to be a question that we're getting from the few investors this morning. Mike Lamach : Hey, Joe your question is around the fourth quarter? Joe Ritchie : Yes, more around the fourth quarter and the bookings trends and then what you're seeing, I guess to start the year on Commercial HVAC specifically? Dave Regnery : Sure, no problem. Our commercial -- let me start in EMEA, okay. And our commercial business in EMEA has been strong all year. And a lot of that is fuel, not necessarily by the market but more has to do with the innovation that we've been able to introduce into the market. So we're seeing a lot of uptick in our heat pump technologies as well as we're entering into the industrial air cooling space. So I would say EMEA is more led by the innovation side and you saw the strong bookings we had in the fourth quarter. In the Americas, we had some really tough comps there. You have to remember that two-year stack were up over 25%. So we actually did exactly what we thought we would do in the Americas, it was down, but again comparing the stack that we are up against we're okay with our performance there. Our business in the Americas we're seeing strength in certain verticals certainly data centers, warehousing, and we see those trends continuing into 2021. Joe Ritchie : Okay. Great, Thanks. Maybe my one follow-up question, just sticking with the guidance you guys provided, are try to be -- with. So thank you for that. And I think about just the what you're expecting from a market standpoint on the transport side and Americas? And then also with strong resi backlog heading into 2021 in the Americas business, it looks like just simplistically with those two businesses, you can get kind of a mid-single digit number for Americas growth, I guess how are you thinking about then the growth on the Americas business for 2021 and specifically out of Commercial HVAC, if you could provide color there. Dave Regnery : Sure, this is Dave. Again, I'll start and Mike can add. But will start in the Transport Americas it's pretty clear and I just spoke about in the appendix there but are the topics of interest rather. So we think the Americas will ramp through the year in our Transport business. Overall, we're estimating that the growth rate there would be a little north of 25% and that's good to see. Our fourth quarter bookings in transport really support our assumptions going in to the opportunity to 2021 year and residential very strong fourth quarter revenue growth over 20%, nice bookings that we saw there. We anticipate that 2021 will be more of a normalized year in totality. So we're thinking the low-single digits maybe gets up to mid-single digits. However, it's going to be choppy, right. We're going to have some very tough comps in the back half of the year just because of the strength that we saw in 2020. In the Americas this is going to be a first half, second half. We're anticipating the second half to be stronger than the first half and a lot of that's going to be led by vaccine distribution and the administration of those vaccines into people's arms. Mike Lamach : Joe, I would say we were optimistic that we're going to get this right, from a distribution perspective on vaccines. And I can tell you from our company's perspective, we're working with a very large healthcare provider in the Southeast and bringing not only the cold storage capability, but logistics and lean capability to think about giving shots and tack time like we run and operation into plan. And we have Industrial friends and colleagues working with other health care providers to do the same and if that sort of thing that gives me some optimism that we're going at this thing right. We're concerned about, obviously the efficacy of the vaccine against variants, and that could be an issue. But again, we're optimistic that vaccines will be have efficacy because of RNA technology basically being able to quickly adapt to that. We also think there's some potential wildcards that could be helpful. One would be to the extent in the US, we've got federal support to schools around helping with ventilation is an example to the extent that you could see that funding disbursed. And it will be a formulaic disbursement much like federal funding happens with schools. You would see potentially if vaccine gets on quick enough maybe between May and September an opportunity to really impact schools as well, but it's not, I mean eventually that's going to flow I believe to helping valuation and obviously we're a big player in ventilation in schools. So we're not like counting on that per say but there is an opportunity for us if that were to happen. I think over a multi-year period we seek some benefit from that as well. Joe Ritchie : Sounds good. Thanks, guys. Operator : You're next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning. Julian Mitchell : Maybe one question on the operating leverage. So Mike, you had mentioned that you're assuming about 30% organic leverage better than that mid '20s placeholder because of the mix and the savings. Just wondered what's dialed in for that leverage number regarding price material spread? Do we get maybe a lag on the offset of those input costs for a quarter or two and your comfort around offsetting those higher costs? Mike Lamach : Yes. Starting point Julian just to color before I turn it really to Chris on that would be the organic leverage you know is actually quite high, but when you had sort of point -- you have a 1.5 of acquisitions, which carry no or very little leverage, and then you had FX, which translates really only at operating leverage. You kind of come down to that 30 range. As it relates to the price cost, we do about this on our normal operating cadence. We understand the input costs. We understand what our operating system told us to do. We've been successful for a long period of time about implementing that and so we're going to target that the typical 20%, 30% basis points that we would see in that relative to both innovation and just price absorbing any sort of [indiscernible] that we have in commodity costs. Chris, may be why don't you color on both leveraging commodities? Chris Kuehn : Yes. Hi, Julian, it's Chris. I would tell you that again our current inflation right now what we see is included in that 30% full year organic leverage guidance, but to Mike's point we enter every year thinking in our playbook at 20 to 30 basis point improvement price over cost. And some of that's really executed through our typical strategies around locking strategy, so for copper we're entering into any period generally 70% locked and were over 50% locked from a full year perspective. The timing of our steel purchasing those lead times are about six months. So that gives us some visibility to think about how we pricing the marketplace at that point. So those are just part of our standard playbook. And at the same time, we'll look at pricing throughout the year is necessary to make sure that we're still executing to the 20 or 30 basis points. But, so to Mike's point we have been here before. We understand the variables and right now we're just executing our normal playbook. Julian Mitchell : Thank you. And maybe just one follow-up, perhaps for you mostly Chris. Free cash flow is very, very good, $1.7 billion I think in '20 but that was with a steep drop in CapEx and some big working cap tailwinds. So just trying to understand how difficult or easy it will be this year to match that $1.7 billion sort of absolute number. What kind of headwind we should expect this year from CapEx rebounding and may be working capital reversing? Chris Kuehn : Hey Julian, good question. So elaborate. As you said, we're very happy with our performance in 2020 and the conversion, 158% conversion. For 2021 we are guiding to a 100% free cash flow conversion. So, I don't think that's at the $1.7 billion level, that's had a much lower level from a conversion perspective based on the guide we gave of $5.40 at the midpoint. But I would tell you know year-over-year we're going to have some stronger earnings that's expected. We absolutely intend to continue to reinvest in the business, that's part of our model for 100% free cash flow conversion. I do expect some strategically, let's say modest working capital expansion. As you noted were down a little bit over 1% working capital at the end of 2020. I don't see us necessarily going back to the levels we had in 2019. I think we've learned a lot about what we need in the business, and while I expect some of that to come back a bit, it really will come back to really support our expected growth in the year. CapEx was still in our 1% to 2% range for final amounts in 2020, and I expect that to still be 1% to 2% for 2021. So, otherwise, I think we've got all the right metrics in place to go execute at 100% managing our working capital as earnings grow and expected growth and then funding the business as we need to. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Scott. Scott Davis : This may be tough, but is it possible able to quantify the vaccine distribution opportunity. I mean it seems like we're going to be given out vaccines for years to come, I would imagine. So this is a new business for you guys in many ways, or at least new at the scale. So where do you think about sizing it at all? Mike Lamach : Yes, I think RNA technology and the need for cold storage add max volumes is something that every healthcare system ultimately every state is going to provide for some capacity. This could look like much like a flu shot or a booster shot, every year in my mind, and RNA technology becomes more prevalent for other situations again you're needing cold storage for that to take place as well. So I think that's sufficient capacity and certainly will be growth in the more traditional modes of transport refrigeration thinking about traitor and truck and air and so on and so forth, but I do think some of the cold-storage the mobile large scale cold storage devices are going to be a longer-term opportunity. In the short run, I would say that when you tend to have a centralized government response with the National Healthcare System it seems to be going quicker and we seem to have more need, more demand for the large-scale storage capacity solutions that we have. As you see these larger mass vaccination sites and that becomes more obvious that there some wasted vaccine and you see that the apps in the lines of people queuing for any vaccine it's going to get way through at the end of a day. I believe you're going to see more demand for larger scale kind of mobile storage in the pop-ups going along. So long story short, there is an element of this, which will be a surge in 2021. But there's probably a structural element to readiness as it relates to countries, cities states for more cold storage and more of an ongoing remediation or ongoing capacity to handle this type of vaccine. Scott Davis : And just to draw a line little bit further. I mean is it to the point where you could say with some level of confidence that this is a 1% tailwind to your growth rate or two? Is it is a smaller than that, and it's just, it's so far below one that which we shouldn't think about it at all as much material move in the model? Chris Kuehn : Yes, Scott, I wouldn't size it. I wouldn't take the risk of sizing it, because we're learning a lot about it. I will say it's -- we're really I would say disrupting the game because there's never been cold storage at these temperatures with these capacities. And if you think about sort of the old way of looking at a cold pharma logistics center these would have been larger sort of residential freezers or what would have gone into a, even a major hospital necessarily might have been a larger looking residential freezer, you know the size of that as opposed to something that could be 10/10,10/20 or even larger something that would be portable. It can run on short power, it can run on diesel. It can be moved and managed telematically. So, and if you think about the cost to store a dose, it's a fraction literally a tiny fraction of the cost in the industry. So this is disruptive. Dave's comments moving to industrial refrigeration is disruptive and that we can provide a better industrial process cooling solution using ammonia and safer more energy and efficient. So these are some of the more disruptive things that we're thinking about. It's hard to put a number on the big markets. Scott Davis : Yes, interesting. Chris Kuehn : Scott, just a little extra color on the vaccine distribution. I was working with, well as Mike said earlier, we're working with the local health care provider here in the Carolinas on helping them with logistics, we started to talk through their storage need and the first response was well, right now we don't have enough vaccine. So we don't have a storage need. And that is our team started to ask the follow-on questions with these mRNA vaccines and are they going to go away or more to come. They realize that a deep freeze container like we can provide gives then ultimate flexibility. And at the end of May, they made purchases based on the fact that they wanted to make sure that they will not be any kind of healthcare provider, they had to destroy any vaccines because they were not kept at the right temperature. Scott Davis : Seems like we need you here, no -- Mike send you guys up to New Jersey. So could use some help. Anyways I'll pass it on. Good luck to everybody. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Scott. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hey guys, good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning, Steve. Dave Regnery : Hey, Steve. Steve Tusa : Just follow up on -- first of all, congrats on the great execution as usual. Just following up on Scott's question, what's the actual benefit you guys think you saw in 20 from all this vaccine stuff? Or what kind of run rate are you at right now on that? I mean you just talked about booking in order that you could kind of identify based on this trend? Maybe just give us a little more financial color around this just so you know the basis? Chris Kuehn : Yes, it's, we have certainly both in turned a lot in the indoor air quality space but systems don't capture nuances and change orders and tweaks that may be related to that. So it's hardly worth the effort. And that's why I think it's really a structural long-term change in the way that standards are applied to buildings and ultimately codes, and then how that moves across the world, and this is why I'm convinced, it's going to be, you know, a permanent IAQ change. With regard to cold storage and vaccines. Because of the capacity, so we can store these things and the finite number of pop-up hospitals and sites, it's not a large single opportunity. It's really something that structurally, I think will change to my earlier comment about readiness whether that is FEMA, and other country response organizations that are prepared or major medical centers and regions of the country that will have capacity that will be different than they had in the past from out storage. So it's not going to be a huge thing, but it's just another critical link in the cold chain, it's another opportunity to apply something that is more disruptive in terms of what was thought to be medical storage, cold storage in the past and then getting into these temperatures of minus 94 offers an example. It's no small feat. So we're looking for other ways and applications to be able to use that process for getting to that to look at other applications for cold storage. Steve Tusa : So is it like in the 10s of millions of revenues right now, or $100 million in revenues, like just roughly like where are you kind of just within kind of to scope it within the universe like what 10s million, 100 million in that range. Mike Lamach : Steve I appreciate your persistence in asking the question three, four times and we not [indiscernible] one time. But I'm not going to go there. So, got you. Steve Tusa : And I guess just two simple questions detailed. What for your total commercial HVAC equipment business? Roughly, what is your expectation for this year? Is it up kind of mid-singles for commercial global commercial equipment revenue? And then what was the difference between sell-through with your captive distribution and independent distribution and residential? And thanks. Dave Regnery : Okay. So, it's a two questions. One is, what's our Commercial HVAC equipment look globally. And then specific again separate question to rise, what's the sell-in and sell-through kind of thing? Steve Tusa : Yes, yes, correct. For 4Q for resi and then for 2021 for commercial equipment. Dave Regnery : Yes. I'll start Steve this is Dave. I'll start with the resi question first. It was a strong quarter for us for residential, up 20%. And remember, we're 50-50, okay. So 50% independent wholesalers, 50% company owned. If you look just at the IWD, they had some strong sell-through in the fourth quarter, it was in the mid-teens. So obviously our sell-in was more than that as they adjust their inventory levels, but there sell-through was in the mid-teens, which is -- which was encouraging for us. On the global basis for the applied, I guess on the global basis, you'd probably have it right, it's probably up in the low-single digit range. Zac Nagle : Thanks, Steve. Operator we can move to the next question. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. John Walsh : Hi, good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning. How are you? John Walsh : Good, thanks. So, just thinking about kind of the embedded greenhouse gas reduction opportunity that sits in the installed base of the commercial buildings. We've recently seen a government report that laid out a scenario where only about 20% of buildings, and 30% of square footage that was built before 2008 had actually upgraded their HVAC equipment. Does that sound right to you? Do you think that the actual installed base, there has been that little of upgrade historically? And I'm just thinking about how that you know conversion might change if we start getting some stimulus or energy policy? I don't know if there is a way to look at what you've seen in Europe kind if apply it to the US, but would love to get your thoughts on those numbers? Chris Kuehn : Yes, John what I'd say is, I'm going to go back end of the call and record what you just said, because you've actually explain the launch of Trane Technologies is probably better than I have over the last year. It's exactly what we think is an enormous opportunity. The data, the size that we're looking at you're talking about $400 billion square feet, it's just commercial space communal space. It's pretty tough for anybody to have a high degree of accuracy on that, but the reality is, and what we know and experience and what our teams tell us around the world is tremendous opportunity to upset[ph] upgrade. And this will happen, I mean you can look at what's happening in the EU as an example. It's just amazing looking at the electrification of heat as an example and look at the map in Europe and the refrigerant deadlines that you are seeing not only standards change but codes and law changing around this. Again, the point about being happy with heat pump growth. We're five generations in now with the electrification of heat in Europe. We five generations, five years into that process, and if you go back over a long period of time in Europe, you've seen really strong growth rates for us in that area -- for just showed strong growth rates period in a flattish economy. So it really makes the case for why we spoke to the company. Why we think that this is a multiple GDP business. At the end of the day investors buy a portfolio or an idea. Hopefully they buy a business model that they feel confident in the delivery and they buy management team that can deliver on that. So you're making the case for why we think that Trane Technologies this is our future. John Walsh : Got you. I should probably just pass it there. But let me try to sneak in another one. Chris Kuehn : You should drop the microphone and walk away now, John. John Walsh : Just thinking about that $1 billion placeholder for M&A and repo. You seem to be pushing us at least towards the repo for our models, but kind of what does that pipeline look like when it comes to, I would assume more bolt-on type acquisitions that are out there in large? Chris Kuehn : It's a great question and I appreciate the opportunity to clarify that. We give you a billion because we know how difficult it is for you to model M&A, right. It depends on when you do it and what it is and so on and so forth. So we're giving you is something that you can count on which is we're going to deploy $1 billion of cash toward these things. We very much love the 20 plus deals we've done in the last three, four, five years that has all been extraordinarily profitable in terms of ROAs. Soon wanted to do more of those. And so if we could find the right opportunities we will. And as you know, often coming out of a recession, coming out of the downturn there is opportunity, and we feel like we've got the capacity to be able to do that. So we Haven't yet model that because you need to do something with the cash and some of the capital and we're trying to give you a minimum expectation, but if we found outstanding M&A to go to do, we're going to go do that because there is -- that's really the compounding effect. And, yes this is one of the reasons we've seen cash flow ROIC be what it is, which has been top quartile now for years in terms of the industrial sector. And yes, we don't want any more of it. John Walsh : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks. Good day, everyone. Mike Lamach : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, just two quick hopefully easy ones from me. First just on TK, and I appreciate all that great detail. I also just wanted to kind of get my arms around the operating leverage there. Obviously historically highest margin piece of the portfolio. I'm just wondering if the deleverage in 2020 took margins below segment average and does your guidance today, kind of take TK back up above the segment average. Chris Kuehn : I'll start, Jeff. I think back in 2020 the TK business delevered with the lower volumes, but I think with our playbook they stay within their gross margins for the year. For 2021, we see that as part of our, a bit of tailwind and that's what modeling 30% organic leverage on the full year, about five points higher than where our long-term target is. Our long-term target being 25%, but we're seeing 2021 beginning the year with some higher leverage organically at the 30% level, fueled by the TK growth as well as the transformation savings that we're continuing to improve on a year-over-year basis as well. Jeff Sprague : Great, thanks for that. And also just wondering maybe picking up on Dave's answer on the Commercial Equipment outlook. How are backlogs relative to your forward sales projections as we start the year normal way above what you would see? Any little color there would be helpful, I think. Dave Regnery : Yes, I'd say, our backlogs are strong coming into 2021. We're up in the mid-teens, which is nice to see. So, and good activity there. Chris Kuehn : Yes, Jeff I recognize when we think about backlogs we are only looking at equipment. We're not looking at sort of the service contracts and that sorts of things. So what's Dave saying is really healthy, right. That's a good backlog kind of pushing into the year and then obviously we expect to renew and grow our service arrangements and relationships with customers as well. Jeff Sprague : Great, that's helpful. Very solid, guys. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Chris Kuehn : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Hey, Andy. Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : So your services business obviously has been relatively stable over the last couple of quarters up low-single digits in North America. Could you talk about what is embedded into your 2021 forecast for North American global Commercial HVAC services? And then, given the focus on IAQ, can you give a rough idea of what is the percentage of assessments that have resulted in small changes to existing systems versus major upgrades at this point? Mike Lamach : Services are going to continue to grow and in some ways we're building some, we're not open and and people deferred expect there to be a very good service growth this year. I mean even in the Americas with Commercial Americas and the Dodge data kind of pointing down run some of the stuff. We think is a pathway between you realize, that's about 15% of really, kind of how we would think about modeling our business anyway, but the reality is that the retrofits that we would do -- key work and the deferred service that would be happening should give us a pathway to see some growth while albeit maybe lower but growth in Commercial Americas next year. Almost every IAQ survey we do amounts to some business because what we realized as we do these things and we've got teams out there, let's just go fix the stuff that we can fixed right away while we're there. So it's invariable that now you being paid for the survey you're being paid for the really quick stop that -- go get done. And then obviously the long tail, and this becomes the proposals around asset renewal and the customers' capacity to pay for some of these things to get to an optimal model. And they request that as day two getting the customer ready for the long term and being part of that capital planning, our maintenance planning model going forward. So it's a very, very high relationship between sort of doing surveying and doing work. Dave Regnery : Well, I totally agree with told you, Mike. The day two activity that we're seeing is starting to pick up. And as Mike said, remember our indoor air quality are based on the system view. So as we're upgrading on the day two opportunities, it's really about embedding a lot of IAQ solutions into the system. And that activity is going nicely for us. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that, guys. And then maybe just can you give us some more color on what's happening in Asia? You mentioned China strength is continuing its being offset by weakness in the rest of Asia. You did see what looks like an inflection in bookings in Asia this quarter despite the interruption. So, are you seeing an overall uptick led by China? And what's the outlook embedded in 2021 forecast for HVAC [ph]? Chris Kuehn : Yes. We continue to Asia -- I mean China has recovered nicely from the pandemic. Okay. And we continue to see good results there. The rest of Asia is really spotty and it's really country specific and they're really struggling with the pandemic. For 2021 we think it's going to be a mixed year. We believe that China will continue to perform and we're confident that they will. The rest of Asia, it's going to be -- let's get this vaccine distributed and let's show the economies hopefully the economy start to come back in the second half of the year and we think that will almost rebuilt into our models. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, guys. Keep up the good work. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Andy. Mike Lamach : Thank, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey, good morning, guys. Mike Lamach : Hey, Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : So, I'll just keep it to one question. I appreciate you kind of running over on the call here. Mike, there is a lot of discussion both in US and Europe with all this kind of green new deal type stuff, and not a lot of ink spilled about what the specifics look like. Presumably, you guys are kind of going to bat with kind of various lobbying and standard writing procedures. What is it that you're actually kind of pushing for that you guys would view is like, hey, this is a really smart and efficient way to go about incentivizing folks or penalizing folks or whatever. And what would be kind of a less efficient model like what are those conversations look like? And what would be kind of a good outcome in your view? Mike Lamach : Yes, I mean the technology exists to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from air conditioning, refrigeration systems. Now today we've had it out for five, six years at this point in time. And so when you think about bending the curve on a quarter to a third of the world's carbon emissions by '23, it's a shame not to go do the easiest thing, which is a technology that's already been invented and we've done this. It's out in the marketplace. The added advantage is we beginning it about 2015 and 2016. No longer had to ask customers to pay a premium for it because we actually design all system efficiencies to be lower than the high greenhouse gas emission solutions that are out there for the space. So we want to see codes, standards, laws, rules changed that would limit this. And it's not that you don't need to take the tax you could, you could put a price on it, doesn't really matter. We're giving customers an economic motivation to do this, because the paybacks are better and taken all the greenhouse gas emissions out and that's what we're trying to leave. That's what the whole Gigaton Challenge we launched was. This is in 2015 when we had science-based targets. Now, we were the first maybe industrial, but for sure the first HVAC company that science based targets approved. We finish those 2020 targets in 2018, and so you're launched to 2030 commitments, and we are actually hoping -- that later today. We've actually received approval from the committee that approved science based commitments. Of course it takes years to be able to do that and it takes thousands of thousands of internal hours to put those plans together and the make sure that the base in science and approved. But fundamentally, it's changing laws, codes, standards to avoid gas emissions from HVAC refrigeration period. Josh Pokrzywinski : So you see it more as code base than incentive based? Mike Lamach : No. I would see it more as economic based. The reason we're winning because we're not asking people to make the choice. We're saying we're going to give you the best total cost of the ownership and we're going to knock out the emissions in the process and we're winning. And others are going to follow, because they need to take the same approach, right. I mean you need to become more energy efficient, and you need to do that with a better carbon emissions profile. And we could wait for codes in 2025 and 2030 and all the stuff, but we don't need to. The innovation is there. So more that we can make this an economic benefit we don't need to wait for codes and standards. But when you get to the tail end of this thing, yes, sure standards help, codes help all those things kind of lock it in. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. Appreciate. Thanks, guys. Mike Lamach : Thanks, Josh. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Andrew Obin : Good morning. Just couple of simple questions from me. First one on unitary market in North America. How do you look at the health of the unitary market right? Because I think if you look at the broader commercial markets right hospitals and schools and universities looked like they're quite well funded from bond issuance and all that good stuff. But how do you look at sort of smaller commercial market, you know, with a lot of restaurants herding, there's a lot of retail herding, can you just compare and contrast the dynamic in the unitary market with the applied market? Thank you. Mike Lamach : Well, in the market, I mean that's the place, you don't want to be right, if your business model is around like commercial and it's around big box retail national accounts and those sorts of things. I mean that's clearly kind of where the rather than the risk is, but again, I'm confident that eventually we're going to be able to open the economy, people are going to go spend time in social restaurants and movie theaters. And if you're looking for a proxy of that when the things start to really improve its when the people you know that have been the most careful in this pandemic feel comfortable eating inside and going to the movie theater, but those markets are going to be tough, and you hear about restaurants and small businesses, maybe being closed at a 30% rate, permanently closed. But clearly there is unitary markets, that absolutely are booming and it's about warehousing and people shopping online because just they don't go to retail and the fact to get people in warehouse to work. They need to be conditioned spaces. And so what we are warehouses more conditioned. We're seeing them condition today. You're seeing that in a lot of markets. But the net of it is you got to keep an eye on markets that are going to grow that are not really structurally impaired and you got to be cautious about the white commercial retail markets. And we made that decision,10 years ago about what we wanted to play, which was data centers and warehousing, those sorts of places. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it. And just a follow-up question. You sort of started out talking about your acquisition. I was a little bit late. So I apologize, but two questions. Right now you have this balance between owned and independent. So, how much can you sort of move the needle going forward to owning the channel? And how do you look at a trade-off right between owning the channel, super stable high margin revenue stream. You can look what Alaska is trading very healthy multiple for the markets in hand. The amounts of the long-term, but at the same time, what we've heard from the dealers look standalone dealers are lot more entrepreneurial and sort of long-term how do you think about the balance between independent channel versus owning the channel? Mike Lamach : Yes. Thanks, Andy. And then you realize that dealers are now at ubiquitous term here in our company, right. Andy Kaplowitz : It's long-term I know dealers as the long term. Actually, I -- Mike Lamach : Just to clarify those -- TK is going to always be an independent channel for us. Our commercial business is 90% commercial channel going to 100. And our residential channel is 50-50 and that's the only place that we make an analytical decision to say what's best for share and margin expansion. And somebody do it better locally. Do we need to do it? How do we grow? So our view is TK independent, Commercial HVAC is going to be wholly owned indirect. And then Residential is going to the US discussion in Canada. It's going to be mixed with the sole focus on margin and market share. Andy Kaplowitz : Great answer. Thank you. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead. Gautam Khanna : Yes, thank you for taking my question this way. And congrats on the quarter. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Gautam Khanna : Most of my questions have been asked, but I'm just curious about two things. One, anything incrementally you've seen competitively that's changed. There was talk about Goodman having some COVID related interruptions in the latter part of last year. And I just wondered if there were any kind of weird things that may not recur in '21 that may have benefited results in '20? And then relatedly maybe just longer term, what do we think about some of the codes and standards? And I think there is like a 2023 mandate on different refrigerant and what have you. Just can you remind us of some of the upcoming regulatory potential drivers of product changes and demand? Thank you. Mike Lamach : You welcome. On the first part of the end-to-end, simple answer is no. We're not seeing a lot of difference and 2020 was a year that I'm sure that more than one company would have had issues, one way or the other, and clearly it was a strange year in that regard, but the competitive dynamics largely remain intact, and our strategy fundamentally remains intact because over a long period of time now we we've been winning with it. So, back to [indiscernible] question, we are absolutely all about market share and margin and rest is [indiscernible] and look forward to competing with competitors that structurally may or may not have had issues but fundamentally going forward, it's a market where efficiency ratings aside and your input costs are fairly known and if somebody is going to drop price precipitously we can tell you a point drop in price you better get 10 points of revenue to offset that because that's about the math on that equation. So, I don't think it's going to be any strange behavior happening in the markets going forward. Dave on the 2023? Dave Regnery : Yes. Hi, Gautam. On the 2023 you're right there is an efficiency change. We're ready for it, okay actually a lot of our portfolio today already leads that efficiency change as far as refrigerant, I think that was your second and follow-on there. The next refrigerant change really is 2025 in California. And again, we're looking at different options there and then there's some time that was originally going to be 2023, it got pushed back a bit by California 2025. So short answer is 2023 yes, where our team is now working on that for a while lot about portfolio already quality meets that requirement and the refrigerant is out a few years. Gautam Khanna : Thanks a lot guys. Dave Regnery : Thank you. Operator : Your last question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital. Please go ahead. Jeff Hammond : Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in. Mike Lamach : Hey, Jeff. Jeff Hammond : Just two quick ones. On resi you said strong backlogs. Do you think that kind of the second half growth rates are sustainable into the first half. Just going to give them backlogs and people wanting to kind of ensure supply and we have the stay at home dynamic? Mike Lamach : No, no. I think you just kind of going into more normalized behavior. So system anomaly in 2020. So no, it's really tough comps. Jeff Hammond : No, no, I mean, I'm just speaking to the first half. And it just seems like dealers and distributors want to kind of be fully stock given they were caught short. There does seem to be kind of strong backlogs as you said, end of the first half. Dave Regnery : Jeff, it's going to be the first half is going to be easier comps, obviously than the second half. And we know what -- here everyone knows what happened last year. There was a little conservative coming into the season some heat hit and then all of a sudden they're going get called or some of the RWD has caught a bit short. So, but it's going to be a first half-second half phenomenon. But overall, as Mike said, we expect a more normal year for resi. Mike Lamach : Yes, I think a lot of distributors too waiting just like we're waiting to see all of those, sort of what's happening with vaccine distribution, efficacy and markets opening, but there is a bias, not to get cut short in terms of inventory, but if there is a general reopening and people in some scale level are returning back to the office and work, you would see obviously a little bit of shift maybe away from overshooting that. Jeff Hammond : Okay, great. And then just on transport. You called out some outgrowth in 4Q. Just wondering what your visibility is for outgrowth and transport versus the detail you gave on kind of the markets? Dave Regnery : I think we're going to have a great growth year for Thermal and the Americas as well as Europe will be a little bit less, but -- Mike Lamach : Look at the big super freezers. We got a great product just launched four to six months ago and in all of Europe, it's doing well. So yes, I mean, I don't think you might get into the sort of what we're embedding in terms of share gain there, but we would expect to outperform the market and then report that out to you as that happens. Jeff Hammond : Okay. I appreciate it, guys. Mike Lamach : Thank you. Operator : That's all the time we have for questions today. I will now turn the call back to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Thank you, operator. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call and especially for staying on few minutes after our typical scheduled time to hear more questions and answers. So, we appreciate your time. Jen and I will be around for questions, as always over the next few days and weeks and then we look forward to seeing you all hopefully on the road live at some point in 2021. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac Nagle : Thanks operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com where you will find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website.

Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Mike Lamach, Chairman and CEO, Dave Regnery, President and COO and Chris Kuehn, Senior Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to slide three and I will turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Mike Lamach : Thanks Zac and everyone for joining us on today's call. Please turn to slide three. While the pandemic continues to present significant challenges around the world, our strategy as a global climate innovator remains steadfast. We are innovating rapidly to address complex and pressing sustainability challenges for our customers and for our planet. This is even more critical as the clock is ticking on climate change and the battle intensifies. Our aggressive goals and bold actions can dramatically reduce carbon emissions and accelerate the world's progress. We are committed to making a difference, consistently, relentlessly and over the long term. Our unwavering focus on innovation has been fundamental to our ability to drive market outgrowth and share gains in recent years and it continues to be a path forward for long term value creation. At Trane Technologies, we have never built strategies around episodic investments, which may increase for a year or two to drive growth and then slow in favor of margin or cash or any changing new priority. Our approach is markedly different. We remain confident in our ability to lead, precisely because our investments are continuous and ongoing. They are focused on a clear purpose driven strategy, a consistent operating system and goals and expectations focused always on top quartile results for our stakeholders. This relentless approach drives market outgrowth, which in turn helps us deliver strong margins and powerful free cash flow to deploy through our balanced capital allocation strategy. The end result is more value across the board for our team, for our customers, for our shareholders and for the planet. Moving to slide four. Our global teams drove exceptional performance in the first quarter, which positions us well as we look towards the balance of the year. We delivered broad-based market outgrowth and share gains in each of our segments and business units with total enterprise organic revenues up 11%, while at the same time delivering more than 400 basis points of margin expansion in every segment and for the enterprise as a whole. We delivered double digit bookings growth in all segments growing our backlog over 30% sequentially versus December 2020 and up more than 30% versus our already strong backlog at the end of 2019 heading into 2020. Adjusted earnings growth was also exceptional, up 135%. Although it's still early in the year and overall visibility remains limited, our strong quarter one performance, growing backlog, improving markets and optimism for improved vaccination rates gives us confidence to raise our full year 2021 guidance for both revenue and adjusted EPS above the high end of the prior ranges. We also continued to make excellent progress towards our transformation savings goal of $300 million by 2023 and expect to realize approximately $190 million in total savings in 2021. That's up from $100 million in 2020. These transformation savings help fund superior innovation, market outgrowth and share gains with sustainable, strong leverage. We expect our strong growth and leverage in 2021 to once again deliver powerful free cash flow which further strengthens our balance sheet and fuels our balanced capital allocation strategy. We have raised our capital deployment expectations for 2021 by $500 million from approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion as we continue our commitment to deploying 100% of excess cash over time. Lastly, our core strategy remains focused on secular, sustainability megatrends of energy efficiency and sustainability which are becoming more pressing every day. A few weeks ago, we were one of just a handful of companies to achieve validation for our second set of science-based targets on our path to net zero carbon emissions. For those of you who know us well, you know sustainability as been at our core for a very long time. Our first of science-based targets were approved in 2014. And we achieved those in 2018. We also have revised our annual incentive compensation plan for approximately 2,300 leaders beginning this year to link directly to ESG metrics, including both carbon emission reduction and advancing diversity and inclusion. In addition, all salaried employs must now include at least one sustainability-related goal in their annual performance plans. Our commitment couldn't be stronger. With our purpose to challenge what's possible for a sustainable world, we are uniquely positioned to solve pressing challenges for our customers. This passion powers us forward to deliver top tier financial performance and differentiated returns for shareholders. Now I would like to turn the call over to Dave to discuss our bookings and revenue performance in the quarter. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks Mike. Please turn to slide number five. We delivered robust organic bookings growth of 31% in the first quarter with growth across all segments and business units. We also delivered strong revenue growth in each segment. Our America segment delivered growth in both bookings and revenue, up 36% and 9% respectively. Our Americas commercial HVAC business has remained resilient since the start of the pandemic, delivering strong Q1 bookings growth of low single digits in the quarter. We are especially pleased with this performance relative to the mid teens growth comp in the first quarter of 2020, making the two-year growth stack for Americas commercial HVAC high teens. Revenues were flat in the quarter, which also represents strong performance relative to the growth in the first quarter of 2020, making the two-year stack, up mid-single digits. Services were up low single digits. The residential HVAC markets remain robust and our residential HVAC team delivered strong revenue growth, well in excess of 30% in the quarter as they once again grew market share. We entered the quarter with a strong backlog and exited the quarter with an even stronger backlog, putting us in a strong position entering Q2. Our Americas transport refrigeration business outperformed the North America truck and trailer markets in the quarter, delivering strong revenue growth, up mid teens and exceptional bookings growth in the quarter. Turning to EMEA. Our teams delivered 18% bookings growth in the quarter with strong growth in both commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration. Revenues were also strong, up 12%. EMEA commercial HVAC bookings were up high single digits and revenues were up mid teens, once again outperforming the market. We continue to see strong demand for our products and services that help reduce the energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions of buildings. EMEA transport bookings were up over 20% in the quarter and revenues were up high single digits, outperforming the broader transport markets. Our Asia-Pacific team delivered bookings growth of 14% and revenue growth of 34% in the quarter, lapping a soft Q1 2020 that was heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. China continues to outperform the rest of Asia where number of economies are still struggling with the impacts of the pandemic and low vaccination rates. Now I would like to turn the call over to Chris to discuss our operating performance and margins. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks Dave. Please turn to slide number six. Dave provided a good overview of our revenues on the prior slide. So I will focus my comments on margins. Adjusted EBITDA margins were strong, up 460 basis points driving adjusted EPS growth of 135%. We delivered strong operating leverage in all regions supported by superior innovation for our customers, strong productivity and cost containment actions. Price cost tailwinds were particularly strong in the first quarter, driven by realization of premium pricing on leading innovation and pricing actions taken to remediate increasing material cost inflation in 2021. In addition, we maintained high levels of business reinvestment in innovation, technology and productivity. Please turn to slide number seven. In the Americas region, market outgrowth, cost containment, productivity and price drove solid EBITDA margin expansion of 400 basis points. Likewise, the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions delivered strong market outgrowth, productivity and cost containment to improve EBITDA margins by 540 basis points and 1,160 basis points respectively versus 2020. Our market outgrowth in each region is supported by relentless investments in superior innovation to help our customers solve their most challenging and complex problems, fueling new product and service offerings. We delivered strong productivity from both our robust pipeline of projects and the structural transformation initiatives that we outlined at our December 2020 investor event. Now I would like to turn the call back over to Dave to provide our market outlook. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks Chris. Please turn to slide number eight. Commercial HVAC Americas has significantly outperformed the broader markets since the beginning of the pandemic through strong focus, agility and execution, combined with relentless innovation across products and services to our customers. Demand remains high for comprehensive indoor air quality solutions and we continue to see indoor air quality as a long term tailwind for our business. End markets are mixed with continued strong data center and warehouse demand. The pipeline for our education end market is also strong. To-date, we have engage with many of our K-12 customers to perform indoor air quality assessments in anticipation of the time when federal stimulus funds will be made available. At this point the full impact and timing of the stimulus remains to be determined but it's clearly a multiyear tailwind for our business, given our strong presence in the education markets and our direct sales force with deep relationships in this vertical. End market indicators are improving with ABI over 50 in both February and March, both positives for the road ahead. In summary, though our visibility into some end market verticals remain somewhat limited due to continued uncertainty related to the pandemic, we continue to see solid prospects for continued underlying market improvements in the second half of 2021, given positive progress and trends related to increased vaccination rates. Turning to residential. We saw a record first quarter bookings and revenue which puts us in a strong backlog position entering the second quarter. Overall, we expect a strong first half and a challenging second half with tough comps in the back half of the year, given record bookings and revenue in the second half of 2020. Turning to Americas transport. We are expecting continued strong growth for the balance of 2021 as markets continue to improve. Orders were very strong in the quarter with many customers placing orders for the year. All in, we expect 26% weighted average market growth for the year, reiterating our prior outlook. Turning to EMEA. The recovery continues to be country dependent with some countries in additional rounds of lockdowns. It's early to call the recovery broadly in Europe, but we expect continued improvement in 2021 with increased vaccination rates in the region. Transport markets in particular are expecting approximately 8% market growth, given the current rate of economic improvement, reiterating our prior outlook. Turning to Asia. We expect continued growth in China in 2021. However, the rest of Asia has been slow to curb the virus and vaccination rates remain low. Overall, we see a mixed picture for Asia in 2021. Now I would like to turn the call back over to Chris to update you on our guidance for 2021. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks Dave. Please turn to slide number nine. Based on our strong first quarter performance our growing backlog and the expectation for an improving pace of global vaccinations, we have raised our full year guidance for both revenues and adjusted EPS for 2021. As Mike indicated earlier, we expect to deliver strong organic financial performance with organic revenue growth of approximately 9%, up from our previous guidance of between 5% and 7%. We expect to deliver strong organic leverage over 35% for the full year with organic leverage of approximately 30% for the balance of the year. We continue to see about 1.5 points of revenue growth from the channel acquisitions we announced last quarter, which will carry about five points of operating margin and deliver EPS accretion of about $0.05. All in, total revenue growth is expected to be approximately 10.5% and adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $6 which translates to approximately 35% earnings growth versus 2020. Our updated guidance reflects both our strong performance in Q1 and an improved outlook for the remainder of the year. We also raised our free cash flow guidance with our increased EPS growth. We expect free cash flow to remain strong at equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net income. If we project current FX rates out to the end of the year, FX would likely be a tailwind, albeit too early to call, given market volatility. Our FX exposure is largely translational and each point of revenue will translate at approximately transitional OI rates. Net, each point from FX would translate into about $0.05 of EPS. Please go to slide number 10. As we outlined during our investor event in December, by transforming Trane Technologies, we initially identified $100 million of fixed cost reductions by 2021. We have exceeded our initial cost reduction expectations, delivering $100 million of savings in 2020, a full year early and we expect to deliver $90 million of incremental savings for a total of $190 million in savings in 2021. We are now targeting and are on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings by 2023. As we outlined in December, we will continue to invest these cost savings to further strengthen our high-performance flywheel which has a reinforcing and compounding effect over time. First, we invest a significant portion of the savings into unrelenting business reinvestments in innovation and leading technology. This fuels the second element, sustained growth above our end markets. Third, we invest another significant portion of the savings in to an improved the cost structure which drives the fourth element, improved and sustainable incremental margins at or above 25% over the mid to long term. When combined, this creates a compounding effect of high-quality earnings growth and free cash flow year after year. Please go to slide number 11. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy that is focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We continue to strengthen our core business with high levels of business reinvestment in high ROI technology, innovation and operational excellence projects which are vital to our continued growth, product leadership and margin expansion. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We have a long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth overtime. We continue to pursue strategic M&A that further improves long term shareholder returns and we continue to see value in share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. All in, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Please turn to slide 12 and I will discuss how we plan to deploy excess cash in 2021. Looking at full year 2021, after fully reinvesting in the business, we plan to continue executing our balanced capital allocation strategy and have increased our capital deployment target to approximately $2.5 billion, a $500 million increase to our prior guidance. We anticipate deploying the additional $500 million between value accretive M&A and share repurchases, taking the total target for M&A and share repurchases to approximately $1.5 billion for the year. In the first quarter, we raised our dividend by 11%, deployed $174 million to M&A and share repurchases and paid down $300 million of debt. We plan to retire an additional $125 million in debt as it reaches maturity in the third quarter of 2021, taking the total debt retirement to $425 million for the year. This guidance increase reflects our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, our commitment to deploying 100% of excess cash over time and our continued confidence in our ability to deliver powerful free cash flow to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy. Now I would like to turn the call back over to Dave and Mike to cover key investor topics of interest and to close with a summary of key points. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks Chris. Please go to slide number 14. We have covered the main points of our guidance earlier in the presentation, so I won't spend a lot of additional time on it now. The objective of this slide is to lay out how to think about organic growth and leverage and the impact of the acquisitions. It also provides some helpful modeling guidance elements outlined on the bottom of the slide. The key takeaways are that we are expecting strong organic growth, leverage and EPS and that M&A adds additional revenues and modest EPS accretion in 2021. Please go to slide number 15. We want to provide an update on transport markets, as we know this is a topic of interest for investors and analysts. The net takeaway is that our outlook for 2021 is largely unchanged from our prior outlook where we highlighted that we expect to see approximately 26% weighted average market growth for transport Americas and approximately 8% weighted average market growth for transport EMEA. While ACT has raised our outlook slightly for our North America trailers about 1%, from 39% growth to 40% growth, they modestly lowered their outlook for truck, which nets out to be a wash on total growth. EMEA is in a similar boat with IHS lowering their 2021 forecast slightly but not enough to shift our view. In total, we have seen very strong demand through the first quarter in both transport markets and we think that ACT and IHS have called the markets about right for 2021, which means transport globally should have a very strong year for us. This is consistent with our prior 2021 view. But I would say, we have greater confidence after our first quarter performance and our growing backlog. The other element I wanted to highlight for transport North America is that ACT has increased their trailer forecast for fiscal year 2022 to 51.1 thousand units, which represents an increase of about 13% over their 2021 forecast. While on the subject, we are occasionally asked about the historical cyclicality in the North America trailer market. Data would suggest the patterns have changed. The North America trailer market took a step-up in 2015 and has been above 40,000 units ever sense with only one exception, 2020. 2020 saw market declines intensified by the pandemic. So I am not sure how informative it is about the future. The driver lodge, driver shortage and added economic activity appears that fundamentally shifted the markets to new levels above 40,000 units, excluding economic disruption. ACT's forecast for 2023 is also at the mid 40,000 unit level. If they are correct in their forecast for 2021 through 2023, it will be a eight of nine years where the North America trailer market has been in the mid 40,000 unit range, plus or minus 10%. Net, 2022 and 2023 are shaping up to be strong years as well. I like to now turn the call back to Mike for closing remarks. Mike? Mike Lamach : Thanks Dave. Please go to slide 16. Energy efficiency and sustainability megatrends are only growing stronger and we are uniquely positioned to deliver leading innovation that intersects with these trends and accelerate the world's progress. And we are not only focused on investments in innovation and growth, but also on investments in our business transformation. We are on track to deliver $300 million in savings that will continue to improve the cost structure of the company and enable additional reinvestment to expand margins and further strengthen our ability to outgrow our end markets. When combined with the long term sustainability megatrends underpinning our end markets, our exceptional ability to generate free cash flow and balanced capital deployment of 100% of excess cash over time, we are well positioned to continue to drive differentiated shareholder returns. I have said that Trane Technologies has the essence of a startup with the credibility of a market leader. That unique profile fosters a culture of inclusion, ingenuity and performance that delivers results as we demonstrated in the first quarter. It's this type of passion and purpose that sets Trane Technologies apart and it's how it will change the industry and ultimately change the world. And now, Chris, Dave and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Mike Lamach : Good morning Jeff. Dave Regnery : Good morning Jeff. Chris Kuehn : Good morning Jeff. Jeff Sprague : I just wondered if you could just dig into kind of the price cost dynamics a little bit. I am not surprised to hear you are nicely ahead of the curve in Q1. Just a little more color on the year. It sounds like you expect to stay positive all year long. But is there any particular point and I am thinking perhaps Q2, where actually you end up on the negative side of this as price is catching up? You are ready to price to catch up, that is? Chris Kuehn : Hi Jeff. This is Chris. I will get started. Thanks for question. So yes, Q1 we did see particularly strong price cost in the quarter. When thinking about our first round of price increases, they went effect is in November and January, really just trying to get ahead of what we saw to be the rising material inflation coming into 2021. With that, that helped drive some really strong price cost in the first quarter. But for the balance of the year, we are really seeing from Q2 to Q4 that price cost about really being flattish. We have announced and put into effect the second round of price increases here in April. But continued material cost inflation has us continue to climb up as well. So we are really seeing the balance of the year that being roughly flat which we continue to manage and monitor where we can. Material inflation, we got our playbook. They were executing well at this time between our copper locks, 70% of that is locked in any point of time. The steel pricing and roughly a six month lag we see in terms of steel pricing. We are still executing the playbook. But I would say, for the balance of the year, we are seeing that really moderating and becoming flattish. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks. Dave Regnery : The other thing I would add to that, Jeff, this is Dave, is that our innovation really helps us with price realization as well. So as we have a really robust pipeline and we keep on executing on our new product launches, it's always nice to go to a customer and tell them about the value that you have created and how this solution could add to their bottomline. Jeff Sprague : And just secondly, Mike, on the strategic angle, you are not interested in raising our capital deployment and obviously the cash flow is there and looks solid. Is your confidence level on finding interesting M&A rising here? I understand if it doesn't materialize you toggle to share repurchase. But just interested in your kind of visibility and confidence level on the M&A front? Mike Lamach : Yes. Jeff, it starts with really confidence in earnings and the ability to turn it into cash. And so it's really the commitment we have had for a long time about deploying cash to shareholders over time. And so the confidence there on $2.5 billion is really that. Further, there is a strong pipeline. We are very, very disciplined about how we look at acquisitions. We still feel the intrinsic value of our own share price offers opportunity. So I am confident that one way or the other, we will split it. But we will be able to spend it. But as I said on the last call, the pipeline is robust and I am sure that we will find some value before the end of the year there. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi and good morning. Mike Lamach : Hi Julian. Julian Mitchell : Maybe I just wanted to clarify on organic sales growth. So you took out the guide for the year, about three points, I think. Maybe just help us understand, it sounds like transport refrigeration there will change, sort of waiting of that commercial versus resi HVAC. And within Americas commercial HVAC, flat sales in Q1. How do you see that playing out from here? Dave Regnery : Yes. Julian, how are you doing? This is Dave. I will start and Mike and Chris could add in. If we just really go around the global, overall we expect a continued market improvements with the increased global vaccination rates in 2021, but at a global level, that is. If you look at Americas commercial HVAC, we will start with, we see a nice demand in data centers and warehouses and we have seen that for a while now. But I would also tell you that the education verticals are also showing strength. So we are pretty happy about that. Hospitality is also still weak. However healthcare is showing some strength. So it's kind of mixed right now, but you have got some leading indicators. ABI is strong, which is a good read for us in the future. One point I would point out in the Americas, if you look at the incoming order rates, we run it with the Americas. So it's North America and Latin America. If you look at just North America, their incoming order rates were up mid single digits where Latin America was actually down mid teens. So we are seeing some strength in our commercial business in the Americas. You go to residential, continued strong bookings, continued strong backlog going into Q2. That's going to be a story of first half or second half. First half will be very strong. Second half, we have some very tough comps that we are going to be facing there. But overall, we are still positive of our residential business. If you look at the full year, the prevailing consensus is that that would be up in the mid single digits. And we have no reason to disagree with that. Transport, I talked about. It's going to be a strong year. And the nice thing about that is, if you look out into 2022 and 2023 forecast, that strength continues, which is a good sign. EMEA, it's really dependent. We still are seeing some lockdowns occurring. But we are seeing nice results there with our innovation and really around our heat pump, especially in the commercial business with our heat pump solutions that are really making a benefit to our customers. EMEA is another one you have got to break that down. If you look at Europe, our incoming order rates in Europe were up mid teens and actually our incoming order rates in the Middle East were down mid single digits. Asia-Pacific showing strength in China for sure. Data centers, electronics, pharma, healthcare, nice strength there. Rest of Asia has been slow, right. And we are hopeful that vaccine, can start to pick up their vaccine distribution rates and that it could bounce back. But if you look at the first quarter incoming order rates for the rest of Asia were actually down in the mid single digit range. So a lot of strength there in China. So hopefully, that helps you with seeing what we are seeing for the outlook. Julian Mitchell : Yes. That's perfect. Thank you Dave. And then maybe a broader question around that commercial HVAC business, sort of equipment versus service. I understand there is a push to do a lot more contractual type service to keep the attachment rates high, trying to deliver to customers who sold for that sort of IAQ versus energy efficiency conundrum. Maybe help us understand where Trane is on that service push within commercial HVAC and what the uptake is from customers for any kind of newer service offerings? Dave Regnery : Yes. We continue to see strength in our service business. It was up low single digits. Attachment rates, very high on the applied systems side. Indoor air quality, continue to see tailwinds there. The neat thing about indoor air quality is not only are we seeing indoor air quality audits being conducted in the education vertical, we are also seeing an uptick in the offices. Vaccines are being distributed and people are thinking about getting back to the office. We are seeing a nice uptick in our office inquiries and actually the activity. As far as your question about like indoor air quality and energy efficiency in buildings, I think you are aware, we do a very comprehensive audit. We have the day one which islets make sure the building is safe as possible today. Day two, let's do long term infrastructure improvements that you could make to not only make your building healthier, but also to reduce the energy intensity of your building. And we are seeing a lot of traction with those audits and w are starting to see the day two activity come through, especially that combined with some of the stimulus funding that's starting to flow in this education vertical. Mike Lamach : Julian, I would add a little bit by saying, we had a view that we thought would be a tailwind, 1% to 2%, with IAQ going forward. That's turning out to be right in last quarter and this quarter and it's near to the top of the pipeline and for the balance of the year. It's been pushing towards a 2% end of that range versus the 1% of that range. Over time, it's going to be difficult to necessarily parse that out as you get more design and more standards being written in a way that that's written in as opposed to a retrofit. But for now, we are seeing that pan out to be 1% to 2%, kind of trending closer to the 2%, which gets to the question as well about what's different and what's changed, an example of why is North America commercial a little bit better. It's because we are seeing strong uptick on the offerings that we have got. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi guys. Good morning. Mike Lamach : Good morning Steve. Dave Regnery : Good morning Steve. Chris Kuehn : Good morning Steve. Steve Tusa : Just to follow up on that. I mean, you guys had highlighted, I think, last year that you did have an Americas weakness in services and parts impacted due to lockdowns. I would have thought the comp was a bit easier and you were going pretty nicely in the second half of last year. So up low single digits on that side of the house. And carrier, I think, put up double-digit growth or something in services. Anything going on there with regards to timing? Or is this just kind of -- can this business be lumpy? I had thought of it as being a little bit more consistent? Dave Regnery : Yes. Steve, I think quarter one last year, you didn't really have at point in time service lockdowns and the complete absence of being able to service buildings physically. That really occurred quarter two and on. As I recall, it was pretty strong. Mike Lamach : It was strong in Q1. Dave Regnery : Yes. Strong in quarter one as well. I would say, around the world, as buildings were closed and you are delivering more digital services than physical services. So that changed. And you are seeing just a constant drumbeat towards more and more of the openings with the exception of important economies like India and Brazil, parts of Europe, as an example. Some parts of the Middle East. But it's a healthy recovery. It was a good sign for us to see growth in quarter, quarter one and service again really continuing along that pattern. And it doesn't appear that we are really going to see any fallout from a contractual basis at this point relative to our service base, which is the other thing you worry about when you see the economy stamping back and we seem to be renewing those relationships in those contractual agreements in an effective way. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then just to clarify the follow-up. I didn't quite get the answer to Julian's question on what precisely you are raising the guidance around? What revenue source? Just simply, you are raising the guidance around? And then just one nitpick, will be positive in that 20 to 30 basis points range this year all-in on price cost? Or will it end up being kind of a normal year on price cost spread? Thanks. Mike Lamach : Steve, I will take it. So for the full year revenue increase, call it, three points, we had a strong first quarter. So we are passing that on to the full year. We have got price increases to cover material inflation. That's being baked into the guide. And we are still HVAC predominantly company, right. The first quarter is kind of our lightest quarter of the year. So we have got some visibility into the second and some optimism around the second half of the year. So that's ultimately is driving the three point increase we are seeing on revenues right now, the Q1 beat pricing from actions here to control material inflation and then a little bit more optimism we are seeing in the second half. Your other question was on price cost. Yes, I think we expect that spread is going to narrow and we expect it will be flattish. Could it be net positive, 20, 30 basis points in the full year? It could be. But this is a volatile area, as we know. We are monitoring and tracking material inflation. And I wouldn't roll it off the table if we needed to another set of price increases depending on where that goes. But it could be net positive. But it would be kind of in that very low 20, 30 basis point range to flattish on the full year. Steve Tusa : Great. Thanks for the details. Mike Lamach : You got it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hi. Good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Good morning Andy. Dave Regnery : Good morning Andy. Chris Kuehn : Good morning Andy. Andy Kaplowitz : Mike, so I know we aren't even halfway through the year and likely still in the early in the transport up-cycle. But as you know, many investors get concerned regarding the cyclicality of the business. And you just talked about the strength that could last into 2022 and 2023. So maybe you could talk about the durability of the strength you are seeing now? How much of the underlying trends that we are seeing last mile, cold storage, maybe more significant China-related growth are helping you. So as you go out into the out years, there still could be good demand in that business? Mike Lamach : Yes. Thanks Andy. I will let Dave start that out and I can put a little color on the back-end, maybe. Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, for sure, the trailer demand in North America, as I said earlier, I think there's a new tipping point there. It's 40,000 units, eight over the last nine years. So this is no longer a business that's going to dip down at least in North America into the 20s range. Thermo King is a very diverse business right now. So we are very happy with the growth rates we are seeing in trailer not only in the Americas but also in Europe. But because of our diversification, we are seeing growth in other areas as well, especially on the electric side with home delivery. We are very excited about some of the new products we have been able to develop there that are in the market today and more to come. And we are also this whole refrigerated container solution, really helping with the vaccine distribution and storage capability. And as vaccines now supply is starting to outpace demand, these vaccines, especially the mRNA ones need a place to be stored. And we have solutions for that on a global basis. And we are certainly helping out in areas like India working with the World Health Organization to make sure that they have the products that are required to make sure that they can get as many people vaccinated as possible. Mike Lamach : Yes. Andy, the volatility always seems to come in the booking area, not so much on the revenue side of this thing, as we look at the heartbeat of our operations and units, it stays fairly constant. We don't get the volatility from a revenue perspective. And Dave's points are exactly on. I think what you are seeing here with some of the larger trailer customers, particularly in the U.S. would be looking out over a year and getting their orders in over the period of a year. So maybe that's a little bit different. Although the larger customers tend to give you an indication of what they are going to do for the year. Here, I think we have got a customer just lining up for firm orders earlier in the year. Andy Kaplowitz : Mike, that's helpful. And then recently, you suggested that your opportunity for the electrification of heat could be $2 billion versus we initially thought a $1 billion opportunity in Europe and China, maybe even you U.S. But maybe you can give more color, how much for instance of your EMEA revenue at this point is heat pumps? And how fast is it growing? And what are you thinking in terms of growth this year? And what kind of opportunity could be in China or the U.S. over time? Dave Regnery : Yes. When you say electrification of heat and heat pump, Canada became the poster child for that because it's an easy concept for people to understand. These are complex systems that really are combined boiler plant and chiller plant into a single unit which is capable of doing air-to-air or air-to-water, you know any combination you can think of using heat sources that would move from sewage to seawater to lake water to you name it. And so we are seeing this applied both on a building level, even on a city level. And we are seeing great wins there. Mike Lamach : It is, by far, the fastest growing part of our business. And I believe it's going to be a meaningful part. It is a meaningful part of business today. It's going to continue to be a meaningful part. So yes, I think it's at least a couple billion dollar opportunity globally. It's centered right now primarily in Western Europe. We are seeing some implementation in parts of China. And we think that there is further opportunity, commercial opportunity, moving into the colder North American climate. So over time, it just seems to creep further and further north, not just because the temperatures are getting warmer but also the technology is getting better to be able to work with lower ambient temperatures or hot ambient temperatures and make it work in the reverse cycle. So very positive on that. Dave, you want to add any color? Dave Regnery : So I mean the only thing I would add, Andy, is just it's, as Mike said, today 95% of buildings operate with two silos, right. The cooling side would be the chiller plant and the heating side the boiler plant. But by combining them, you are really able to have an impact on efficiency. A conventional system has a, what we call, total energy ratio of two, meaning that every unit of energy that goes in, you have two coming out. When you are able to combine these two with our heat pump technology and our sophisticated controls and I won't go into detail for competitive reasons, but we are able to get total energy ratios of like four times conventional systems. So the value prop to our customers is very, very creative for them. And the value to the environment, these are very, very green solutions. So this is big market today for us in Europe and it's expanding very quickly. Mike Lamach : The discussion today, it's happening in California, in North California. It's happening all over the world. And I think this is going to be a very important global strategy for net zero emissions in buildings, would be using the electrification of heat, with the absence of fossil fuel boilers. And the more you can green the grid, as they are doing particularly in Europe, you are going to get to a net zero solution on day one. And as we put sort of the next generation refrigerants into these systems, we are offering complete net zero solutions when there's sustainable power coming off the grid. Andy Kaplowitz : Very interesting, guys I appreciate the color. Mike Lamach : Thanks Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning everyone. Mike Lamach : Good morning John. Dave Regnery : Good morning John. Chris Kuehn : Good morning John. John Walsh : Hi. So I was just wondering, obviously you gave us the help on the incrementals. We have really unusual comp coming here in Q2. How would you think about the business? Should we think about kind of sequential growth rates? Just I mean you talked earlier about the two-year growth stack. So you could even argue go back three years. Next quarter's even easier for you. But how would you help us think about what kind of lift we should see here in the second quarter? Chris Kuehn : Hi John. It's Chris. Yes. I think about the second quarter where organic revenues are probably around that mid teens range. When you add in acquisitions, they are driving about a 1.5 of growth for us for the year and that's continuing. We saw that in Q1 and we will see that again in Q2. When we stack organic and acquisitions together, we are probably in the mid to high teens range of revenue growth. And then we are expecting that continued strong organic leverage. We would expect about 30% leverage here in the in the second quarter. When you factor in the acquisitions, it's probably high 20s on a reported basis for leverage. So that's how we are kind of thinking about the second quarter right now. Still a little early to call the third and fourth quarter. Again, second quarter would be a big quarter for us as HVAC business but hopefully that gives you are little bit of context around how we are thinking the second quarter can shape up. John Walsh : Yes. Thank you for that. And then, I think there's obviously a lot of funding right and excitement around not just K-12 as you highlighted but it's broadening. Is there anything else you look forward because of supply chain or labor that would kind of govern the growth? Or anything that would slow down the pace of being able to do these energy efficiency and IAQ. kind of retrofits? Dave Regnery : Yes. John, I will start on the supply chain. I would tell you that we have a pretty robust process managing our supply chain. We have very detail roadmaps we developed early on during the pandemic. And we continue to execute to those. So I won't say it's easy because it's not. But I would tell you, our team is doing a great job of managing through any kind of constraints to make sure that we have the proper components so that we could manufacture our products and meet our customer's demand. So as far as the labor, I think was your second one. Again, yes, it's tight but we are managing through and we have some great processes in place that allow us to do that. Mike Lamach : Yes. John, I think from our own internal labor perspective, we are fine. I think when you think about sort of the broader context of skilled trades doing large construction and infrastructure work, particularly in the U.S., if we were to pass a major infrastructure plan in the U.S., you tend to have less skilled trades people come back in after every downturn in the economy. We saw that in the 2008, 2009 time frame and it had the fact of taking institutional projects cycles out a bit longer to get them completed. And my sense is, you could se the same thing here which frankly in our world, it's fine. It's just really extends the new construction or retrofit portion of institutional construction, it extends that a little further. John Walsh : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Passing along. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi. Good morning guys. Mike Lamach : Good morning Josh. Dave Regnery : Good morning Josh. Chris Kuehn : Good morning Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just a question on some of this IAQ assessment and day one versus day one plus another number? I guess how much are you guys able to do upfront in sort of a timely manner as these customers want to reopen versus stuff that might wade into 2022 or even later just as the function of kind of natural bottlenecks in the process? Like, is this something that lasts two to three years with maybe more on the backend? Or is more of the activity front-end loaded? Just thinking about folks who want to get into offices basically right now who might need to do something a bit more comprehensive, clearly there's going to be some sort of band-aid approach in the short term? Mike Lamach : Yes. Josh, when you think about non-commercial construction and you think about the 400 billion square feet of space around the world and you are going to see around people trying to figure this stuff out. And when you think about our portfolio of hundreds of thousands of customers that need help, if not more than a million that we have, it's very difficult to average this and so we always kind of think about things more on archetypes. You have got institutional customers that are critical to making the economy work. Think about healthcare, think about education. If there are healthy healthcare systems and there are healthy school districts or universities, they are going to move quicker. Healthy meaning, if property taxes or tax or bonds could be passed that may help to some extent. In other extent, if there would be stimulus that would be available to K-12 and higher education, that's going to help people in terms of progress. But it's very, very difficult. You could think about movie theaters, right. A year ago, six months ago, right, there wasn't really anything happening in terms of any investment going on in movie theaters. But as you think about those opening up, you are going to find that something like that. large retail complexes, retail malls are going to need to reengage with this stuff. There is no averages here. It really comes down to some archetypes between maybe institutional, healthy versus unhealthy commercial, perhaps markets that are healthy would be data centers, warehousing versus those that are going to be challenged which might be retail mall complexes in some regard to light commercial which you are seeing higher vacancies there. No averages there. But what we do have is a very good set of pipeline management tools and analytics that go into building pipelines from the ground up, from individual sales people in the field. And so there's a strong sense about what's in the pipeline and what the win rates, close rates might look like and the timeline there, which is what gives us some confidence to have some visibility through this. But it's not through averaging. And even the Dodge data, frankly, disconnects from our own data because of that, part of it because only 15% of our revenues can be explained through Dodge data and partly because we have got really good data coming through with the entire global sales force using more sophisticated pipeline tools to give us the actual details around pipeline and orders. Long winded answer to your question, there is no averages. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then as you just think about the mix of business today and maybe 1Q because the hot season was not the best example. But is this still sort of you know kind of post crisis management where folks are catching up on the late activity or want to talk about indoor air quality? Or are we sort of back to the normal business of replacing things that are at the end of life, doing energy retrofits, kind of the core HVAC businesses we have known over time. Thanks. Mike Lamach : You are perhaps on the front-end of latter part which is some return to normalcy in some parts of the world, some parts of the economy, frankly. But largely, we are still very, very focused on the indoor air quality constraints, getting people to open safely, figuring out where investment dollars from our customer should be spent with regard to the facilities. And so really early innings, frankly, around reopening, in my mind. Dave Regnery : No, I totally agree. And that's why I made the comment earlier about office vertical. We are now starting to see a lot of activity there where six, nine months ago, we weren't saying a lot of indoor air quality audits there. But as people now are realizing that hopefully we could all get back to the office relatively soon, they need to start thinking about reopening. So that's driving a lot of demand there. Mike Lamach : Yes. Six to nine months, Josh, we would have been advising our customers on the kinds of technologies and things that they could do, really educating the marketplace largely on what the potential strategies could be versus actually the commercial office space now getting in and helping them execute those audits and those plans. So it's moved from conceptual, what do I do, to specifically, what am I going to do open this facility and building. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Thanks for the color. Good luck guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hi. Good morning and I will echo some of that congrats on great start to the year. Mike Lamach : Thank you Scott. Dave Regnery : Thank you Scott. Chris Kuehn : Thank you Scott. Scott Davis : I guess when you see this kind of growth, it begs the question of, at what point do you have to take CapEx up to another level? And perhaps a better question to ask really is what kind of growth can you handle without spending money, meaning after all these years of implementing Lean and being such a productive company overall that has -- can productivity, I think, which kind of probably suffered a little bit during COVID, the high times of COVID, but can productivity step up and help deliver the kind of unit volume that perhaps prevents you from having to spend a ton of capital on the backside of this? Mike Lamach : Scott, what I love about Lean is, it never stops. The old adage, you don't have to be bad to get better, really applies. One of my favorite stories was in our Tyler operations in residential, where we had the roof collapse on a part of the production system there. Team goes to work. You are working weekends and mornings and nights and shifts. And comes back with adding 20% capacity to a smaller footprint. And it's the sense of really challenging impossible. We say it around the company, it's true. And I don't see it. We are looking at scenarios. Obviously, TK is one where we are seeing a strong snapback in orders. But we have got playbooks built for different volumes in a lot of our facilities, still the opportunity to run a third shift or a weekend. So we have got a lot of capacity, theoretical capacity that can be turned into actual capacity very quickly. So I do not see the need for us to add for the sake of handling demand. I do think there is an effort that we are taking on to think about resiliency differently inside the company. And you could think about that in the context of climate change and other risks that would be involved with all companies. But where do we need to have resiliency in the supply chain or additional resiliency in our own manufacturing operations. So that resiliency would be more of what we are looking at versus pure capacity. Scott Davis : That makes a lot of sense and it's encouraging. And actually, you touched on what my follow-up question was going to be that a lot of companies, including Trane, are out there with emission targets and other kind of ESG commentary, which is great, but not always a lot of details around it. And just high-level, because this is probably an entire day conversation overall, but how do you get to zero emissions? I mean what's the playbook of when you think about, I mean you already run pretty efficient productive factories. They need electricity. You can't move to all solar overnight. How do you get there? And does it require spending money? Is it iterative and just takes time? Are they step change things? I mean, again, relatively high-level due to time. Mike Lamach : Yes. Scott, you are right. It would take a day and this is what our passion is. What I would tell you as an initial step, would be to ask investors to go to our website and look at our just published ESG report. It's about 100 pages long. But there's short ways to kind of recap and go through it. Get a sense for the totality of what we are doing and the metrics. And you will find a tremendous amount of transparency there about sort of where we are and where we are going. So it lays out that roadmap specifically that you are asking. And so we are really excited about this and we think that as investors kind of dig into that, you will get an absolute sense for the answer to your question. So the ESG report just published on our website, please take a read. Scott Davis : I can't wait to read it. Dave Regnery : Thank you. Scott Davis : Kind of joking. I will definitely read it. But there maybe a peer or two involved in the process. Mike Lamach : Fair enough. Scott Davis : I will pass it along, guys. Good luck. Mike Lamach : All right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Yes. Thanks. I can well imagine Scott going through 100 pages of that ESG report up here. So thanks for the question. So on residential, we haven't spent a lot of time talking about that. It's obviously very strong trends. We have heard several channel partners and several of your competitors talking about, with stimulus dollars in pockets, how some equipment is being replaced as opposed to maybe repaired in normal times. Do you think the strength we are seeing today because of stimulus, et cetera, is taking some demand out of 2022 and maybe 2023 into this year? Any thoughts on that repair versus replace cycle? Mike Lamach : Yes. I will start. I mean we had a very strong quarter, obviously for res. And I would tell you that, not to talk too much about Q2, but that April was another strong month as we thought it would be. I don't believe that it's taking out of the future. I think people are working from home. They realize that being in a comfortable environment is important. We are seeing an uptick in the SEERs that we are selling. So people are going for the higher SEER product. We don't see that really, really pulling ahead, if that's where your question is, demand from 2022 and 2023. Dave Regnery : Yes. I think you see a lot of sort of optimism at this point, economic optimism out there. You are finding, I think, as you look at unemployment rates going down and really reaching, at some point, probably again at a very low level. And you compound that with this whole future of work that we are looking at and we have talked about it in the past, even in our own company. You are finding people with jobs and the likelihood of having a job with increased home values, with the notion that they are going to be spending more time at home. So again, I think this is just really an upgrade cycle phenomenon based on what we are seeing with COVID. But I don't really see it changing and pulling forward replacement. I think people are just opting right now to replace with whole systems to higher SEER systems. And I think that as you get into 2023 and some of those out years, you are going to find, I am sure we will see another change in regulations there and it's going to drive again more toward full system replacements with more expensive and more efficient systems. So I think it will be a good business, probably a GDP-plus business over the long run, possibly when you see regulations really impacting that as they have over the last decade. Mike Lamach : Yes. And just to clarify too, you got to look at them in years, right. You can't really look at first half last year because it was really low and then the second half last year was really strong. In totality, low single digits to mid single digits is kind of the range that it's been in. So the swings happened really by the quarters which were driven by the pandemic. Nigel Coe : Right. And then a follow-up on M&A. We just saw for Melrose sell their HVAC business for, I think, 11, 12 times EBITDA. I mean theoretically, that would have been a very sort of down the middle acquisition to you at very accretive rates, et cetera, et cetera. How should we think about philosophically where you are looking for M&A? Are you looking at future trends, electrification, software digitalization, et cetera? I mean how should we think about where you may land on your M&A strategy? Mike Lamach : Well, first of all, Simon and the Melrose team did a great job with that business. It's a bit of parts that would have ranged from bathroom exhaust fans and kitchen hoods, all the way through to some interesting data center technology. So obviously, that's something that we would have looked at very closely and done our homework around that. Ultimately, it's part of that business which would have made great sense for us and parts of the business which really wouldn't have made sense for us. So I think that's indicative of just staying disciplined around the process and kind of what we pay for things. But yes, I think the pipeline is robust. I mean, again, 88%-plus of what we look at is strategic in nature, meaning it's something that would have been discussed in our strategies before it becomes something that shows up on an M&A screen. There's always 20% of the ideas that are out there that come from different sources and people. We don't think of every good idea nor do we want to. So we look at those as well. So obviously, the activity is high, valuations are relatively high and we are just going to be selective through that, Nigel. And my hope is we can lean further into it and find the right deals for us. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks Mike. Thanks Dave. Mike Lamach : Thanks Nigel. Dave Regnery : Thanks Nigel. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Hi. Good morning everybody. Dave Regnery : Hi Joe. Mike Lamach : Good morning Joe. Chris Kuehn : Good morning Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hi. Mike, maybe just following on Nigel's question there. You know the pipeline is robust. You also had JCI announced the acquisition of Silent-Aire to get bigger on the data center part. When you think about your portfolio, are there any pieces of the portfolio or end markets where you feel like you need to get bigger to get after the opportunity, whether it's in data centers or warehousing? And I know you have been very enthusiastic around the heat pump opportunity. Mike Lamach : Yes. Joe, thanks for the follow-up because that's part of the dilemma. The answer is no. There's not any gaps in the portfolio. There's nothing strategically that we feel is lacking. And so there's a more discerning eye spent on it. And of course, we don't want to do M&A for the sake of M&A. I think that could be value destructive. So the answer is no. So therefore, we found novel technologies that just need some scale and a home to develop them or we found potentially bringing inside the channel partners that we may not have been running the service business and therefore, we can do an effective job running the service business and with our systems. So those have been what we have seen. Again, we are looking at both channel and some of the technologies that are out there, but some of the scale here can be smaller. Interestingly, I think through the pandemic, I always talk about sort of the largest four HVAC companies and then kind of players five through 15. I do think that there could be consolidation still in five through 15. But one of the things I think we are realizing through the downturn is it's a much heavier concentration through the pandemic of the top four. And I think it makes a lot of that merger potential and opportunity that's here. I think it's more restrictive. I think it certainly has got more hurdles to clear. So you could find value in some of the more sizable company, sort of, five through 15 or five through 80, because they actually go that far, if you incorporate some of the Western European, which is very fragmented. There's some players there that they get fairly small. But those are the opportunities, I think, that might be of scale for us. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's super helpful, Mike. And maybe just a follow-on question. There's been some discussion already around price cost. It seems like you are managing it really well this year and we are in a pretty tough inflationary environment. What do you think is different for you guys this time around versus maybe what we saw like the 2017, 2018 time frame and your ability to really manage through this well? Mike Lamach : One thing is, really, if we go back now really 10 years, the one thing I can tell you is that operating system is not different. And so we really had great success over long period of time in doing that. But the difference back in that really volatile 2016, 2017 time period was that it became very speculative in areas like copper. And it was something that it was very difficult to really understand the veracity at which it was changing and the speed it was changing. Here, the visibility towards the changes have been little bit easier for us to recognize and see and a little bit more capability switching between some of the commodities. Copper and aluminum has helped us over time kind of mitigate some of that as well. So the systems have not changed. The topline, margin expansion, operating system fundamentals in the company are exactly the same, just a bit more predictable in the rate of change here versus the volatility of the last one. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Dan Flick : Hi guys. This is Dan Flick, on for Gautam. Thanks for getting me on. Dave Regnery : Hi Dan. Dan Flick : So just one question here. I was hoping you could explain some of the moving pieces on the operating leverage target for the remainder of the year coming down to 30%, which was so strong in Q1? And whether is that related to absolute R&D dollars coming up? Or is it all COGS? Any pieces on that would be helpful. Chris Kuehn : Hi Dan. This is Chris. Yes, we had strong leverage in the first quarter. But as we think about the balance of the year, we are still targeting 30% operating leverage, consistent with our prior guide. For us, when I think about the performance flywheel we have within the company, let me start off with the first step and the first step is really reinvesting. We fully expect to have stronger investments, Q2 to Q4. We had strong investments in the first quarter. But those are really going to ramp up as we move throughout the year as well. We have talked a bit about the innovation pipeline where we are seeing new product development. All of that combined would really materialize in a strong step-up in investments for Q2 to Q4. Second, that price cost spread is going to narrow. So we are going to see price, but we are going to see cost roughly approximating price, Q2 to Q4. So those pricing increases don't bring a lot of leverage with that, of course. So that's going to be a headwind versus where we were in the first quarter. And then ultimately, we are still managing through the return of some temporary cost takeouts from last year. That was part of our guide three months ago for 30% organic leverage. It's still part of our guide today. So all in, 30% for the balance of the year and we raised the full year to 35%, just given where we stood in the first quarter Dan Flick : Cool. That's helpful. Thank you. Chris Kuehn : No problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Andrew Krill : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. This is Andrew Krill, on for Deane. I wanted to go back to resi HVAC. And can you give a sense of sell-through you saw in the first quarter with distribution? Just was that close to the plus 30% you cited for yourself and for sales? And then, can you just give us a sense on how you see inventories heading into the peak selling season? Thanks. Dave Regnery : Yes. This is Dave. I will start. I think most of you know our resi business, think of it as 50/50. 50, were direct. 50, we sell through the independent wholesale distributor channel. On the IWD side, we saw the sell-through was strong, okay, in the 20s. So we saw some strength there. Obviously the sell-in was stronger than that, as they filled some of their barns and their inventory. We are not seeing a significant build in their inventory levels from the visibility that we have. We have some pretty good visibility there. So it was just a solid quarter for our resi business. Our teams performed well. They executed to customer demands and we fulfilled and hopefully made a lot of homes more comfortable. Mike Lamach : Yes. The data that I saw, I think, it might have been like, were three months. Let's just use that. I think it's pretty close to being what you think would be sort of a run of the mill inventory level would be. It might be 3.5 months. So there might be two weeks, which I think is prudent basis where we were last year and some of the underestimation that distribution had. So it's marginally increased, but not enough where any flags would be raised. Andrew Krill : Got it. It makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up. We are going into overtime a little. But just cash flow in the first quarter looks very strong, a lot of times actually used. Just anything you would spike out there and then any other big moving parts to be aware of as the year progresses? Thanks. Chris Kuehn : Yes. This is Chris. No, we are happy with first quarter performance. I think it was 96% free cash flow conversion to earnings. So high-quality earnings there. I would say, we continued to make structural improvements around our working capital where, I think it was around 1.5% at the end of the first quarter. I think a mid to long term target for us is going to be a little bit higher than that and we are going to modestly invest in inventory here through the year. But our days sales have improved from two years ago. Our days payable have improved from two years ago. And even inventory turns over the last two years have improved. So we continue to make, from an operational excellence perspective, improvements in working capital. And really, you are seeing that play out here in the first quarter. Full year, we are still guiding to greater than or equal to 100% of net earnings, cash flow and 100% in net earnings. So I think we have got the structural ability to really hit those numbers, if not, slightly exceed for the year. Andrew Krill : Thank you. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Zac Nagle for closing comments. Zac Nagle : I would like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. As always, Shane and I will be available for today and for the coming days to answer any questions that you have and we certainly look forward to connecting. Be safe and we will talk soon. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac Nagle : Thanks operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you\u2019ll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide two. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today\u2019s call are David Regnery, CEO; Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Mike Lamach, Executive Chair and former CEO. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave. Mike? David Regnery : Thanks Zac. Before we jump in, I want to take a moment to recognize Mike Lamach. Mike has reinvented this company a couple of times over. He built our high-performance culture and incredibly strong team. I'm proud to have worked with Mike in his capacity as CEO and I'm looking forward to continue to work with him in his role as Executive Chair until his retirement in the first half of 2022. And now I'd like to turn it over to Mike for a few words. Mike? Mike Lamach : Thank you so much, Dave. After we announced Dave as my successor, I appreciate that we're able to connect with a large number of analysts and investors. First, I want to personally thank everyone for the kind words and e-mails and letters. I'm thankful for the opportunity I've had to work with such a great group of people. In fact, today is a bit of a milestone, marks my 50th and final earnings call. Second, I want to share how excited I am to have Dave leading Trane Technologies. As a retiring CEO, in my view, you only hope for two things. The first is that you're leaving things a little better than when you started; and secondly, that you have complete confidence and trust in your successor. And I have absolute confidence in Dave, having worked closely with him for 18 years and spending the last several years co-architecting our strategy together. I'm extremely proud of what we've accomplished, and I believe we have tremendous opportunity ahead as a climate-focused sustainability leader. Now, back over to you, Dave. David Regnery : Thanks Mike and thanks to everyone for joining us on today's call. I've played an active role on these calls in the past several quarters, but this is my first official call as CEO. I'd also like to thank the long list of shareholders and analysts who have had the pleasure of speaking with right after the announcement. As Mike and I highlighted on those calls, this transition in leadership is an evolution, not a revolution. We co-created the Trane Technologies strategy and have worked closely together for many years. Please turn to slide three. While the world has contended with unprecedented change over the past 18 months and continues to face significant challenges, our purpose-driven sustainability strategy remains steadfast. The long-term sustainability megatrends that underpin our strategy have only intensified and our innovation leadership is transforming the climate industry, as the world decarbonizes. This is more critical every day, as the clock is ticking on climate change. Our aggressive goals and bold actions can dramatically reduce carbon emissions and accelerate the world's progress. In addition, we are proactively addressing emerging trends, as we see heightened focus on indoor air quality, energy efficiency, cold chain and the need to upgrade aging infrastructure in our schools. We are committed to making a difference consistently, relentlessly and over the long term. This unyielding approach drives market outgrowth over the long term, which in turn, helps us drive strong margin and powerful free cash flow to deploy through our balanced capital allocation strategy. The end result is more value across the board for our customers, for our team, for our shareholders and for the planet. Moving to slide number four. After posting a very strong first quarter, we have significantly raised our 2021 guidance range to reflect top quartile EPS growth for full year 2021. The raise reflected both a positive demand outlook and expected acceleration in global vaccination rates. Through the first half of the year, demand is shaping up consistent with our high expectations, while the delta and other coronavirus variants continue to pose considerable risk, large portions of the global economy are rebounding and continue to gradually improve. Our global teams delivered a strong second quarter, with robust organic bookings growth of 30%, driving backlog to a record high. Backlog is up 15% from record Q1 levels and up more than 50% from the end of 2020. It's also up more than 50% versus any quarter in 2019. Net, our backlog is extremely strong, not only in the context of a modestly down 2020, but also in the context of strong financial performance in 2019. Demand for our innovative products and services is high and our record bookings and backlog provide good visibility into 2021 and 2022. Performance was strong throughout the P&L, with organic revenue up 18%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were up 180 basis points on 30% organic leverage and adjusted EPS growth was up more than 50%. In many ways, 2021 is shaping up largely as we anticipated on our Q1 earnings call. So I thought it would be constructive to take a few minutes and talk about what has changed and how that's affecting our approach to the second half of 2021. There are two areas that are making operating environment substantially more challenging. The first is the speed and slope of material and other inflation that has risen dramatically. You'll recall that we saw unprecedented inflation and tariffs impact in the 2017 to 2018 time frame. However, if 2021 plays out as we currently expect, we'll far exceed the peak inflation in tariff numbers we faced during that time frame. In 2021, not only are we seeing higher material cost inflation. Trane Technologies, and from what we're seeing in the market, the entire industry are implementing price changes faster and with far less lag time than in 2017 to 2018. The net result for us is we are implementing about $150 million of incremental pricing in the second half of 2021 to offset about $150 million in incremental inflation. To be clear, this is $150 million above and beyond what was already baked into our guidance at the end of Q1 in both cost and price. Successfully executing the price action offsets otherwise negative EBITDA impacts, but also drives organic leverage on our incremental revenues lower in the second half of the year. However, our industry typically holds on to price. So long-term, we expect these actions to be a solid tailwind for our business. The second thing that has changed is the strong economic environment, combined with other factors such as strained logistics systems and tight labor markets have further stressed already tight supply chains. This is resulting in higher cost and greater inefficiency throughout the value chain. We are fully leveraging our high-performance business operating system and transformation initiatives to manage and mitigate these impacts and meet the needs of our customers. But there is no silver bullet. We believe we can limit the impact of these inefficiencies to a few points of leverage in the back half of the year as we work to meet our customers' expectations and strong demand. Our multiyear track record of delivering high-quality earnings and free cash flow fuels our balanced capital allocation strategy. Year-to-date, we've deployed about half the cash we expect to deploy in 2021. We have a solid pipeline of M&A prospects and continue to see value in our shares. Longer term, our purpose driven sustainability strategy continues to be focused on secular mega-trends that are powerful tailwinds for our business and support continued top-tier performance and differentiated returns for shareholders. Please turn to slide number 5. We delivered robust organic bookings and revenue growth in the quarter, up 30% and 18%, respectively, with growth across all segments and business units. Our Americas Commercial HVAC business delivered robust growth in the quarter. Unlike many other peers and industrials who entered the quarter with easy growth comps after being down significantly in 2020, Americas Commercial HVAC organic bookings were up mid-20s and revenues were up low-teens in Q2 of 2021, building on mid single-digit declines in the prior year. The Residential HVAC markets continue to be extremely strong, and our Residential HVAC team delivered high 30s bookings growth, with independent distributor sell-through up high 20s. We entered the second half of the year with record backlog, up significantly from record backlog at the end of the first quarter. Our Americas Transport Refrigeration business continues to outperform the North American transport markets, delivering more than 30% revenue growth this quarter. Transport bookings were up low single digits, which may look like a miss, but actually it's a positive story and simply reflects a natural pause in orders from substantial bookings growth in Q1 as industry trailer production has largely maxed out capacity for 2021, and the focus has turned to booking slots for 2022. We only recently opened up the order book for our first quarter of 2022, prudently keeping an eye on inflation, looking several months out. It's also worth noting that this quarter's bookings build upon very strong prior year truck and trailers, where bookings were up nearly 50%. Turning to EMEA, our teams delivered 53% bookings growth in the quarter, with strong growth in both Commercial HVAC and Transport Refrigeration. Revenues were also strong, up 28%. We continue to see strong demand for our innovative products and services that helped reduce the energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for our customers. Our Asia Pacific team delivered bookings growth of 12% and revenue growth of 2% in the quarter, with growth in both Commercial HVAC and Transport. The impacts of COVID-19 pandemic continue to be challenged in the region, with low vaccination rates and partial lockdowns in some countries. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number 6. We drove strong adjusted EBITDA and operating margin expansion, supported by strong organic leverage of 30%, despite increasing headwinds as we move through Q2. Combined with strong revenue growth, we delivered outstanding adjusted EPS growth of 51%. In addition, we increased business reinvestment in innovation, technology and productivity initiatives in the quarter. As Dave outlined at the beginning of the call, we're relentless when it comes to innovation to advance our proven sustainability strategy and fuel our growth. Please turn to Slide number 7. In the Americas and EMEA, volume growth, transformation savings, productivity and price realization drove strong EBITDA margin expansion of 170 basis points and 460 basis points, respectively. Asia Pacific's margins declined modestly, but remained at strong levels, and we continue to be very pleased with the progress the region has made since implementing its direct sales force strategy in 2017. Since 2018, Asia's margin improvement is impressive, up approximately 500 basis points. Further, on a two-year stack, EBITDA margins were up 270 basis points in the quarter or 135 basis points per year on average. As you look across our portfolio, a couple of common themes will continue to drive strong performance. First, is our relentless focus on investments in superior innovation to help our customers solve their most challenging and complex problems and fuel market outgrowth over the long-term. The second is using transformation savings to fund business reinvestments and drive margin expansion. We're on track to deliver $300 million in transformation savings by 2023, which we'll touch on a bit later in the presentation. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number 8. Commercial HVAC Americas has significantly outperformed the broader markets over a number of years through strong focus, agility and execution, combined with relentless innovation for our customers. These defining characteristics power the business forward today. End markets are improving with continued strong data center and warehouse demand. Demand in the education and office end markets is also growing. We're benefiting from increased demand across our K-12 customers, with federal stimulus funds supporting both current and more importantly, future growth. We see this as a multiyear tailwind for our business, given our strong position in the education market and our direct sales force with deep relationships in this vertical. Vaccination rates are improving and end market indicators are generally strong, with ABI over 50 since February, as one example. Demand remains high for comprehensive indoor air quality solutions, with particularly strong interest from education, government and office end markets. We continue to see indoor air quality as a long-term tailwind for our business. Though we remain prudent and cautiously optimistic, given the emergence of new COVID variants and the unpredictable impacts they may have, we enter the second half of the year with very strong backlog and are encouraged by the healthy demand picture that is forming. Turning to Residential, we delivered record second quarter bookings and revenue and are entering the second half of the year with record backlog. Overall, we delivered a strong first half and expect a challenging second half against tough comps, given record bookings and revenue in the second half of 2020. Turning to Americas transport, we're expecting continued strong growth for the balance of 2021, with weighted average transport market growth of approximately 24% for the year. Given strong demand for trucks, trailers and APU through the first half of the year, and supply constraints at OEMs limiting the market size for 2021, we have pretty good visibility at this point, but our transport business will continue to have a strong year and that 2022 has the potential to be even stronger. I'll talk more about transport outlook in our topics of interest section. Turning to EMEA, economic conditions are improving across the region. We expect continued improvement in the back half of the year with increased vaccination rates supporting the opening of an increased number and the ride of venues. Transport markets have been and remained strong. We are expecting 9% weighted average market growth. Our transport business is outperforming the broader markets and 2021 should be a very good year for us. Turning to Asia, we expect growth in China in 2021, supported by increased vaccination rates and strength in data centers, electronics, pharmaceutical and healthcare. Outside of China, the picture is mixed. Vaccination rates generally remain low, with partial lockdowns in some countries. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number nine. After an outstanding first quarter, we raised our full year guidance significantly with a clear goal of delivering top quartile EPS growth in 2021. Halfway through the year, we're seeing the market strength play out largely as expected. Importantly, we continue to see our 2021 EPS growth guidance as top quartile among peers and other industrials, as we move through the Q2 earnings season. Given increasing inflation and supply chain headwinds, we believe our guidance remains prudent at this time. We are raising our revenue guidance, largely to reflect the additional $150 million in pricing we are executing to offset an additional $150 million of inflation in the second half of the year, as Dave outlined. Net, we've raised our organic growth estimate to approximately 11%, up from our previous guidance of 9%. We also expect to deliver strong organic leverage of approximately 30% for the full year. Other elements of our guidance remain largely unchanged, as you can see on the slide. All in, total revenue growth is expected to be approximately 13.5% and adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $6.05, which translates to approximately 36% earnings growth versus 2020. We continue to expect free cash flow to remain strong and equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net income. Please go to slide number 10. We've covered the main points of our guidance, so I won't spend a lot of additional time on this slide. The key takeaways are that we continue to expect strong organic growth, leverage and adjusted EPS in 2021. Additionally, M&A and FX each adds additional revenues with modest EPS impact. The primary driver, which moves our leverage target from 35% to 30% for 2021, is the additional $150 million in price we're executing in the second half of 2021 to offset incremental inflation. Please go to slide number 11. We typically only provide annual guidance, however, given the comparisons from unusual 2020 throughout this year, we believe it may be constructive to provide some additional details on the second half outlook. Based on orders, backlog, and market visibility, we currently expect organic revenues to be up approximately 7% in the second half of the year. Acquisitions are expected to add about 1.5 points of growth. Assuming FX holds at current rates, FX would add about another 50 basis points of growth. All-in, total revenues are expected to be up about 9%. In the back half of the year, we continue to expect additional volume to generate strong underlying leverage in the high 20% range. Embedded in that expectation is a netting of transformation savings and other productivity programs, inflation, and continued reinvestment in the business. All of these elements were part of the full year guidance we provided in May. As we've highlighted, the main change since providing guidance in May is $150 million of additional price we discussed. Mathematically, this drives leverage around nine points lower in the back half of the year. We're also taking stock of where we are from a stressed supply chain and logistics standpoint, which is not unique to us, but carries with it real costs and inefficiencies. Our business operating system and our transformation savings are mitigating a large portion of these inefficiencies and we expect to see just a few points of leverage headwind in the back half of the year. All-in, we expect organic leverage in the high teens during the second half of 2021, with successful execution of price to cover material inflation. The other piece of guidance we would provide at this time is that we expect the fourth quarter to have stronger revenue growth than the third quarter, with similar leverage in both Q3 and Q4. Please go to slide number 12. As we outlined during our investor event in December, by transforming Trane Technologies, we initially identified $100 million of fixed cost reductions by 2021. We exceeded our initial cost reduction expectations, delivering $100 million of savings in 2020, a full year early. In 2021, we're on track to deliver $90 million of incremental savings, for a total of $190 million in savings. This performance gives us confidence to deliver $300 million of run rate savings by 2023. We will continue to invest these cost savings to further strengthen our high-performance flywheel, which has a reinforcing and compounding effect over time. Please go to slide number 13. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy that is focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. We continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. We have a long-standing commitment to a reliable, strong, and growing dividend that increases at or above the rate of earnings growth over time. We continue to pursue strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns, and we have a strong pipeline of M&A opportunities. We also continue to see value in share repurchases and as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. All-in, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Please turn to slide 14, and I'll provide an update on how we're deploying excess cash in 2021. We are on track to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in 2021. Year-to-date, we have deployed $1.3 billion in cash, with nearly $700 million to M&A and share repurchases, including approximately $250 million of share repurchases in July. We have paid $282 million in dividends and $300 million to pay down debt. As I shared, we have a strong pipeline of M&A opportunities and continue to see value in our shares. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please go to slide number 16. As we've done in the past couple of quarters, we want to provide an update on the transport markets. Our outlook for 2021 is largely unchanged, with modest adjustments to North America and EMEA numbers. As we discussed earlier, trailer production capacity is constrained in 2021, which is shifting volume to 2022. EMEA added one point of overall growth on truck and trailer strength. Halfway through the year, we're seeing considerable strength in both of these markets across bookings, revenue and backlog, which supports the forecast from ACT and IHS, with an even higher degree of confidence than when we reported our first quarter results. The other point I'd like to highlight is that ACTs forecast for 2022 stands at 51,100 units, up 17% from 2021. This is another strong tailwind for us as we look towards 2022. Please go to slide number 17. 2021 is shaping up to be a strong year for us overall. Our current guidance firmly places our EPS growth in top quartile of industrial companies, supported by high-quality free cash flow. Energy efficiency and sustainability megatrends are only growing stronger, and we are uniquely positioned to deliver leading innovation that addresses these trends and accelerates the world's progress. And we're not only focused on investments in innovation and growth, but also on investments in our business transformation. We are on track to deliver $300 million in savings that will continue to improve the cost structure of the company. This will enable additional reinvestment to expand margins and further strengthen our ability to outgrow end markets. When combined with the megatrends underpinning our strategy, strong demand in our end markets, our exceptional ability to generate free cash flow and our balanced capital deployment, we are well-positioned to continue to drive differentiated shareholder returns. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just homing in on the color on slide 11, which is very helpful. On the operating leverage, is there any sense when you look at that second half all-in sort of mid-teens leverage figure, which geographic segments may be hardest hit by that, if any? And any context around commercial HVAC versus Transport versus Residential? Any big changes in the operating leverage or divergences across those categories? Chris Kuehn : Hey Julian, it's Chris. I'll start and then Dave may jump in. As you know, we don't guide specifically to margins or revenue growth by segment. We are anticipating in the second half, high teens organic leverage, really mid-teens all in, when you factor in M&A and FX for where we see it today. Underlying leverage across the businesses is strong. What we're factoring into the second half is additional price to cover material inflation, which is driving down those decrementals by approximately 9 points versus our previous guide of 30% organic leverage for the second half of the year. That, plus the supply chain constraints that Dave talked about earlier, are really factoring in why we think it's high teens organic leverage across the second half of the year. And really, when you think about supply chain and price, it's really impacting all of our segments. When I think about the Americas, EMEA and Asia, we're all being impacted by similar concerns around raw material inflation, around supply chain constraints, they're happening in all the regions. David Regnery : Yes, Julian, this is Dave. Thanks for the question. Yes, as Chris said at the end, we're really seeing this across the globe. Supply chain constraints are real. They're not unique to Trane Technologies. I think the entire industry his seeing these and the material inflation, I've never seen it like this before, and I've been in this industry for a long time. but it's really -- it's accelerating certainly in the \u2013 at the end of the first quarter to the second quarter, and that's why we've taken out our third price increase of the year. Julian Mitchell : And you gave some helpful context around the sort of third and fourth quarters having similar operating leverage across both of them. Let me try and look a little bit, say further out beyond the next few months and what you've announced on extra price increases. And when you take into account the sort of rolling of hedging rates and sort of cost management, do we think that you get back into balance with more normal operating leverage early next year, or it's too early to call that, and there's too many sort of moving parts right now? Chris Kuehn : Julian, I think the latter end of your point there, there's just a lot of moving parts at this point for us to call 2022. As we talked about in our December Investor Day, we're really looking towards 25% organic operating leverage on an annual basis. We still think, we've got the demand and the internal structure and cost takeout transformation actions to support that. But as we get closer to 2022, we have a much better view of that inflation environment, supply chain environment as it exists and call it as we get closer to the year. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Chris Kuehn : Thanks Julian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks. Good morning everyone. Just two for me. Just first on capital deployment. How active is the M&A pipeline? I fully understand if it doesn't materialize, sounds like you'll toggle to share repurchase. But is there kind of a decent shot on goal that there's a sizable chunk or two going into M&A here as we close out the year? David Regnery : Yes, Jeff, this is Dave. I won't give you too much specifics there, but our pipeline is very robust, okay, with M&A. And by the way, we've had a great track record with the M&A that we've been able to deploy or actually acquired in the last several years, whether it be on the channel side or on the technology side. So our M&A pipeline is robust and we're hopeful, we can execute on some of that. Jeff Sprague : Okay. And just as a follow-up, and I missed the first few minutes of the call, so I'm sorry if you addressed this. But on the supply chain in general, I'm sure kind of labor and other issues, are you actually at a point of kind of capacity constraint, where you're not fully needing kind of end demand, as it's currently materializes in front of you? And how do you see that playing out in the back half? David Regnery : Yes. I mean the good news, Jeff, is the order demand really across the globe has been extremely strong, not only in the second quarter but also in the first quarter. And we have stressed our supply chain. I don't think this is unique to Trane Technologies. I think the all industrials are facing this. But yes, we have some challenges in the supply chain. Our team is doing a great job of managing it. They're helping our suppliers ramp up. But we anticipate that through the third quarter, this challenge will continue. We see it getting a little better in the fourth quarter as some of our key suppliers are able to ramp up. And by the way, in the industry, a lot of competitors use the same supplier. So this is not unique to Trane Technologies. But again, it is constraining us a bit, it's causing some inefficiencies. Team is doing a fantastic job of getting components to the factory. Unfortunately, they're just not showing up exactly when we need them. So we're constantly having to reschedule lines and rebalance output to meet our customers' demand and expectation. Again, it will be challenging through the third quarter. We see again a little bit better in the fourth quarter. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. David Regnery : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. David Regnery : Hey, Josh. How are you doing? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Good, thanks. So just one follow-up on Resi. Obviously, between supply chain and kind of different instances of sell-in versus sell-through, I think the numbers have moved around a lot this quarter. Yes, I apologize, much like Jeff, I missed the first few minutes, but could you say where you ended up in the quarter and then how you sort of feel about backlog or kind of ability to deliver in the second half vis-\u00e0-vis supply chains or inventory out there and the independent channel, et cetera? David Regnery : Sure. I'll then give you a little more color around Residential in total. First of all, we're seeing very, very strong demand in Residential. Bookings in the quarter were up 37%. Year-to-date, our bookings are up over 40%. So really, really strong demand. Sell-through through our independent wholesaler distributors was up in the high 20s, very close to 30%. So that's good news. That's really how they're serving their dealers. Sell-in to the channel was less. It was up in the mid- to high teens. Revenue in the second quarter for us was at record levels. So revenue was record levels. And backlog was also at record levels. We typically measure backlog in this business in weeks. We're now talking about backlog close to two months. So again, very strong demand that we're seeing in this space. Everyone in the industry is seeing eye-popping numbers in Residential. And it's kind of an odd time. I've been in this industry a long time and everything you make right now is sold. So, the more you make, the more you're going to sell. Demand is so strong that it has outpaced the capabilities of our supply chain as I mentioned earlier. So, we're in the process of helping our suppliers ramp up and again, we see challenges continued through the third quarter, I think we see the supply chain a lot stronger in the fourth quarter. So, I think our incremental growth rates in the third quarter will be less than what we're going to see in the fourth quarter. And again, the supply chain constraint is not unique to Trane Technologies and we believe that, hopefully, in the fourth quarter, this will start to work through. The other point I would add is that in the resi space, we typically think about production like you have peaks and -- peak times and you have trough times, we see peak time continuing for an extended period of time. And we see us running at peak rates at all of our factories for a continued period of time. The other thing I would mention there is -- and I know there's probably some questions out there about share in residential, I would tell you that over the last six years, we've gained share in our residential business. I would -- you're going to have some disconnects at least in the short-term here with how many order share for shipping share. But over time, when backlogs deplete themselves to get back to a normal level, we see that evening out and we see ourselves gaining share in the future. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's comprehensive. I appreciate that. And then I guess on the commercial side, in the Americas, there's also a whole lot of different factors at once. We've seen the light commercial bounce back pretty solidly. Cyclically, obviously, those customers seem like they would have been most impacted during COVID. But maybe on the applied or larger unitary side, new construction benefit or energy retrofit side, how would you sort of carve off the strength that you're seeing as being tilted toward one or the other? David Regnery : Yes. I mean if you look at across the verticals in our commercial HVAC business in the Americas, I don't think there's a time that I've seen where every vertical had growth and we play in all verticals. So, the strength is widespread, which is a good thing. Obviously, on a macro level, you have ABI, which has been very strong since February. So, that's going to be a strong tailwind. Look at that six months out. But we're seeing strength everywhere. And indoor air quality is certain part of it. Office strength coming back, which is nice. A lot of strength in the education vertical right now, we're starting to see stimulus funds be used for upgrading the infrastructure of our schools. It's really a broad based. The more energy-efficient your product is and the greater your innovations are, you're really able to capture a lot of these opportunities. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great color. Thanks guys. David Regnery : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. David Regnery : Hey Nigel. Nigel Coe : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Hi guys. Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Let me go back to residential, just to be clear. So, this isn't Trane capacity constraints, this is supply chain competitors on residential. Just curious, where are you seeing the major pinch points on the supply chain? And you mentioned you're suppliers to cope with that, what measures are you taking to help them with that? David Regnery : Yes. First of all, the supply inconsistencies is really throughout our entire business on a global basis. I think it started, Nigel, really with the freak storm that hit the southeast and knocked out all the resin supply and the knock-on effects that, that continues to have through the supply chain, whether it be wire harnesses or you have and it certainly has an impact on electronics. And as our products have gotten smarter through the years, electronics is everywhere. And it's not just the controller for the unit. We're seeing in fans, motors, compressors, they all are interconnected within the system. They all use electronics to connect. So it's very broad-based. I mean, I think our team is doing just a fabulous job working 24/7 to mitigate this, but it's a little bit of a whack-a-mole, where you see one supplier fixed, the next one goes -- has a little bit of problems. And what we're doing though is, we're working with our strategic suppliers as partners here, and we'll actually have teams help them with their ramp-up. And that's why I said, we have some visibility, we know Q3 is going to be -- continue to be challenged. We see the fourth quarter, some of our ramp-up plans with our suppliers getting better. So, we think the fourth quarter will be a bit better than the third quarter. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great color. Thanks. And then on the M&A pipeline, you've seen some pretty richly priced deals to put it mildly coming through amongst some of your industrial peers. Is the major barrier pricing, or is it more fit at this point? And are you focused mainly on hardware acquisitions, or are you looking more software technology? David Regnery : Yes. At the end of the day, I mean, our M&A pipeline is very robust right now. We're using the same model that we've always used, okay? So, we're going to make sure that it clears our hurdles. We're not going to buy for the sake of buying it. There are -- there is some value out there. We've certainly seen that in some of our channel acquisitions, and we certainly have seen it in some of our technology acquisitions. So stay tuned and our pipeline is robust. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks Dave. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Yes, good morning. David Regnery : Good morning. Hey Andrew how are you? Andrew Obin : I am good. Thank you. If you hear different type of background, my apologies. David Regnery : That\u2019s okay. I think we\u2019re all getting used to that in our COVID world. Andrew Obin : Its \u2013 if we could talk about resi, just sorry to hammer it, but it sounds like if you think about seasonality, September and October are just much lower volume months. So, is it fair to assume that you could have been up year-over-year in Resi, given the demand backlog, if it wasn't for supply chain constraints? A - David Regnery>: Yes. I think there's a couple of things there. Obviously, our backlog is very large right now in our Residential business. Again, we usually look at this as 1 to 2 weeks. Now we're close to 2 months. So obviously, as you burn the backlog, you'll get back to a normal rate. Supply chain is certainly part of the constraint. I would also tell you that, if you remember back in February, a freak storm went through the Southeast and hit our plant in Tyler, Texas, where we had a partial roof collapse of our building there. A relatively small portion of the building, but we did have to recover from that and I think our team did a great job of recovering that, even during peak season. I think first of all, nobody was hurt, which is a good thing. I think the plant was up and running, producing product within 5 days. And that ramp-up is going as scheduled. It is a ramp-up though. So, it was a disruption that we've overcome. We're producing at rate now. And obviously, we're producing a lot of product, because we had record revenue in the month of -- or in the second quarter. That said, supply chain is really our constraint right now, and we're managing through it and we have line of sight to seeing the fourth quarter to be a bit better than the third quarter. Chris Kuehn : Dave, what I would add is from a second half perspective of 2020, the residential was a very strong performance, coming out of lockdowns. I think we saw mid to high teens growth in the second half of last year in residential. So either way, it will be tough comps into the second half of 2021. And to Dave's point, the supply chain matters are really endemic to the industry, but we're working with customers. We're meeting demand with customers today, and we're continuing to do that, and we expect to do that through Q3 and Q4. Andrew Obin : Thank you. And just maybe for applied business, can you just talk about visibility on your key institutional verticals and particular education and healthcare? Thank you. David Regnery : Yeah. We're seeing -- certainly saw strength in the second quarter in both education and healthcare, very strong verticals for us, and we're seeing nice activity there. Our pipeline going forward remains very robust. Our pipeline is defined as orders that aren't yet closed that were we're talking to customers about. So we have a great value proposition in both of those verticals. So we see strength there for -- into the future. Andrew Obin : I leave it at that. Thank you very much. David Regnery : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning guys. David Regnery : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : So maybe if I could ask Andrew's question in a different way. You've talked about IQ demand trending toward the high end of your 1% to 2% range for this year. Now that you've had some time to analyze the behavior of your customers, are you seeing more customers asking you to come in and do the day two type work? And could you talk about longevity of the cycle for the verticals such as education offices? I know you said in your prepared remarks that this could be a multiyear cycle, but do you see a 2% tailwind for several years at this point? David Regnery : Yeah. We do see it as a 1% to 2% tailwind for our business into the future. That said, this year we'll be closer to 2%. We are seeing day two activity in the education vertical as we provided roadmaps to our customers, how they could upgrade their infrastructure and obviously, now with stimulus funding becoming available, some of that is happening. So that's good news. The other thing we're seeing is we're seeing a lot of demand in the office space for audits, is the indoor air quality audits as people are thinking about how they're going to get their employees back to the office. So that's upticked nicely. And we're going to go through the same exact process we did with the education vertical and the office vertical. So we see that coming back as well. The other thing I would tell you, Andy, is it's getting more and more difficult to say what is indoor air quality versus what is just part of an applied system. So it's very similar to maybe like controls, where it's -- if you tell me the controls number, I'm not sure what you're referring to. It's getting to be that on the indoor air quality as these solutions to have better indoor air quality are being embedded in our applied systems. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful. And then if I shift gears and talk about transport refrigeration, obviously, there's a lot to ask there. But let me ask you about the longevity of the cycle. You've mentioned the slower orders in the quarter, given capacity constraints. But given the backlog you have and the constraints out there, would you say transport refrigeration still grows double digits in 2022? And you really have good visibility into 2023 now, given what's going on out there. David Regnery : Yeah. I wouldn't be concerned at all about the low order intake in Q2. I mean if you go back to Q1, we had unbelievable bookings growth. So -- and it's really just customers placing orders for the full year. So we're not concerned about the order intake in our Thermo King business at all. That said, we are seeing some constraints on the trailer OEMs, okay? And every trailer that they don't manufacture, we see that volume pushing into 2022. Obviously, you're not going to sell a trailer reefer unit if you don't have a box to put it on. If you look at 2022, at least in the Americas, if you look at the ACT Report, they now have the trailer market at 51.1%, which is 17% above what they have 2021 -- I'm sorry, for 2022, they have it at 51.1%. So it's 17% above 2021. So it's going to be robust. If you go out to 2023, they're forecasting now, at least the trailer market, to be in the mid-40,000 range, which, by the way, is where the industry has been in North America for really nine of the last 10 years, if you exclude 2020. So we see, certainly, 2022 will be a strong year. I think it's a little early to call the exact percentage there, but it will be a strong year for our Thermo King business. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it. David Regnery : Thanks, Andy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Good morning and congrats on the transition, et cetera, et cetera and best of luck. Just on price cost, I mean, you talked about the incremental impact of pricing cost. Can you just talk about what you had initially planned for the year, so what the total numbers are? And then what you booked in the quarter? Chris Kuehn : Steve, I'll go. This is Chris. In Q2, I'll start there. Price cost was positive, and we were positive in the first quarter or positive in the second quarter. But in the second quarter, we saw direct material inflation, roughly 4 times the size in Q2 as we did in Q1. So it was really starting to ramp up, and that continues to ramp into the second half of the year. With the guide in the second half now, where we added $150 million of price to offset $150 million of inflation, it's about 2 points of price in the second half of the year to cover inflation. That $150 million, it's a little bit more than what we had in the original guidance for the second half of the year. So I won't size it exactly, but it's a record, certainly for us, in the last 10 years in terms of inflation. What we do see different around this cycle is where we've been on par or ahead of pricing to cover material inflation. I think about 2017, 2018, that last inflationary cycle, it took us many quarters, five, six quarters to catch up on price cost. This time, we're positive Q1, we're positive Q2. We expect that to be flattish in the second half of the year, just given trying to keep up with inflation. That $150 million is really an increase just from when we last talked in May. So it still remains volatile here. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit additional color. David Regnery : The operating system that we have in place today, Steve, versus what we had in 2016, 2017, I mean, we're able to really hone in what we need to do in pricing real time almost. And remember, most applied jobs are -- there's not a price list for an applied job. Steve Tusa : So what is total absolute dollar cost headwind for the year? Chris Kuehn : Yes. I don't think I'd describe an actual dollar cost number. I think, I would say, for the full year, we expect to be flattish on price cost. It could be a little bit favorable, depending on where things fall out. But I think it's very volatile to call the year. Second half of the year, we've got from a commodity perspective, roughly 70% locked with copper, actually 60% locked now with aluminum. That's a step-up for us with some recent hedging that we've done in that space. So I think we still have a little bit of exposure on commodities for the second half of the year. So I hate to try to peg it to any one number, just given the volatility we've seen, but it's significant. Steve Tusa : Right. And then lastly, just on light commercial, how did that -- how did a light commercial unitary do in the quarter? Equipment? David Regnery : Yes. Our unitary business was up well over 30% on an incoming order rate basis. So we're very strong in unitary. Steve Tusa : Same in revenues? David Regnery : No, revenue, a little bit of back -- actually, it's pretty close in revenue, too, but a bit -- a little bit less than that. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks for color. Appreciate it. David Regnery : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John Walsh : Hi. Good morning, everyone. David Regnery : Hi, John. Chris Kuehn : How are you, John? John Walsh : Good, good. Thank you. Hey, I apologize if I missed this earlier, but could you talk about -- I mean you made the point applied projects are -- there's not a standard price list. Can you talk about if your customers are delaying any projects as they just see broad-based inflation? I'm thinking this is a little bit more on the new construction side, but I would just love to get your perspective there. David Regnery : Yes. We're not -- obviously, with the incoming order rates, we're seeing very strong demand, John. So we're not seeing delays there. But what we are seeing is we are seeing delays in job sites being ready to receive equipment. So we have seen that. It started to pick up in the second quarter. I think the construction industry is certainly struggling getting skilled labor. And we have seen several job sites push out, which is causing our backlog again to be very strong in our commercial space. Obviously, we're not going to ship a product to a job site if the customer is not ready to receive it, not on the incoming side, but certainly on the outgoing side, we've seen some delays. John Walsh : Great. And then just on Europe, I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more color there what you're seeing in the market around heat pump demand? Obviously, we saw that fit for 55%. And then I don't know if I saw what your Commercial HVAC orders did in Europe in the quarter. I apologize if you said that in the prepared remarks, but I was just looking for that number in particular. Thank you. David Regnery : Sure, John. I mean, a little color on Europe, okay? Order rates up 53%. Revenue up close to 30%. I think it was up 28%. And we saw substantial strength in both businesses, both our Commercial HVAC and our Thermo King business, and it's really led by innovation. And if you look at our Commercial HVAC business, we're seeing high demand for our variable water flow systems, which is really the electrification of heating. We're also seeing high demand for industrial process cooling as we've been able to expand the operating maps of our products so we can now work in the industrial cooling space. So again, it's really led by innovation. If I go to our Thermo King business, I would tell you that the Advancer product that we introduced 1.5 years ago, I mean we're just -- it is exceeding customers' expectations. I had a customer that I talked into ordering some Advancer units early on. And I told them about the expectations they should have for this product. The customer literally emailed me about a week ago and said you were wrong in your expectations. And I was concerned that I read out in the e-mail and have said, you actually exceeded what you told me you were going to do from an energy efficiency standpoint for the Advancer product and I want to order more. So, the Advancer is really just -- it's a step function change in the trailer reefers space in Europe, and we couldn't be happier for -- I couldn't be happier for that team and I'm so proud of that team, what they've been able to accomplish. So, it's a great story for us in Europe and we expect continued success in the future. John Walsh : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. David Regnery : Sure. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Joel Tiss : Hey guys. How is it going? David Regnery : Good. How are you Joel? Chris Kuehn : Good. Good morning. Joel Tiss : All right. I wonder if we could just zero in on Asia for a little bit and just I don't know if there's any implications from the government cracking down for you guys to rethink or is there attractiveness in residential to start to push into there? And are you still gaining market share? Just a little bit of color about what's going on there? David Regnery : Yes, I think our Asia business continues to execute well. In the quarter, I think our incoming order rate was in the low teens, which is nice growth. We're continuing to see margin expansion, is another great story. Chris talked about that earlier. We had, I think, it's 270 basis points of margin. If you look at it on a two-year stack, if you go back four years from when we made the significant investment we did in our sales force, it's up over 500 basis points. So, we're very happy with our performance, what's happening right now in Asia. If your question is really around China, we see what the government is doing there as a tailwind for our business. You think about what they're doing in the carbon trade market, I think they launched that in July. Again, that's -- we're all about decarbonizing the built environment, and we have the portfolio of products to do that. So, -- and again, if you look out further with their goals to be carbon neutral by 2060, we have -- we're going to play a big part in helping the government there achieve those targets. So, there's a big built environment there. There's a lot of product to replace and we have a great portfolio to help with the mission to decarbonize China specifically, but really the whole world. Chris Kuehn : Dave, I'd add. I think that team over the last several years has also really struck a great balance with revenue growth and margin expansion, just looking at both sides of that equation and really the margins in the backlog continue to hold up well. So, I think from the quarter perspective, it's really a law of small numbers, but the discipline they have on both revenue growth and margin expansion has really been outstanding. David Regnery : Yes. And Chris brings up a good point there. The discipline around the order side as we get closer to the customer and we can explain our value proposition, it's a great story there. The whole build-out of the direct sales force becoming basis of design, we're very happy with our results in Asia right now. Joel Tiss : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. David Regnery : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. I'll now turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Thank you everybody for joining today's call. As always, we'll be available at any time to take your questions. We look forward to seeing you all soon and have a great day. Be safe. Operator : Thank you.

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker's remarks, and the Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. . I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Zac Nagle : Thanks, Operator. Good morning. And thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies, Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com where you will find the Company in presentation. We're also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are non-historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are David Regnery, CEO and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I will turn the call over to Dave. Dave. David Regnery : Thanks, Zac and everyone for joining us on today's call. Let's turn to Slide number 3. As we do each quarter, I'd like to spend a few minutes upfront on our focus sustainability strategy, the engine that enables us to deliver differentiated shareholder returns over time. Long term sustainability mega trends continue to intensify and our innovation leadership is transforming the climate industry as the world de -carbonizes. Our aggressive goals and bold actions can dramatically reduce carbon emissions and accelerate the world's progress. This is more critical every day as the clock is ticking on climate change. That's why we're calling for businesses and governments to take stronger action at COP26, and why we continue to set aggressive science-based emission reduction targets to push our innovation further and faster. That innovation also extends to emerging trends as we see heightened focus on indoor air quality and strong momentum in aging infrastructure in our schools. We continue to make a difference consistently, relentlessly, and over the long term. This unyielding approach drives market outgrowth over the long term. Which in turn helps us drive strong margins and powerful free cash flow to deploy through our balanced capital allocation strategy. The end result is more value across the board for our customers, for our team, for our shareholders, and for the planet. Moving to slide number four, our global team delivered solid execution in the third quarter, and we continue to target top quartile EPS growth for 2021. Bookings were once again exceptional in Q3, building on strong growth in both Q1 and Q2, and bringing our year-to-date organic bookings growth to over 25% for the enterprise. Underlying demand for our innovative products and services have never been stronger, and our Q3 ending backlog reflects the strength. In fact, Q3 ending backlog for the enterprise is up more than 70%, or approximately $2 billion, from year-end 2020 with all three of our business segments at record levels. Americas and EMEA have backlog that are up over 90% and 65% respectively from year-end 2020. We're well-positioned to close out 2021 on a strong note, and to enter 2022 with unprecedented levels of backlog as well. As we highlighted on our second quarter earnings call and in subsequent forums, global supply chains, logistic systems, and labor markets remain tight and inflation is persistent. Our global teams are focused on meeting the unique needs of our wide range in customer base and helping them solve complex challenges on a daily basis as we navigate a challenging yet positive demand in supply environment. Temporary supply chain delays on key materials impacted portions of our product portfolio shifting the timing of approximately $150 million or 4% of our revenue out of the third quarter and into future periods. Working closely with our key suppliers and with our customers, we anticipate that between $50 million and $75 million, roughly 2% of the Q3 impact will shift into the fourth quarter, leaving our 2021 revenue guidance unchanged. We expect the remaining balance to shift into 2022. We also highlighted our second quarter earnings call, that persistent inflation would require us to execute an incremental $150 million in pricing actions in the second half of the year in order to neutralize the impact. Strong execution of our business operating system has enabled us to keep pace with the inflationary curve. In the third quarter, we realized approximately $150 million or 4.3% incremental price, offsetting approximately $150 million of inflation. Leverage was negligible, as you would expect on flat volume. While adjusted operating income was modestly higher in the quarter, primarily reflecting nominal pull-through on M&A and FX growth consistent with our expectations and our guidance. We continue to execute the business transformation projects we discussed in detail at our Investor Day in December and are on track to deliver approximately $90 million of incremental savings in 2021. These savings support leading innovation across our end markets through relentless high levels of business reinvestment. They also enable us to stay on track to deliver incremental margins of approximately 30% organic for fiscal 2021 despite persistent inflation, tight logistics systems, and supply chain challenges. We're also on track to deliver powerful free cash flow of equal to or greater than 100% of net earnings. This provides us with strong optionality to deploy significant cash to opportunities now and in the future, including M&A and share repurchases. Lastly, we never lose sight of our long-term purpose driven strategy and the tremendous leadership role we can play in bending the curve on climate change. By changing the industry, we can change the world. Executing our purpose driven strategy is how we will continue to deliver top-tier financial performance for our shareholders. Please turn to slide number five. While we're still in the midst of our planning process for 2022 and anticipate providing guidance in conjunction with our fourth quarter earnings call, we thought it might be constructive to spend a few minutes discussing our initial thoughts on 2022 and some of the key dynamics we believe will be in play. While this is not a comprehensive list, it will highlight some of the key reasons why we're so excited about what the future holds for Trane Technologies, as well as some of the key challenges we see on the road ahead. First, we expect to have strong fundamentals entering the year. Exiting Q3 backlog in our Americas and EMEA segments are both at unprecedented levels, up over 90%, and up over 65% versus December of 2020, respectively. Asia also has record backlog up nearly 20%. If we very conservatively plot out bookings through the balance of 2021, we anticipate entering 2022 with at least 70% more backlog in the Americas and EMEA than we entered 2020. I've been in this business a long time and I've never entered any year with a stronger backlog position, which bodes well for us in 2022. Another fundamental strength entering 2022 is the foundation of our business operating system. Strong execution of our business operating system has enabled us to stay ahead of the persistent inflation through 2021 and position us well to manage additional inflationary pressures and deliver strong price realization again, in 2022. And we will continue to drive transformation savings in 2022 that will support high levels of business reinvestment and continued innovation. These savings will also support healthy incremental margins in what we expect to be another year of tight conditions for supply chain, labor markets, and logistics systems. Looking out to 2022, we also expect to see continued acceleration of the strong secular sustainability mega trends that are so tightly aligned with our purpose driven business strategy. The decarbonization of the built environment is accelerating. U.S. education stimulus dollars are being put to good use, upgrading our aging infrastructure. And momentum around indoor air quality upgrades, retrofits, and new projects continues. Additionally, the global economy is expected to continue to recover in 2022 with solid underlying GDP and other economic indicators driving broader expansion in the non-residential markets. Lastly, we're excited about the future transport refrigeration markets, where ACT and IHS are plotting a steady growth path forward in both 2022 and 2023. All in, we're exceptionally well-positioned for strong performance in 2022 and beyond. Please turn to slide number six. Customer demand for our innovative climate control products and services continues to grow. We delivered another quarter of robust organic bookings growth up 20% with growth across all segments and business units. Customer demand has been high all year with organic bookings up over 25% year-to-date, driving a record backlog in each segment. Organic revenues were also up 4% driven by continued strong price execution. Our Americas Commercial HVAC business delivered robust bookings growth in the quarter, with orders up over 30%. Strength was broad-based, with applied and unitary bookings both up more than 50% and service bookings up high-teens. Demand for system-focused indoor air quality solutions remained strong and contributed to our mid-single-digit revenue growth in Commercial HVAC Americas. The residential HVAC markets continue to be strong, and our residential team delivered low single-digit bookings growth building on nearly 40% growth in the third quarter of 2020. Revenues were flat in the quarter as demand outpaced supply and we enter the fourth quarter with record backlog, up more than a 150% year-over-year, and up from prior record backlog at the end of the second quarter. With year-to-date organic bookings up over 80% and year-to-date organic revenue up over 30%, our Americas transport refrigeration business is significantly outperforming the North America transport markets. During the third quarter, with most of 2021 orders already in the backlog, we opened up our 2022 order book solely for the first quarter of 2022, which drove bookings growth of more than 20%. We are methodically managing our 2022 order book in order to mitigate inflationary risks. Organic revenues were also strong; up low to mid-teens. Turning to EMEA, we continue to see strong demand for our innovative products and services that help reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for our customers. Our EMEA teams delivered 25% organic bookings growth in the quarter, with strong growth in both Commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration. Revenues were also strong, up 8% led by high-teens organic revenue growth in transport refrigeration. Our Asia Pacific team delivered bookings growth of 11%. Revenue grew 1% in the quarter. Though we saw growth in China during the quarter, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to be challenging in the region, with low vaccination rates in some countries. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number 7. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was driven by continued strong price execution, yielding 4.3% incremental price in the quarter. Price over material inflation was positive in the quarter. And combined with mix, offset the net impact of productivity over other inflation and increased investment spending to support leading innovation. Organic volume, and therefore pull-through leverage, was largely flat for the enterprise in the quarter. At a high level, positive leverage was primarily the result of mix and a modest flow-through of M&A and FX, consistent with our guidance. Net, adjusted EBITDA, and operating margins declined by 70 and 60 basis points respectively. Adjusted EPS grew 5% driven primarily by higher adjusted operating income. Please turn to slide number eight. We discussed the key revenue and margin dynamics for the enterprise on the prior page. The dynamics impacting revenue and margins were similar across each of our business segments as we've highlighted here. But strong price realization, productivity, inflation, and higher investments in innovation as consistent drivers. In EMEA, solid price realization was accompanied by strong volume growth, delivering good leverage and margin expansion in the quarter. Both the Americas and Asia Pacific segments delivered higher revenues on modest volume declines impacting leverage. Asia Pacific also experienced price versus cost headwinds in the quarter, further impacting margins. We continue to expect Asia Pacific to deliver solid margin expansion for the full year and are pleased with our overall performance in the region. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number 9. Commercial HVAC Americas has significantly outperformed the broader markets over a number of years through strong focus, agility, and execution. Combined with relentless innovation for our customers. These defining characteristics compounded by the strength of the underlying market conditions power the business forward today, yielding bookings growth of over 30% in the quarter an exceptional backlog entering Q4. Booking strength was universal across nearly every vertical market and major product category. End-markets continued to improve. Vaccination rates are improving. and end-market indicators are generally strong, with ABI over $50 since February and a healthy GDP. Data centers and warehouse demand remain strong. Education and healthcare end market demand is also growing. We're benefiting from increased demand across our K through 12 customers, with federal stimulus fund supporting both current and more importantly future growth. We see this as a multiyear tailwind for our business, given our strong position in the education market and our direct sales force with deep relationships in this vertical. Our residential end markets remain strong. As I mentioned previously, we delivered low single-digit bookings growth in the quarter, compounding on nearly 40% growth in the prior year. And we are entering the fourth quarter with unprecedented backlog. I'm proud of our residential team that has continued to meet customer demand while ramping capacity after our February weather event in our Texas facility. The team delivered historically high revenues in Q3 and is on track for capacity expansion in advance of next year's cooling season. Turning to Americas transport, we're significantly outgrowing strong end markets in 2021. ACT market forecaster projecting strong growth in 2022 and 2023 as well. I'll talk more about the transport outlook in our topics of interest section. Turning to EMEA, economic conditions are improving across the region. We expect continued improvement for the remainder of the year, with increased vaccination rates supporting the opening of an increased number and variety of venues. Transport markets have been strengthening throughout the year, and we're on track to outperform end markets in 2021, as evidenced by our year-to-date performance. Turning to Asia, we expect growth in China in 2021, supported by increased vaccination rates and strengthened data centers, electronics, pharmaceutical, and healthcare. Outside of China, the picture is mixed, with vaccination and economic recovery rates still low in some countries. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number 10. Given all the puts and takes we've discussed today, our guidance for 2021 is unchanged. Importantly, we continue to see our 2021 adjusted EPS growth guidance of more than 30% as top quartile among peers and the broader industrials. We've discussed the shift in revenues from Q3 to Q4 in 2022 throughout the call. Our fourth quarter revenues are supported by record backlog, and that backlog is firm. Supply chain, labor, and logistic systems will continue to be challenging, and are the limiting factor to potential upside, not demand or backlog. We also continue to expect free cash flow to remain strong at equal to or greater than a 100% of adjusted net income. Please go to slide number 11. As we outlined during our investor event in December, we are on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings by 2023, including $90 million in 2021. Importantly, we continue to invest these cost savings to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio. This consistent investment strengthens our high performance flywheel, which has a reinforcing and compounding effect over time. Please go to slide number 12. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy that is focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy a 100% of excess cash over time using a balanced approach that includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide 13, and I'll provide an update on how we're deploying excess cash in 2021. Year-to-date, we have deployed $1.8 billion in cash with approximately $1 billion to M&A and share repurchases, including $250 million for the Farrar scientific life sciences acquisition, we closed in October. We have paid $422 million in dividends and $425 million to pay down debt. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity, and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality, and dry powder moving forward. We are on track to deploy at least $2.5 billion in excess cash in 2021. Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave. David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please go to slide number 15. I wanted to spend a couple of minutes providing an update on the transport refrigeration markets for 2021, as we've seen the forecast shift with fair amount since our second quarter earnings call. I think the primary takeaway this quarter is that ACT is projecting an extended and more gradual upturn in the North America transport refrigeration markets than initially projected. North America Trailers is probably the clearest example and one of the most watched by investors and analysts as a proxy for the overall transport refrigeration health. ACT started out the year projecting an almost immediate snap-back in the North America trailer production in 2021, up 39% of the lows of the pandemic in 2020. As trailer OEMS have had a challenging year producing enough trailers to meet the forecast, ACT has gradually pulled the forecast down and is now projecting a strong but more gradual improvement in 2021, up 18% and continued improvement in production rates in both 2022 and 2023, up another 18% and 14% respectively. If you look at the all-in weighted average market forecast for North America transport refrigeration, 2021 is now expected to be up about 14% versus 24% projected in July. Year-to-date, our Thermo King Americas transport refrigeration business is up more than 30%. Clearly outperforming the markets, and we expect to outperform the markets for the full year as well. Looking at IHS and other key indicators for EMEA markets, the outlook has improved about 3 points with the weighted average market growth now expected to be about 12% for 2021. Year-to-date, our Thermo King EMEA business is up more than 20% clearly outperforming the markets. And we expect outperformance for the full-year 2021 as well. Please go to slide number 16. We added a second transport refrigeration slide to the deck this quarter to add more color around the North America trailer market, from both backward and forward-looking perspectives. One of the things we've talked about over the past several quarters is the North America trailer market has not been particularly volatile over the past several years, and it's not projected to be particularly volatile over the ACT forecast horizon either. On the left side of the page, you can see the visual depiction of what we've been describing. We chart ACTs reported actual trailer units built going back to 2015, and ACTs forecast for trailer builds through their forecast horizon of 2023. The 9-year average is in the mid 40,000 unit range, with the pandemic in 2020 being the only significant outlier. We also see that good growth is projected in both 2022 and 2023. It's important to note that our global transport refrigeration business is highly diversified. Trailer is an important part of the global mix, at about 25% of the total. However, we're focused on strong execution across the transport refrigeration portfolio, which we believe will further help reduce variability of this business over time. Please go to Slide number 17. 2021 is shaping up to be a strong year for us overall, despite a number of macro challenges that we expect to continue over the near term. We're seeing unprecedented levels of demand for our products and services across the board. And our backlog has never been stronger. We're executing our business operating system well and staying ahead of persistent inflation with strong price realization. And we expect to deliver top quartile EPS growth for the full year. Energy efficiency and sustainability mega trends are only growing stronger. We are uniquely positioned to deliver leading innovation that addresses these trends and accelerates the world's progress supported by a business transformation and our engaging uplifting culture. We are proud to have been recognized by Forbes as one of the best employers for diversity and best employers for women. And by Fortune as one of the best workplaces in manufacturing. It's our people that power our innovation and bring our purpose to life every day. We have many reasons to be excited about our prospects for strong performance as we look to 2022 and beyond. When combined with our exceptional ability to generate free cash flow and our balance capital deployment, we are well-positioned to continue to drive differentiated shareholder returns over the long term. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : this time I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, . Your first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. David Regnery : Hey, Joe, how you doing? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Yeah, doing great. So maybe just the first question on the supply chain. It's helpful to have kind of that visibility on the revenues that pushed out from this quarter. I guess, just any other color that you can provide, is this predominantly occurring in your North America trailer business. And then just confidence that you're going to be able to shift these revenues and not see sustained supply-chain issues in the next few quarters. David Regnery : Yeah. Sure, Joe, great question. Tight supply chain really globally, we talked about it during our second quarter earnings call. It caused us to push about $150 million of revenue out of the quarter, as we said. we think we'll get about 50 to 75 of that back in the fourth quarter. Our team is doing a great job of managing the supply chain constraints. We chose not to include a slide in our deck telling you the 50 things that we're doing to manage our suppliers or help our suppliers. But I could assure you that supply chain resiliency has been part of our business operating system for a long time. And I can assure you that Trane Technologies employees around the globe are working hand in hand with our suppliers, ensuring that we could take literally pages out of our operating system and help them implement it. We think it's going to be choppy for a while on the supply chain, at least for the foreseeable future. It's a little bit, I think I mentioned it in the second quarter call, it's a little bit like when you were a kid, you play that game Whack-A-Mole, where we fix one problem and another problem pops up. But if you're looking for overarching kind of like where are we seeing constraints? I don't think we're -- I know we're not any different than what you probably already heard from the rest of the industrials that have reported. Electronics, resin, semiconductors, wire harnesses, these are all areas that certainly at an overarching level, we're seeing supply chain constraints. That said, just a couple of points I want to make. One is, we're working very closely with our customers. It's very important that in some cases our customers are having supply chain constraints on the job sites, which is causing them to push out jobs. So we're working with them to make sure that we could deliver product when they need it. If you look at our Thermo King business, we're really aligning with our customers there around build slots that they're getting from the trailer OEMS tractor suppliers. So this hand-in-hand relationship with the customer, it's pretty dynamic right now. And then the last point I'd like to make, Joe is that I know we've talked a lot about supply chain constraints. We also have to be fair to our suppliers. I know many of them are probably listening to the call or will read the transcript. We are putting tremendous pressure on our suppliers with the amount of demand that we're seeing in the marketplace right now. If you look at our Commercial HVAC business in the Americas, our unitary and applied both are up over 50% incoming order rates in the third quarter. So with that kind of -- you can imagine we're pushing that right on to our suppliers and putting orders on them. So they're seeing some pretty big spikes that they're having to manage through. Your question on, is there a particular business? It's pretty wide spread. There's more acute maybe in our Thermo King business. We had a couple of suppliers there that we've worked through some of the issues with. So we're pretty confident that we'll be able to rebound there in the fourth quarter. We're also seeing -- we're seeing across the globe the other businesses that would call us probably our Commercial HVAC business. Certainly there the resin impact and kind of a knock-on effect that we've been seeing now for several quarters. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, David. That was helpful. Maybe my one quick follow-up. One of your suppliers, just did their conference call about an hour ago, and they talked about the price cost formula being roughly a $100 million positive for them in 2022, you did a good job with pricing this quarter. I'm just curious as you think about 2022, should we be thinking about a positive price cost environment given what you're seeing in your cost price today. Chris Kuehn : Hey Joe (ph), it's Chris. I'll take the question. So we are in the middle of our 2022 planning. Going into 2022, though, we would expect some carryover price from the three price increases, most of our businesses announced this year, we will start lapping price increases though really starting in the first quarter of next year. But I will tell you as part of our business operating system, we enter every year coming up with a plan of how we're going to get about 20 to 30 basis points, positive spread price costs. More to come in a couple of months as we released guidance for next year, but we're going to go in with the mentality that we're going to cover price cost, but it's also a very inflationary environment which is why we're really trying to size that for pricing increases if we need to going forward. David Regnery : Yeah, the only thing I would add to that, Joe, is that price is never easy to get despite what people may think. But when you have an innovative portfolio of products, it becomes that much easier. As you're selling additional value to your customer, being able to get pricing, it becomes a little bit easier. Joe Ritchie : Great, thank you both. David Regnery : Thanks. Operator : You next question comes from Scott Davis of . Scott Davis : Good morning, guys. Chris Kuehn : Hey, Scott (ph), how are you doing? David Regnery : Good morning. Scott Davis : Good. I want to talk about IAQ if that's okay and the 2 point tailwind that you noted in the slide is pretty material. One, I want to just get some color on the sustainability of that. How many years of project backlog do you ultimately have? Where is that 2% -- it stayed 2%, does it become 3 this year and any kind of view around that. And then what does a systems focused solution really mean for practical purposes for us at least? Does that mean a service contract with monitoring? Maybe just a little color around that too. Thanks. David Regnery : Sure. Good question. As far as the demand goes, we had said early on that we thought would be 1% to 2% tailwind. We're seeing 2% this year. Pipeline is strong. What started out to be strong in really just healthcare and education, we're now seeing in office and other verticals. So that's the good news. On the other thing, I would tell you that if you remember, we had an approach where we were doing indoor air quality audits where we would do a day one activity, where we do the audits, make the environment as safe as possible today with existing assets. And then we give a road map as to how you would do day two activity. Those day two activities are really starting to come through for us, especially in the education with some stimulus funds flowing there. So that's a good news story. As far as we see indoor air quality as a mega trend that's not going to go away. It's top of mind. I mean, Trane Technologies has always had a robust focus on indoor air quality. It was always big in the healthcare vertical. It's now top of mind in all verticals. But we don't see this stopping. We see people constantly asking about indoor air quality. I would tell you that we're building it into our systems, which is kind of your second question there is. This is now integrated into a system, and we're seeing nice traction in all verticals. Chris Kuehn : What I'll add, Scott, is because it is embedded in systems now, it is becoming harder and harder to kind of spike out the impact in indoor air quality separate from a systems order. I've offered Dave, we can hire a few more accounts to try to track those revenues in that level of detail. But I think the fact is, it's really becoming just a long-term tailwind for the Company. David Regnery : Yeah, this is Dave. We're really seeing a lot of traction, especially with our dry hydrogen and peroxide solutions. And this is predominantly in the education vertical as we're building this into the systems. And the dry hydrogen peroxide solution, the unique innovation there is that these molecules last longer. So if you think about a school room where you have students that are moving around the different class rooms on different desks, these molecules actually settle on the desk, so they clean the air as well as the surface. And we're getting a lot of traction around that. Scott Davis : That's very interesting. I'll pass it on to my peers, but thank you and good luck. Chris Kuehn : Thanks. David Regnery : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Chris Kuehn : Good morning, Jeff. David Regnery : Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Hey. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on backlog as it relates to price and, Dave, you mentioned opening a kind of measuring how you open up the order book to not get caught here. To what extent do you have the ability or are you in fact going back and repricing some of the backlog or given the environment that we're in, perhaps you're changing commercial terms just to protect yourself better. If you take an order today and you deliver it 12 months from now, who knows what we're dealing with on the inflation front. So just any color there on how you're managing that, protecting yourself and maybe -- and some flexibility to commercial terms. Chris Kuehn : Hey, Jeff. This is Chris, I'll start and then Dave can jump in. If I go business by business, when we started the residential, really, we have the ability  to look at our backlog and reprice our backlog as we see higher inflation impacting orders that will shift now, a couple of months out where the backlog and residential used to be a couple of weeks, now we see it continue to be a couple of months out. We actually have repriced the backlog already in 2021, but we've got that ability to reprice going forward should we see a significantly more inflation. On the Commercial HVAC side, when I think about long lead time equipment. Those contracts generally have price escalation clauses in them that allows us to reset pricing based on an index. So we have some protection there as well. And then on Thermo King, today's remarks earlier, we've been really selective with opening up the order books for 2022. We wanted to get as much insight as we can get on inflationary environment through the third quarter of 2021. We've only had the first quarter of 2022 order book booking. We've now recently opened up the '22 order book for the balance of the year, and we did that intentionally to make sure we had the right  to reflect that in the backlog. So I think we got really  in terms of price and  inflation. David Regnery : What I would add to that is also we got pricing built in and we got mechanisms in place and also  our backlog is very firm. We're not seeing cancellations on our backlog and don't anticipate cancellations for backlog in the future. Jeff Sprague : And then separately just on resi, I don't think you've mentioned resi in terms of something you're positive on in terms of your 2022 outlook. Obviously, we've got this question that everyone is asking and ensure how the hands are on -- how these comps play out and that sort of thing. Dave, what is your high-level view on how the resi market behaves next year? And certainly you might have a different view on how you behave inside that, but any perspective would be appreciated. And I'll leave it there. Thank you. David Regnery : Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Yeah. We look at our resin business at a very high level as a GDP plus business. So if you could tell us what GDP is, you could tell us what consumer confidence is. We could dial in what our residential business and how it's going to perform. That said obviously we have detailed models that we go through and it's really just to validate our high level approach. So GDP is projected to be positive next year, and we do not see the resi business falling off a cliff in 2022. We see the GDP plus business. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian from Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Just starting with price cost just to understand the sort of jumping off point into next year. I saw you said that you have $150 million of price in Q3, similar sort of cost step up. Maybe just help us understand on those two numbers what should we expect for Q4, and then what's the kind of total year 2021 for price and cost, please. Chris Kuehn : Hey Julian, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we were really pleased with the price realization in the third quarter, 4.3% of price realization and really equals the revenue growth we had in the third quarter as well as we were very flat on volumes. And for the quarter Q3, we saw slightly positive price cost. When I think back a few years ago when we had our last inflationary environment, we were really trying to catch up on the price cost equation. I think it was about six quarters where the Company was negative. Now, we're able to keep up with that at least through Q3 of this year. And really, that goes back to the business operating system we continue to enhance in the Company. So very positive price cost in Q3. For Q4, I'm expecting price realization to get a little bit stronger, but I also can see inflation getting stronger in the fourth quarter as well. So we're right now kind of expecting price cost to be flattish in the fourth quarter. And then we'll see how this kind of plays out for 2022, where we're always targeting 20 or 30 basis points of price over cost for a given year, but I'm expecting that to be flattish in the fourth quarter. Julian Mitchell : That was helpful. Thank you. David Regnery : The only thing the only thing I would add to that is that the operating system, don't underestimate the amount of work we've put into building our operating system to stay ahead of these inflationary curves. I mean, as Chris said, I think it was the last time we had this type of inflation, it took us several quarters to overcome them. And now we're in the quarter being able to offset it. So we're very proud that we've been able to do that. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just following up in terms of overall firm-wide operating leverage, so it looks like, I think, in the fourth quarter, you are looking for maybe 20% also operating leverage year-on-year. I just wanted to check that's roughly the right ballpark. And do you think that's a good sort of entry point starting out next year given you've still got price costs margin headwinds, at least in the first quarter or 2. Chris Kuehn : Yeah, Julian. I think you're in the ballpark for Q4. We left the full-year guide intentionally intact, given that we can see the push-out of some revenues into the fourth quarter. The figure was $75 million. Really, from my perspective, our perspective, the backlog and the demand is very firm. It really comes down to supply chain. And that's why we got the squiggle 605 on the full year from an adjusted EPS perspective. So could it be a little better? Could it be a little worse? I think we're right around that $6.05 based on how we see the supply chains today. But it's really going to depending on that. But you're in the ballpark for fourth quarter. We'll see a lever kind of plays out for next year. I think we're certainly expecting an inflationary environment next year with pricing actions. We'll need to continue to moderate that. But we'll have more insight on that as we get into January. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Hi, Good morning. Chris Kuehn : Good morning, John. John Walsh : Maybe piggybacking off of I think it was Jeff's question earlier. I think in your answer it was mostly around the equipment. I wanted to hear a little bit about your ability to pass-through inflation on your service contracts because obviously labor availability and I think the wage inflation is something we're all expecting in the next year. So give those same ability to pass through those inflationary pressures there? David Regnery : Good question. Yes, we do have a long-term contract and prices for escalations potential. So that estimate is taking into consideration, we have our . John Walsh : Got you. And then maybe coming at the backlog and orders question a little differently here. 20% order growth, it's not like you're comping a down 20, you're comping up plus 7. So how do we think about just the orders rate And if you think you can actually build backlog next year, potentially, obviously, I understand you're not in the business of guiding orders, but it's definitely a question we're getting from investors here. Sort appreciate any color. Thank you. Chris Kuehn : Yeah. If you look at it, it's really phenomenal what's happening right now. We had 30% order growth in the first quarter. We had 30% order growth in the second quarter. And here we are in the third quarter talking about 20%. And in some of our businesses, I call our Commercial HVAC, and equipment's up 50% there. So I don't anticipate that bookings will continue at the 30% growth rate, but I would tell you that we're seeing a lot of demand right now for our innovations in the marketplace. And whether it be in the Thermo King business or in the Commercial HVAC business, that's really driving a lot of this demand for us. And we also have these tailwinds behind us around sustainability and the de - carbonization of the built environment, that it's only gaining momentum. So we like what we see here going into 2022. We're going to have record backlogs and we'll see what 2022 is from an incoming order rate. But right now, we really like the position we have going in. John Walsh : Great. Thank you. I'll pass it along. David Regnery : Thanks. Chris Kuehn : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Chris Kuehn : Hey, Andy. How are you doing? Andy Kaplowitz : Good. How are you? EMEA continues to be a significant out-performer versus the other regions. Maybe you can give us little more color into what's going on there. How big it your heat pump business already become? Are products such as heat pumps and the advanced or just nicely accretive to margin that they're helping? And how sustainable is that 30% incremental you put up this quarter? David Regnery : Yeah. Innovation, you kind of hit on it, Andy. That's what's really driving us in EMEA and it's just such a great place to be. The advancer product in our Thermo King business, it's exceeding our expectations. If you look at what we've been able to do with the electrification of heating in the HVAC business, again, it's in tremendous demand, tremendous demand. I don't want to get into specifics as to how big we are or how large the market is there. But I would tell you that it is propelling our growth and we're excited about what the pipeline looks like in the future. And rest assured, the innovations are continuing there as we continue to look to expand the, what we call the operating maps of how our HVAC product works. We're going for higher temperatures on the heating side and lower temperatures on the cooling side, which are only going to expand our market further. Andy Kaplowitz : Great -- David Regnery : I'll add, Andy. Sorry, on the incremental is your question there. Look, we've set up each of the segments to really have over the long term 25% plus incremental. So, we think Europe is well situated for that over the long run to deliver. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful guys. And then, maybe you can give us a little more color into what you're seeing in Asia. You mentioned record backlog in the region, I did notice that your transfer revenue turned down a bit and the pandemic does remain a challenge in the area. So are you seeing overall China hold up well, and how are you thinking about that region in '22? David Regnery : Yes. I mean, Asia Pacific is about 10% of Trane Technologies, it's an important region for us. Let's talk about it in 2 different pieces, talk about China first, obviously, GDP, it's pretty well documented, has slowed a bit in the third quarter, or at least versus expectations, I think it was 4.9 and expectations were over 6. So it is slowing a bit in China. I would tell you though where it continues to grow. Think about electronics, pharmaceuticals, datacenters, healthcare, are also verticals that we're very strong in. So, we're seeing nice growth in China and we expect that to continue in the future. You get outside of China, it really becomes country-specific. And unfortunately, we're still having some countries that are going into different phases of lockdowns based on where the pandemic is. But it's going to be a little bit mixed outside of China, at least into the fourth quarter. Andy Kaplowitz : I appreciate it, guys. Chris Kuehn : Thanks David Regnery : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hi, guys. Good morning. David Regnery : Hey, Steve. How are you? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Steve Tusa : So where are you going to end on price and cost for the year now, with this neutral back half, neutral - ish back-half, like what was the first-half pricing cost? David Regnery : First-half would have been positive, but are much smaller numbers, Steve. Just given how price has grown considerably from Q1 now to Q3, expecting Q4 to be flattish price cost. The full year, I think we're probably around the flattish range. Maybe it could be slightly positive. Our goal here is to keep driving the innovation and then driving the pricing to reflect what we think the inflation is going to be. So really happy where we are year-to-date on the price realization. Like I said before, it's going to grow a bit in the fourth quarter. At the same time, we're seeing inflation grow into the fourth quarter, and we're really just trying to stay ahead of it. So I'm thinking flattish to slightly positive on the full-year. Steve Tusa : Okay. Chris Kuehn : And Steve, we've already had three price increases in many of our businesses. And if we still see the inflation be persistent, another price increase will be part of our business operating system where we would execute on that. Steve Tusa : Right. I guess I'm just looking for the 150 and the 150, what was that in the first half. David Regnery : I don't know if we've actually probably given that number. It would have probably been less than the 150 would be my guess, but I'd have to go look at that. Steve Tusa : Okay. Thanks. And then on commercial equipment, you said orders up 50%. Can you just split those out between applied and then how did the light commercial kind of unitary business fair within that? David Regnery : To be fair, Steve, it was more than 50%, and both our unitary and applied, we're both over 50%. So the  being part of that number was very strong, as you would imagine. So we have seen unbelievable amounts of growth in our Commercial HVAC equipment business. And it's actually, and I've said it earlier, but it's actually, to be fair to our suppliers, we're putting that demand right on them. So it's causing them to have to spike forward as well. Steve Tusa : Yeah, that's very positive. And then one more for you, what would sell through? For you, what do you think movement was for your resi business, but stuff that you know to the customer  given out before. David Regnery : Yeah. On the IWG side, which again, is about 50% of our business sell-through was mid single-digits, sell-in was flat. So obviously their inventory adjusted as you would expect, in a shoulder season. The next to follow-on question is, Steve, would be, what's inventory level look like in the IWG space? It's about what you would expect, maybe a bit lower than we would like this time a year, but it's nothing to call out. Steve Tusa : Great. Great color. Thanks a lot. David Regnery : Okay. Steve Tusa : Thanks, Dave. David Regnery : Steve, to your earlier question, just to follow up on that for the first half kind of price for the enterprise is around 2.2%. So less than a $150 million we realized in Q3, we got a little less than that for the first half of the year. So that price is really ramped up from the first half to Q3 and we're expecting that to be stronger even in Q4. Steve Tusa : Yeah. And cost? End cost, the 150 cost? David Regnery : I would say in the first half was positive, again, with less than 150, but positive in the first half, slightly positive in Q3. And we're expecting 5s for Q4. Steve Tusa : Okay, thanks. David Regnery : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel, your line is open. Nigel Coe : Sorry. Comes on me and I had a pretty funny joke which I won't repeat. David Regnery : We want to hear the joke. Nigel Coe : I was going to say, let's go back to that first half price cost question, but let's not. But I do want to go back to the backlog because obviously super hot, plus 70 in Americas. I'm just wondering, is the -- how does the aging of that backlog look? I mean, do you expect the majority of that to convert in 2022 outside of supply chain pressures. And I guess my real question is, I know you're not going to answer this specifically, but we really haven't grown higher than 8%, 9% in climates over time organically. And I'm just curious, could 2022 be above that bar. Just curious if that backlog converts? David Regnery : Yeah. As we said earlier, we're still working through the 2022, but just talking about the backlog. I mean, you really need to -- as far as when it burns, you really need to go through it by business. So if you think about our Commercial HVAC business with applied orders, that backlog, when an order comes in, there could be a 6 to 9-month burn rate on those type orders before the actual ship. In the Teekay, it's a little bit different this year than I've seen in other years. We had a lot of customers place orders in the first quarter and kind of lay them in through the rest of the year. And the other complication with Teekay we're seeing right now is obviously we're working with our customers on their slots for trailers and tractors. So normally the burn rate in Teekay would be 2 months to 3 months. That's been extended a little bit just because of the constraints associated with the actual building of a trailer. On the resi space, our backlog turns. It's turning on a regular basis. And overall, I mean, we have a very large backlog. We have order demand that is some of the best I've ever seen in my career. But understand, our backlog is not stale. It continues to churn and we're shipping out, we're just getting order rates that we haven't seen in a very long time in this business that are continuing to build this backlog. Nigel Coe : Okay. I'll leave that backlog question there. On price cost, you did call out APAC as challenging near-term and I think we're all tuned into the fact that APAC of a time as being a bit more challenging on price. So just curious, we've seen some deflation in APAC and any concerns as we go into 2022 around that region? David Regnery : Yeah, Nigel, I would say, yes, price costs right now, it's a little bit challenging in the near-term. We're really are on track to having very strong full-year margin expansion in the region. If I go back, even just two years, a two-year stack, we're up over 400 basis points in margin expansion in the region. If we go back to when we invested in our direct sales force of over 500 basis points. So the region has had some great growth, being very selective around orders as well. I will tell you that we'll continue to evaluate the pricing environment and make price increases where necessary. And I'd be looking for that region like for the rest of the Company to be getting price cost positive going into 2022, but near-term, little bit of challenges. It's also a little bit of loss small numbers for revenue, our margin contraction in the quarter for Asia in Q3. Nigel Coe : Okay, thanks. That's great color. Thanks. David Regnery : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Josh Pokrzywinski : David Regnery : Hey, Josh. How are you doing? Josh Pokrzywinski : Well, thanks. Just on this commercial equipment growth, I mean, look, for what is historically kind of a replacement business and with a pretty massive installed base like 50% sort of an eye-popping number. Obviously supply chain and bottlenecks are kind of everywhere like -- is there sufficient labor, whether it's in your own house or out there in the independent world virtually install this stuff in a reasonable timeframe or is that going to be a gating factor on converting that backlog as well? David Regnery : In as far as labor constraints in our own four-walls, it's really -- we have seen some early in Q3. This subsided a bit as we moved through the quarter. We're planning for it. It's just a matter of how your training mechanism and hiring of new people. So that's happening. On a job site basis. We have seen jobs push out to your point because of job site labor constraints. It's not anything that I would spike out and say it's super alarming, but it's certainly there, and it's not just in North America. It's really on a global basis. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. And then, R&D, the missed revenue that you're starting to make up in the fourth quarter. I mean, we've had similar metrics out of some other folks, but with the expectation that just we don't miss any more revenue in 4Q and starting to make it up would imply that not only your maybe some of those supply chain issue stabilizing, but starting to improve., I don't want to put too many words in your mouth, but like would you characterize the last 30 days or so as seeing some actual improvement rather than just stability? David Regnery : Yes. I mean, we had some acute supplier problems in our Thermo King business and we've been able to overcome those. So we are -- we have line of sight to what we're guiding to you right now. That said, supply chain is very volatile right now. It is the whack-a-mole game. So we fixed one problem and then other one comes out. But it should really about staying on top of where you are, working with your customers, working with your suppliers. And it's a lot about communication and I would tell you that our operating system allows us to be working hand-in-hand with our suppliers to make sure they can meet the expectations that we're seeing, which again, is extremely robust right now. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, thanks. Good luck working those moles. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : . Good morning. Chris Kuehn : Hi, Andrew. How are you? David Regnery : Good morning Andrew Obin : I'm good. I'm good. Just a bit of a longer-term question. You've highlighted strength on institutional and I think after the first wave of stimulus came in, I think education was very much highlighted as an area, air-quality improvement, etc. which were going to benefit the industry. My understanding is that there is a timeline on spending that money. I think you have to do it over 3 years. Can you just tell us what you have seen so far? And how do you expect the spending to play out over this period of time in the institution of vertical learning  specifically education. Thank you. David Regnery : Yes. We're seeing -- we're seeing funds flow, which is a good thing, 2024 is the date, whereas we spend. That may -- that's the date right now that may get pushed out, obviously, you going to think about any work you're going to do on a school, you're going to do when students aren't there, so you tend to become a quote season to do score. What funds are flowing, the elementary, secondary school relief, emergency relief for ESSER as they have it. It's flowing from the states down to the local levels. And we're seeing really, really good traction where we did a phase one indoor air quality audit. We gave our customer our roadmap for the future, they're now executing to many of those roadmaps with upgrades in their facility. Andrew Obin : Got you. And just a longer-term question on residential as well. You sort of highlighted that it's a GDP plus business. But how should we think about 21 fitting into the overall sort of length of the cycle. Do you think there was any pull forward or do you think just thinking over the next several years, as I said, it just continues to be positive in '22, positive in '23, and just keeps going until consumer gets tired. Just maybe the broader shape, longer-term shape of the resi cycles as you think about it, particularly after a strong '21. Thanks a lot. David Regnery : Well, hopefully the consumer doesn't get tired, but I'm not sure the historical models on the cycles have played out certainly in the past. Again, we look at it as the GDP plus business. We have models that will go through replacement cycles and use of unit etc.. and they have a lot of data on and the rest. But at the end of the day, if you think about as a GDP plus business, you think about consumer confidence, that's what drives that market. And we're very happy with the performance that we've had this year. And GDP will be positive in 2022. Andrew Obin : Great answer. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. David Regnery : Hey Deane. How are you doing? Deane Dray : Doing very well, thank you. Just a question about your CapEx plans and we're hearing from some companies who just are not able to get projects done, also a consequence of supply chain labor constraints and so forth. But you as a customer, is -- are you seeing any of that, and how is that factored into CapEx planning for '21 and '22? David Regnery : Yeah, we have several upgrades that we're doing, actually continuous as we continue to upgrade our lines. We've seen some push out, but nothing that we can't manage. Deane Dray : Okay. Chris Kuehn : I'd add that, we're still tracking again that 1% to 2%, probably closer to 2% this year spend on capital as a percent of revenue. But with enough advance notice and ordering within lead times, we've been able to try to mitigate some of that supply chain pressure. Deane Dray : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up question on the whole whack-a-mole phenomenon is, are you doing much in the way of partial assemblies at your manufacturing plants? You're waiting for a component. And so this would imply, you've got -- you're actually spending on work in progress inventory and then when that product does come in, you ship them out. If it follows through to subsequent quarter, that's actually a higher margin shipments since you've already expensed some of that. How does that factor into your planning right now, are you doing partial assemblies and so forth? David Regnery : The answer to partial assemblies is yes, we could have you come work for us in Operations because that's obviously what's remaining for some components. In some cases, you could do a partial assemblies. In some cases you cannot. But as far as the revenue recognition of the cost, Chris, I don't know if you want to have it, but the answer is no. Chris Kuehn : Yeah. I think if we've got a partial assembly, we can't recognize the revenue. We're capturing all the costs associated with it. It stays in inventory until we ultimately recognize the revenue. The following quarter, we're adding the components we need to on the partial assembly to make it full. And then that's when the full cost gets expensed. Deane Dray : Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you. David Regnery : You're welcome. Operator : Your final question comes from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Stephen Volkmann : Hi. Thanks guys for squeezing me in. Most of my questions have been answered, but maybe a big picture question for you, Dave. I'm wondering, sort of the old model that we had in this industry of trying to keep inventories as lean as possible and so forth. It worked well for a slower gross environment, but it feels like we're still transitioning into something better than that. So I wonder, do you need some more capacity? Does it make sense to layer in some more inventory on structural basis to deal with a stronger growth environment? David Regnery : Yes. It is an excellent question and obviously we pride ourselves in being a lean Company. And maybe that's why we were out talking about supply chain choppiness in the second quarter ahead of many others, because we saw it in our planning horizons. That said, we have capacity for sure, but the inventory investment is something that we're working with internally and an inventory don't think of it necessarily as finished goods. Maybe you would in the resi business, but in our Commercial business, it's really at the raw level where you're able to convert it more easily into WIP and then finished goods. Stephen Volkmann : Super. Great. And then just anything else that you've thought about over the last few months, as you've taken on this role that might differentiate you a little bit from your predecessor? David Regnery : Yes. It's been -- I don't know. It's been a 150 days. It feels like forever, but this is just such a great Company, Trane Technologies. And we have -- and we are a part of such a great industry. So I couldn't be prouder to be the CEO of Trane Technologies. We're talking -- I'm talking next week at COP26, talking about a way for the next rate invention to starting to de -carbonizing the world decent benches already exist today. So I'm excited to do that. And then the only thing I would add is we just completed our employee engagement survey. And here we are. I don't know how many years in this. But top decile performance for engagement is our culture that differentiates us and not sure that's going to differentiate between me and my, but it is really our culture and how much pride we'd taken to building a strong culture. So Trane Technologies is in a great place today and it's -- we're headed in an even better place in the future, but thanks for the -- thanks for the question. Stephen Volkmann : Great. I appreciate. All the best. David Regnery : Thank you. Operator : This ends the question-and-answer session for today's call. I will now turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for any additional or closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Thanks, Paula. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As always, we'll be available in the coming days and weeks to answer any questions that you may have. And hopefully we will see you in person on the road in the not-too-distant future. Have a great day. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's call. This does conclude today's event. You may now disconnect.",

Joining me on today\u2019s call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Zac, and everyone, for joining us on today\u2019s call. Let\u2019s turn to Slide #3. Today, I'd like to open with a few comments on our purpose-driven sustainability strategy, which is the engine that enables us to deliver differentiated shareholder returns over time. Secular sustainability megatrends continue to intensify. Climate change is causing more extreme weather events, which threaten vulnerable people and economies around the world. Scientists say, it is still possible to meet the targets set under the Paris Agreement, but it is getting more difficult as time passes. We need to act today. And that's what Trane Technologies is doing. We have set aggressive science-based emission reduction targets that continue to push our innovation further and faster. That innovation is transforming the way the world heats and cools buildings, improves indoor air quality and safely transports food and medicine. As we scale today's technology and innovate for tomorrow, we can dramatically reduce emissions and accelerate the world's progress. We are committed to making a difference relentlessly and over the long-term. This unyielding approach enables us to consistently outgrow our end markets, which in turn, helps us drive strong margin and powerful free cash flow to deploy through our balanced capital allocation strategy. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our customers, for our team, for our shareholders and for the planet. Moving to Slide #4. Our global team delivered a strong close to 2021 despite persistent macro challenges related to cost inflation, tight supply chains and logistics markets and labor availability that continue to restrict capacity and negatively impact productivity. In the fourth quarter, we delivered 27% bookings growth, 11% organic revenue growth and 32% adjusted EPS growth. This includes approximately $80 million of $150 million of revenue that was pushed out of the third quarter, which was at the high-end of our guidance range of $50 million to $75 million. On balance, 2021 was another very strong year for us with record performance across key financial metrics. Bookings, revenue, backlog, EBITDA margins and adjusted EPS all hit record levels. Price realization also reached record levels, demonstrating the power of our business operating system and enabling us to more than neutralize the impact of widespread and persistent inflation for the year. With record demand for our innovative products and services and backlog nearly double the level it was at this time last year, we are extremely well positioned for 2022 and beyond. We anticipate macro challenges to continue to constrain capacity and to negatively impact productivity and those impacts are reflected in our revenue and EPS guidance. They are also reflected in how we're thinking about the cadence of the year, with the second half expected to be much stronger than the first half. With continued strong demand and supply constrained by the macro environment, we expect backlog to remain at elevated levels throughout 2022 and into 2023. Please turn to Slide #5. Looking at our initial guidance for 2021, we effectively met or exceeded all of our targets and delivered another year of strong financial performance. We delivered 11% organic revenue growth, 140 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 37% adjusted EPS growth. We also delivered strong free cash flow and returned $1.7 billion in capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Please turn to Slide #6. Our relentless investments in innovation and our unwavering focus on serving our customers enables us to deliver consistently strong performance and differentiated returns for our shareholders over the long-term. Demand for sustainable solutions continues to accelerate, and our innovation leadership is positioning us to outperform end markets. This will only intensify as the world decarbonizes. We're confident our leadership in sustainable innovation will continue to deliver differentiated financial performance and shareholder returns into the future. Please turn to Slide #7. In addition to our financial metrics, our ESG performance is core to our purpose and our strategy. Beginning in 2021, we revised our annual incentive compensation plan for approximately 2,300 leaders to link directly to ESG metrics, including reducing carbon emissions and increasing the diversity of our workforce. These metrics are on our glide path to achieving our 2030 sustainability commitments. And I am happy to report that we exceeded each milestone in 2021, job well done by the team. Please turn to Slide #8. Customer demand for our climate-focused innovation continues to grow. We delivered another quarter of robust organic bookings growth, with growth across all segments. Customer demand was high throughout 2021 with organic bookings up 27% for both the quarter and the year, driving record backlog in each segment entering 2022. Organic revenues were also strong, up 11% for the quarter and the year. Overall, bookings growth far exceeded revenue growth, which was in part constrained by global supply chain and other macro challenges referenced earlier. Our Americas Commercial HVAC business delivered robust bookings growth in the quarter with orders up mid-20s. Strength was broad-based with applied, unitary and service each up more than 20%. Demand for comprehensive end-to-end indoor air quality solutions remained strong and contributed to high single-digit organic revenue growth in Commercial HVAC Americas. The residential HVAC markets also remained strong, and our residential HVAC team delivered bookings growth over 30%. Revenues were up mid- to high-teens in the quarter, adding to growth of more than 20% in the fourth quarter of 2020. Sell-through across our channels was also strong, up high-teens. With full year organic bookings up over 70% and full year organic revenues up over 30%, our Americas transport refrigeration business significantly outperformed the North America transport markets. During the fourth quarter, we extended our 2022 order book through the third quarter of 2022, which contributed to bookings growth of more than 40%. We continue to thoughtfully manage our 2022 order book in order to mitigate inflationary risks. Fourth quarter organic revenue growth was consistent with full year growth, up 30%. Turning to EMEA, we continue to see strong demand for our innovative products and services that help reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for our customers. Our EMEA teams delivered 13% organic bookings growth in the quarter, with strong growth in both commercial HVAC and transport refrigeration. With full year organic bookings up over 40% and full year organic revenues up over 20%, our EMEA transport refrigeration business significantly outperformed the markets in 2021. During the quarter, EMEA transport refrigeration bookings and revenues were both up high-teens. Our Asia Pacific team delivered strong bookings growth of 18% and revenue growth of 4%, supported by broad-based growth in China and across the region. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #9. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was driven by both strong volume and continued strong price execution of over 5% incremental price. Turning to margins. Price over material inflation was modestly positive in the quarter, capping full year positive price/cost. Productivity was significantly impacted by continued supply chain, logistics and labor availability challenges, which were exacerbated in recent weeks with the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. In addition, we continue to make strong incremental business reinvestments. Net adjusted EBITDA and operating margins improved 30 and 10 basis points, respectively. Adjusted EPS grew 32%, driven primarily from the higher adjusted operating income. Please turn to Slide #10. We discussed the key revenue and margin dynamics for the enterprise on the prior page. The dynamics impacting revenue and margins were similar across each of our business segments, as we've highlighted here, with strong price realization, incremental business reinvestments and innovation, and macro challenges impacting productivity and cost inflation as consistent drivers. Both the Americas and EMEA segments delivered higher revenues with modest margin declines. Margins were impacted by the macro challenges we've outlined. For the full year, both Americas and EMEA segments delivered strong margin expansion with EBITDA margins expanding 100 basis points and 240 basis points, respectively. Our Asia Pacific segment delivered good leverage and margin expansion in the quarter with EBITDA margins expanding 170 basis points for the full year. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide #11. Commercial HVAC Americas has significantly outperformed the broader markets over a number of years through relentless innovation for our customers. Our unwavering focus on solving our customers' most complex problems, compounded by the strength in underlying market conditions, powered the business forward in 2021 and yielded record backlog entering 2022. End markets continue to improve with a multitude of economic indicators pointing to growth in 2022. GDP forecast remains strong. Unemployment is low, and indicators like Architectural Billing Index, which has been over 50 since February, remained largely favorable. Demand remains strong in data center, warehouse, education, and healthcare. We're benefiting from increased demand across our K-12 customers with federal stimulus funds supporting both current and future growth. We see this as a multi-year tailwind for our business, given our strong position in the education market and our direct sales force with deep relationships in this vertical. Demand for our residential products was unprecedented in 2021, contributing to record revenue. Looking at 2022, we see tailwinds from record backlog entering the year and expect strong price realization. And, we see headwinds from lapping tough growth compares from 2021. I'm proud of our residential team that has continued to meet customer demand while ramping capacity after a February weather event in our Texas facility. The team remains on track for capacity expansion in advance of the 2022 cooling season. Turning to Americas transport. We significantly outgrew strong end markets in 2021, as we outlined earlier. ACT continues to project continued market growth through their forecast horizon of 2023. I'll talk more about the transport outlook in our topics of interest section. Turning to EMEA. While we have muted expectations for market growth, Demand for our sustainability-focused systems and services remain strong, and we continue to see good opportunities for market outgrowth. Our transport refrigeration business significantly outgrew end markets, delivering over 20% full year revenue growth as compared to 13% market growth in the region. Turning to Asia. We expect growth in China in 2022, supported by strength in data center, electronics, pharmaceutical and health care. Outside of China, the picture is mixed with COVID-related partial lockdowns still impacting market expansion in some countries. Our direct sales force model is differentiated in the region, and provides good opportunities for market outgrowth in equipment and services. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris to outline our guidance for 2022. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #12. Based on the market backdrop Dave just outlined and our strong backlog entering the year, we expect to deliver strong financial performance in 2022, with high single-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS between $6.95 and $7.15. Our operating leverage outlook of approximately 20%, contemplates a stronger second half with improving macro dynamics, particularly around inflation and an improving supply chain. We expect price/cost to be slightly positive for the year, but negative through the first half, as we lap strong price and more modest inflation from the first half of 2021. The macro environment remains dynamic, and we expect tight supply chains, logistics and labor availability to restrain revenue growth and margins, especially in the first half of the year. We expect free cash flow to remain strong and equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net income. Our outlook includes capital expenditures of approximately 2% of revenues, which is at the high end of our typical 1% to 2% range. Relentless incremental business reinvestment is never episodic for us, and it's how we innovate ahead of the competition year after year. Entering 2022, we are planning incremental investments in high ROI projects in support of our profitable growth objectives and our 2030 sustainability commitments. These high ROI projects include manufacturing automation, supply chain resiliency, as well as investments to further decarbonize our operations. Our free cash flow outlook also includes modest investment in working capital, with particular focus on strategic inventory to support continued growth. Given inherent challenges in accurately forecasting FX rates and the fact that we're transparent about our organic bookings and revenue each quarter, our guidance excludes potential FX impacts. Our FX exposure is largely translational in nature and each point of revenue would translate at approximately OI rates. Net, as a reference, each point of negative FX would translate into about $0.05 of EPS headwind. Please turn to Slide #13. While we traditionally provide annual guidance, given the dynamic macroeconomic environment, we believe it may be constructive to provide an outlook for the first quarter based on what we expect to see today. Based on backlog, orders and the dynamic macro backdrop we've outlined, we currently expect organic revenues to grow in the low to mid-single-digit range, with flattish unit volumes and strong price realization. First quarter margins are expected to be challenged due to negative incremental price cost dynamics, considering very strong price versus cost in the first quarter of 2021. You'll recall, we were able to get well ahead of inflation in the first quarter, with strong price realization, which was part of the reason we were able to deliver very high operating leverage of nearly 50% in Q1 of 2021. Inflation was relatively modest in the first quarter of 2021 and really began to ramp aggressively in the third and fourth quarters. We exited Q4 with peak price and peak cost for 2021, with price at unprecedented levels of more than 5%. Net, while we expect to carry over strong pricing from the fourth quarter of 2021 into the first quarter of 2022, we're also lapping strong price from Q1 of 2021, which dampens the incremental carryover price. Likewise, we expect to carry over peak inflation from the fourth quarter of 2021 into the first quarter of 2022 but to lap more modest inflation from the first quarter of 2021. The equation is a bit more complex than this. But to keep it simple, this essentially means that we'll see almost the full impact of the carryover inflation. The end result is we expect to be upside down on price/cost in the first quarter by $30 million to $40 million. This pricing dynamic improves as we move through 2022 and additional pricing actions taken in 2022 come online and are realized. As we've outlined, macro challenges related to supply chain, tight logistics and labor constraints exacerbated by the Omicron variant are expected to negatively impact productivity. While it's difficult to predict the negative impact on productivity in a very dynamic environment, we expect a considerable impact in the first quarter. All in, our outlook is for adjusted operating income to be down approximately $35 million year-over-year in Q1, as we work to balance all the pieces. As we discussed on the prior slide, our full-year outlook contemplates a stronger second half with easing inflation and an improving macro environment. We'll update this outlook as the year goes along. There are a couple of items for Q1 that I also wanted to highlight to help with your models. First, interest expense is expected to be approximately $56 million, reflecting 2021 debt retirements. The other item I'd highlight is the estimated Q1 adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 17%, which we've assumed is flat with 2021. The Q1 tax rate is traditionally low, impacted by higher stock-based compensation in the quarter. The full-year 2021 guidance remains 19% to 20%. Please go to Slide number14. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023. Importantly, we continue to invest these cost savings in high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio as discussed earlier. Please go to Slide #15. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide 16, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment in 2021 and our outlook for 2022. During 2021, we deployed $2.4 billion in cash with approximately $1.4 billion to M&A and share repurchases. We paid $561 million in dividends and $425 million to pay down debt. Looking to 2022, we expect to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash, inclusive of $350 million in share repurchases we executed in January of 2022. Our outlook also includes our announcement that we intend to raise the quarterly dividend to $2.68 per share annualized. When combined with the dividend increase of 11% in 2021, the annual dividend is expected to be up 26% since launching as a pure-play climate control business in March 2020. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality and dry powder moving forward. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please go to Slide #18. I'd like spend a couple of minutes providing an update on the transport refrigeration markets. Both Americas and EMEA had robust market growth in 2021, and our Thermo King businesses thrived. We pushed through macro challenges and significantly outgrew the markets in both regions. On the left side of the slide, you can see that the North America trailer truck and APU markets combined grew 19%, while Thermo King Americas grew more than 30%. In EMEA, market growth for trailer and truck combined was 17%, while Thermo King EMEA also grew more than 30%. On the right side of the slide in the highlighted box, you can see that the total weighted average market growth for the Americas and EMEA transport refrigeration markets in 2021 was 15% and 13%, respectively. Thermo King growth for the Americas and EMEA was more than 30% and more than 20%, respectively. We're extremely pleased with the tremendous market outgrowth each of these businesses delivered in 2021. Market projections for 2023 call for continued growth in both regions, with particular strength continuing in North America. There's one other important dynamic I'd like to highlight while we're discussing transport refrigeration and moving into 2022. Our teams delivered tremendous booking growth in both regions in 2021, as we discussed on Slide 8. Our bookings growth was more than twice our revenue growth, even as our revenue growth far exceeded the growth of our end markets, resulting in record backlogs. Net, we expect this dynamic to result in bookings declines during the year as we work through backlog extending well into 2022 and go up against tough compares every quarter. We'll highlight these dynamics with our earnings calls for transparency as we move through 2022. Please go to Slide #19. We added a second transport refrigeration slide to the deck last quarter to add more color around the North America trailer market from both backward and forward-looking perspectives. We're not going to spend a lot of time on it today, but we think it's a helpful reference slide for additional transparency. ACT continues to call for a nine-year average for North America trailers in the mid-40,000-unit range through 2023, with the pandemic in 2020 being the only significant outlier. Please go to Slide #20. Energy efficiency, decarbonization and sustainability megatrends are only growing stronger. We are uniquely positioned to deliver leading innovation that addresses these trends and accelerates the world's progress, supported by our business transformation and our engaging uplifting culture. Despite a number of persistent macro challenges, 2021 was a record year for us with top quartile EPS growth accompanied by strong free cash flow and balanced capital deployment. We're seeing unprecedented levels of demand for our products and services and our backlog has never been stronger. We're executing our business operating system well and expect to continue to successfully navigate macro challenges with a customer-first mindset. We believe we have the fundamental ingredients to deliver strong performance across the board in 2022 and beyond and to continue to drive differentiated shareholder returns over the long-term. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions, Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hi. Good morning, guys. Dave Regnery : Hi Andy. How are you doing? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Good. How are you? Dave Regnery : Great. Andy Kaplowitz : Dave or Chris, can you give us more color into how you're thinking about Trane's ability to offset other inflation outside of material cost with productivity? Because that seemed to be a big swing factor in terms of margin headwind in Q4 and it obviously is pressuring Q1 in 2022. So how much was the impact on Q4? What's the impact in Q1? I assume you're baking in the additional headwinds on labor from Omicron over the last few weeks into Q1. And how are you thinking about that for 2022? Chris Kuehn : Yeah, I'll start, Andy. So I think going into the fourth quarter, we continue to see challenges on the supply chain front in terms of driving spot buys, inefficiencies in our plant and factory operations. And with our Q4 guide of leverage around mid-teens, we really kind of landed right around that guide. I think leverage in the quarter was around 14%. So we landed right where we thought we would land. In the fourth quarter, we saw a little bit more price on the realization side. We saw a little bit more inflation as well in the fourth quarter as those both continue to ramp. But we did see negative productivity over other inflation in the fourth quarter. And we're anticipating that for the first half of 2022 as well. The supply chain constraints are real. We're managing through them, day-by-day, week-by-week. And right now, what we see right now is the second half of the year looks to be stronger in terms of supply chain resiliency and ultimately getting some of the supply chain back on track. But it's a balance we're working each and every day. Dave Regnery : Yeah. Andy, the only thing I would add is that, in our plants right now with the supply chain constraints, and I could talk more about that after, it's very, very disruptive, okay? So if you were a plant manager you ever had the opportunity to be a plant manager, anyone on the line, you'd know what I was talking about. We're constantly having to reschedule, rebalance lines, we're pulling line-side inventory and replacing it with other line-side inventory, rescheduling employees. So this is a plant manager kind of nightmare. And the good thing is we have great plant managers, and we're working through it. But it is disruptive. It's been for - disruptive for some time now. And as Chris said, we anticipate this disruption to continue certainly through the first quarter and the first half. Andy Kaplowitz : Helpful, guys. And then Dave, I think you mentioned before that you expect your resi HVAC business to be a GDP-plus business going forward and in 2022. I think with resi bookings still up 30% in Q4, capacity up, strong pricing, I know you talked about tough comps. How are you thinking about the business in 2022? Does it have the potential to grow in line with the company or how are you viewing inventory in the channel at this point? DaveRegnery: Yeah. Great question, Andy. We do see our resi business, over time, being a GDP-plus business. And I'd just remind everyone that our resi business is about 20% of our total business. And we did -- we had a very strong fourth quarter. I mean, revenue in the fourth quarter for our resi business was up 17%, 17%, and our bookings were up over 30%. So the resi business is performing well. I'm really proud of what that team has been able to do, ramping up the facility in Tyler, Texas after a freak weather event. And just the customer mindset there and the ability for them to ramp up and serve the customers, some of the best I've seen in our company. As far as the resi markets go, you're going to see -- we'll see growth in new construction, which is a smaller portion of our business. And we don't expect the replacement market, which is the larger part of our business, to fall off a cliff. So our resi business will be up against tough comps, as you said, all year. With that said, we have a strong backlog, market-leading brands and we'll see strong price all year. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that, guys. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Andy. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Andy. Operator : The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Dave Regnery : Hi, Julian, how are you? Julian Mitchell : Good. Thank you. Very good. Maybe just wanted to circle back on the sort of EPS seasonality through the year. You gave very clear Q1 guidance and I say as the Q1 worked out to being around the low-teens share of the full year earnings, so not too different versus history. But you kept emphasizing a sort of challenging first half. So when we think about the first half, should we assume it's around the sort of mid-40s share of full year earnings? Is that roughly the right ballpark with sort of price/cost getting a little bit less bad in Q2? Chris Kuehn : Hey, Julian, it's Chris. I'll start. Yeah, first quarter, where we're dialing in the guide around $0.95 to $1, that would put it around 14% to the full year. So Q1 would be around 14% versus the full year at the midpoint. That's actually a little better than what our average has been over the last four to five years. That average is around 12%. So we're seeing it to be a little bit stronger on the full year. But I think it's hard to tell what we think the second quarter will fully be at this point. We continue to work the supply chain challenges. And as we see it, this is not a demand concern. The demand is absolutely there. This is really a supply chain and how do we navigate through it. So we'll provide some more guidance when we get through our first quarter call and what we think for Q2. But we definitely see from the supply chain aspects, the second half of the year is easing in terms of supply, logistics and some of the labor constraints as well. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. Thank you. And then, just my second one around commercial HVAC revenue trends in 2022. Should we think about the Americas having kind of the strongest growth of the three regions in commercial HVAC this year? And maybe any color on how you see the new construction market in non-resi in the U.S. this year. Dave Regnery : Yes. Julian, how are you doing? This is Dave. Look, our commercial business performed very well in the Americas all year in 2021, with broad-based strength in Q4 across unitary, applied and service, all of them were up over 20%. So, the team is seeing tremendous demand. As far as the end markets go, you have low unemployment, you have strong underlying GDP growth, ABI has been positive for the last 11 months, which are above 50, which means positive. And again, that's a six to nine-month lag on that metric, so that's a good foreshadowing as to what to expect in the future. We have particularly strong strength in the data centers vertical, warehousing, healthcare, education. We're starting to see nice growth in the office vertical. Indoor air quality and decarbonization of the built environment will continue to be tailwinds for us. So, we'll have a strong year in our commercial HVAC business, and we have some nice tailwinds behind us and that business will continue to execute. Our constraint there will not be the markets. It will be back to the supply chain. And specifically in the first half, as we're starting to get some visibility into the second half, some of those supply constraints, specifically around electronic components, will start to ease. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Thanks. ChrisKuehn: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey. Good morning, guys. Dave Regnery : Hey, Josh. How you\u2019re doing? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Well, thanks. Just wondering what got worse on the inflation front sequentially 4Q to 1Q. I know like some of the metals are sort of rolling off. There's probably an inventory dynamic that gets in the way in realizing that near term. But putting aside kind of the year-over-year journey of the math, like, it sounds like things actually got maybe a little bit worse. Like anything you call out specifically that we should be kind of watching more closely? Chris Kuehn : Hey, Josh. It's Chris. Yes, in the fourth quarter, I would say price was a little better than where we started the quarter and also inflation wound up being a little higher as well. Part of this is the inefficiencies we're seeing around spot buys and expedited freight to ultimately serve customers. But as I think carrying over Q4 into Q1, we're seeing roughly the same levels of inflation in the fourth quarter carrying over into the first quarter. You may recall, we look at commodities and have a hedging practice and strategy in place for copper and aluminum, which will roll out really over 12 months but it really smooths the impact of inflation. Going into any one quarter, we'd have about 70%, 75% of that price already hedged. So, I would say the impacts of the fourth quarter really start to be very similar to the impacts in the first quarter there. Steel, roughly the same way. We have about a six-month lag on our steel purchasing from when we lock in prices to when we would see any price changes. So any dynamics now in January, we're seeing in steel would really be realized in the second half of the year. So, that's how we're kind of playing out from Q4 to Q1. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then, just on the commercial side, we've had some of these kind of broader market initiatives in your own, whether it's indoor air quality or some of the more sustainability-focused products. Really been out there in the marketplace for a while now and customers taking hold. What are you guys watching today to kind of track that in earnest and maybe disaggregate normal replacement type demand in commercial from some of the spicier stuff you guys have put out over the past couple of years? Dave Regnery : Yes. Good question, Josh. I mean first of all, I'll start with IAQ, right? IAQ, Indoor Air Quality, we continue to see a tailwind from that. We had a very good year in 2021. We expect to have another good year in 2022. Still getting a lot of demand out there for indoor air quality audits, as well as what we call day two activity, which is helping our customers build out the infrastructure for long-term improvements with an energy consumption in line of sight there. As far as decarbonization of the built environment, as we call it, we're in the very, very early innings. And the intention there is growing every day. We've talked a lot about what we're doing in Europe there with the electrification of heating and that is again, just to remind everyone, it's really not just a heat pump. It's a system that's combining a chiller and a boiler plant together into one system. That is -- we're not only seeing great traction in Europe there, we're also seeing that in the Americas. So, those are in the early innings. And we track activity for both, Indoor Air Quality as well as on decarbonization pretty closely. It's getting harder to blend the two together. So those are going to continue. And then you have the core business that kind of is going to follow what we would say, the more traditional, right? We obviously look at what's happening with new construction and Dodge is still actively forecasting pretty robust demand in 2022. So that's a good sign. And as I said earlier, Architectural Billing Index is probably one of the -- has probably some of the highest correlation of what the future is going to be for our commercial HVAC business, and that's been over 50 now for 11 months. So, that bodes well for the future as well. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Hey thanks. Good morning everyone. Dave Regnery : Jeff, did you survive the storm up in Connecticut? Jeff Sprague : I did. All good up here. Putting the four-wheelers to work. Dave Regnery : Unfortunately, we had to use some four-wheelers here in Charlotte, too, so\u2026 Jeff Sprague : Yes, I'm sure it's a little scary on the roads down there. We know how to drive up here though. Dave, I think kind of implicit in you acknowledging the orders will roll down now on the comps and the like, right, would also then obviously suggest that people have ordered further out to get their place in line and that sort of thing. And really, the nature of my question is, to what extent were people able to place orders in advance of your price increases? Or have you been able to fully protect yourself on kind of the costs coming through the inventory channel and the backlog? Dave Regnery : Yeah, it\u2019s a good question for sure. And the first one, let me start with the order rates, okay? So, for many of our products, we do have extended lead times right now. So we do have order -- customers that are ordering early by definition. I would also tell you that, we\u2019re working very closely with our customers and they want to give us as much visibility as possible. So there's certainly -- they understand what's happening with supply chain. So they're asking us to make sure that we got spot secured for them in the future. So I would say, we are getting orders in earlier. You see that in our robust bookings numbers. I wouldn't get overly concerned with it. It's not like we're pulling in orders from 1.5 years out, okay? We're talking a few months here. As far as pricing is concerned in the backlog, at the end of the day, you really have to go through it by business. And in our resi business, for example, we repriced the backlog. So if we have a price increase, we'll reprice the backlog. In our commercial business, some of our orders actually have price elasticity built into those based on certain indices. So depending on when it's going to ship, we'll actually be -- it will be at a higher price vis-\u00e0-vis if it's shipped today. And that's normal, and we've been doing that for a long time. So the days of, there's going to be a price increase, let me double-order or order as much as I can to get in front of it. I think we've -- I mean, that certainly happens a little bit. A lot of that behavior has been changed. Jeff Sprague : And Dave, can you provide a little bit more color on how you think resi plays out, right? You said you don't envision it falling off a cliff. But how do you see it playing? And is there maybe some gamesmanship around the efficiency change? You just said people don't pre-buy anymore so perhaps you're not expecting that. But just kind of the overall trajectory of resi as you see it over the course of the year here. Dave Regnery : Yes. I do -- as far as the pre-buy for the regulation change and efficiency change in 2022, there could be some of that activity. We don't see it to be anything alarming. It would obviously -- we'll update everyone as we see that starting to unfold as the year goes forward. As far as the end markets go in resi, 2021 was a very robust year. Fourth quarter was very strong for us. So I'm very encouraged with order rates up over 30% in the fourth quarter.  Residential new construction, as I said earlier, it will be positive, right? I mean, there's a lot of metrics out around that. So that will probably be in the low single digits positive, although that's a small percentage of our business, about 20%. The replacement market, about 80% of our business, we don't see it falling off a cliff, okay? Could unit volume be down 1 point or 2 point? Sure. But I also would tell you that we're going to see strong price all year in resi. Jeff Sprague : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Sure. Operator : The next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open.. Scott Davis : Good \u2013 Good morning, guys. Dave Regnery : Hi, Scott. How are you? Scott Davis : I\u2019m great. Thank you. I'm kind of curious, just following up on Jeff's question. I mean, the -- in new construction, it was always the builders would buy kind of the cheapest unit out there. Is there a change in some buying patterns? Are guys buying higher efficiency and trying to sell the environmental benefits and stuff like that? Are they able to capture any value on the homebuilding side if they upgrade? Or is it still kind of similar as the past? Dave Regnery : Yes, it's a great question. Again, it's a smaller part of our business, only about 20%. And we certainly talk to many of the homebuilders, many of the large homebuilders and what you just described, they're very interested in, we'll see if they act on that. But they're very interested conceptually on being able to have a greener home, for lack of better terms, and being able to sell that to \u2013 to their customer. Because we're so small, I'd be hard to \u2013 where we're selling, we sell some high into that market, but it'd be interesting to see some of the larger players actually act on what they talk a lot about. Scott Davis : Okay. And then Dave, back to kind of the common question we're getting right now from folks is just about the integrity of backlogs, and historically, the larger the down payment, the higher the integrity of the backlog. But has the dynamic changed with the customer base at all? Can you capture more upfront to get people and kind of secure them spots in line that perhaps capture a little bit of a premium on the supply and demand imbalance that's occurring right now? Dave Regnery : Yeah. I mean, at the end of the day, we think the integrity of our backlog is quite strong, okay? And let me tell you why. In our resi business with our independent wholesale distributors, technically, they can't cancel orders. So we don't see that backlog going away. We do see a small amount of maybe double ordering from dealers, but it's insignificant in respect to a $5.4 billion backlog. In commercial HVAC, we're dealing with complex systems and highly engineered products and working closely with engineers and architects and end customers. And you don't see a job site delay, but you're not going to see duplicate orders. And in Thermo King, we're working closely with our customers, and we're matching their demand with other OEMs, whether it be on the trailer side or the tractor side. And we're \u2013 all of us are working together to make sure that we could combine the solution for the customer and everything gets through at the same time. So we don't see those orders being canceled as well. So overall, we think the backlog is strong. As far as your question about demanding more money upfront, we're not doing that in the \u2013 certainly in the Americas or in EMEA. That has always been a practice in parts of Asia, which we do. But we're not going out and demanding cash from our customers, because of the incredible amount of demand that we're seeing. We don't \u2013 that's not what Trane Technologies is about. We want to solve our customers' most complex problems and work with them, and that's what we'll continue to do in the future. Scott Davis : Sounds good Dave. Good luck. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it. Operator : The next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Dave Regnery : Hey, Joe. How are you? Joe Ritchie : All good. Thanks, Dave. So just \u2013 maybe we'll start off on this price/cost question for Chris. The $30 million to $40 million headwind in 1Q, whatever details you can give us on how that's supposed to look for the rest of the quarters throughout the year. And then specifically on pricing, I'm just curious like what are you baking in for resi pricing in 2022? Chris Kuehn : Yeah, hey, Joe. So I mean, I'll start with the second question first. So on pricing, just to remind you, we had about three price increases across the majority of our portfolio in 2021, really an unprecedented level of price. And on a full year basis it's three and a half points of price at the enterprise level across the company. So really very, very strong. We are \u2013 have announced and in place what I'll call the first price increase of 2022 that really started here in January, and that applied to the majority of our products. So it's based on the inflation that we see today and as nimble as we were last year and I think we saw the industry follow, we're going to remain nimble as we go through the year as we kind of evaluate inflation. On the price/cost dynamic, exactly, we're carrying over significant price from the fourth quarter into Q1. We're carrying over a significant level of inflation that nearly offset the price in the fourth quarter. We were slightly price/cost positive in Q4. And we see that right now being a negative in the first quarter and likely negative on the first half. Again, in the first quarter last year, we saw a very strong price. We got ahead of the marketing competition in terms of the timing of our price announcements. And we had some very modest inflation in the first quarter last year. So that helped drive the near 50% leverage in the first quarter a year ago. So we're going to, unfortunately, lap against very modest inflation in Q1. We see inflation for the year, it's really a mirror image of 2021, 2022 is. The first half of 2022 is going to look a lot like the second half of 2021 in terms of the inflation. And then we start comping in the second half of the year to a much more modest inflation or comparable inflation starting in the third quarter. So, I think right now, our best view is we're probably price/cost negative in the first half, and then it returns to really very good strength in the second half of the year and strong leverage. Joe Ritchie : And Chris, maybe just following up on that point in the second half. We've talked about inflation, but how are you guys thinking about cost curves coming down in the second half? And are you baking in deflation into your numbers in 2H, as part of the guide? Chris Kuehn : Yeah, I'd say we're not baking a whole lot of deflation into the guide, Joe, to be fair. I mean, I look at copper and aluminum futures and they're pretty narrow from now until the balance of the year. So I don't see a lot of deflation there. What's starting to show a bit of deflationary impacts is steel. Let's see where it goes. But at this point, if we start seeing deflation there, that would really impact us starting six months out from today just based on our buying habits and our locking in a steel price for six months. So if it turns out we start seeing a deflationary environment, which we're not counting on, but if we start to see that, then we'll see how that plays out in the second half of the year, but that could be a tailwind then. Joe Ritchie : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Joe. Chris Kuehn : Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is open. Joel Tiss : Hi guys. How's it going? Dave Regnery : Hey Joel, How are you? Congratulations. Joel Tiss : Thanks. Dave Regnery : I hear the retirement \u2026 Joel Tiss : Thank you. Dave Regnery : \u2026is in your future. Congratulations, and thanks for all your great coverage of Trane Technologies/Ingersoll-Rand through the years. We certainly appreciate. And we'll miss you. Joel Tiss : Yeah. Well, let me see if I'm going to be any good at it or not. Dave Regnery : We'll get you some fishing rods, okay? Joel Tiss : Yeah, there you go. And just two longer-term kind of questions, I wonder if you can talk a little bit about any factors kind of, I don't know, being the new guy and all that kind of stuff. And looking over the next five years or so, like, what are the factors you see that could really cap the upside on your operating and your EBITDA margins? Like what do you have to work on today, to make sure that there's no bottleneck five years out? Dave Regnery : Yeah. Joe, it's a great question. And it really has to do with ensuring that you're continuously investing in innovation for the long-term. And you heard Chris talk a little about it. Even though we know the first half of this year is going to be tough, right, we're going to struggle through supply chain constraints. We got a mirror image hitting us with inflation. We'll have strong price but we'll have some carryover strong price as well. So we know the first half will be tough. What we're not going to do in the first half is we're not going to cut our investments because we know that's about our long term. And really where we see this is the whole decarbonization of what's happening and our products about making this world a better place for next generations, that's our purpose. That's what we're committed to, and you're going to continue to see that from Trane Technologies. I had a call the other day with some ESG investors, and they asked me what I was most proud of for ESG for Trane Technologies. I thought about it for a minute, caught me a little bit off-guard, and I was like, 'I'm proud of the fact that Trane Technologies was green before it was cool to be green. And we've been working at this for a long time. Since 2013, we had our first set of science-based targets. We now have our second base of science -- second set of science-based targets. And we are committed to making a difference and we're going to do that through our innovation. We're challenging what's possible, and it's going to be a tremendous upside for Trane Technologies over the long term. Joel Tiss : And then last, can you just give us a little sense of maybe it's a little -- kind of a little far out there also, but what are the impacts on the transport business from trucks turning to EV? Dave Regnery : Yeah. Electrification is a big part of our strategy there, Joel. So you're again -- once again, you're on top of your game there. So yeah, we're -- we have -- in fact, we have a couple -- or a unit that's going up and down the highways. If you're in California, you may see it. That is a trailer unit that is 100% electric. And so we have a lot of really neat innovation we're working on there. Our customers are loving it. The data that we've been able to extract from the unit that's going up and down the highway is tremendous for our engineers to continue to develop and -- anyway, it's -- think about EV vehicles, think about Thermo King as, once again, staying ahead of the market there with electrification of our products. We have some really neat products that we came out with about, I guess, it was 18 months ago now in the home delivery, and we're getting a lot of traction, a lot of tractions around the globe with those products. Joel Tiss : All right. Thank you very much. Dave Regnery : All right. Joel. Good luck to you, okay. Joel Tiss : Congratulations. Operator : The next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Pat on for Steve. I had a -- my first one is on the commercial HVAC business. Can you break down your organic growth expectations for this year between what you expect for services versus equipment? And then within that equipment piece, unitary versus global pod, if possible? Chris Kuehn : Hey, Pat, it's Chris. I'll start. Look, we expect strong growth, equipment and services on a full year basis. As we've talked in the past, applied orders and installed base drives a nice service tailwind. And just given our orders and backlog that we have in 2021 carrying over into 2022, we expect the services business to grow as well. So I'd leave it at that for now. We'll kind of update as we go quarter-by-quarter, which we typically do to highlight the growth in each of the categories. But we've got some good growth plan for both this year. Dave Regnery : The other thing I would add, Pat, this is Dave, is our service business performed very well all year in 2021. And in the fourth quarter, order rates for services were up over 20%. And I don't expect it to grow at 20%, but we've seen very, very nice growth for our service business. Really not just in commercial HVAC but in our commercial HVAC on a global basis, nice service growth. And a lot of that is on intelligent services as well, and this would be with our connected solutions. And so that side of the business is growing very nicely for us. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. I had to try. And then on the first quarter and first half versus second half dynamics, I may have missed this, but did you say if any particular end market drives the slow start in volume growth? And in resi specifically, do you think there's going to be much difference between first half versus second half growth dynamics? Dave Regnery : Yes. I don't -- just to be clear, right, the first half that what's constraining growth in the first half isn't the end markets, it's the supply chain. And specifically, it's components within the supply chain, which is really around electronics. So, it's not end markets. As you see through the fourth quarter, our end markets continued to accelerate, so -- which is a good sign. I wouldn't think of it as -- as Chris outlined, we got some tough comps in the first quarter, the first half, got inflation rolling over. We have price rolling over, but we also have some tough compares against price. But we will have a choppy supply chain at least through the first half of the year. We see some light at the -- through the clouds there as we head into the second half of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. And so that supply chain impacts resi and commercial and transport kind of equally is what you're kind of saying? Dave Regnery : I think it unfortunately affects most industrial companies. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Make sense. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Dave Regnery : Sure. No problem, Pat. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Pat. Operator : The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Emily Xu : Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Emily Xu on for Andrew Obin. Dave Regnery : Hi, Emily. How are you? Chris Kuehn : Hey. Good morning. Emily Xu : Hey. I\u2019m good. So I had a question on IAQ. You had previously guided to IAQ being 1% to 2% points of additional revenue growth tailwind per year. Does that still stick and where do you expect that to end in 2022? And have you seen any momentum in demand for IAQ products, given the Omicron surge? Thanks. Dave Regnery : Yes, Emily. We said early last year that we thought revenue would be in the 1 to 2 tailwind from IAQ. It's actually -- it will be a little bit north of 2 actually. So the year ended up very well for our indoor air quality solutions. And remember, indoor air quality is not new to Trane Technologies. We've been in it for quite some time. But we have launched several new initiatives there, especially on the audit side and what we call day-one, day-two. We're going to continue to see tailwinds from indoor air quality. I wouldn't expect 2% to compound every year. But we do expect to see nice tailwinds for indoor air quality and we're seeing our backlog continues to grow. I would tell you that it's probably harder to count, because these indoor air quality solutions are becoming embedded into our equipment. So, think of it as like a unit controller in a unitary piece of equipment, right? Indoor air quality is just becoming part of the systems. But with that said, we continue to push the envelope there. We've got some great innovation in the pipeline. Really cool things we're doing with our transit bus business in Thermo King. And we're still making a lot of traction with dry hydrogen peroxide as well as some of our photocatalytic solutions. Emily Xu : Awesome. And then, what kind of visibility do you have on the already passed federal stimulus for K-12 education? For example, are there any projects you can sort of trace back to stimulus funding? Or do you have a sense of the scope of how much stimulus has been spent on HVAC since the bill was passed? Thanks. Dave Regnery : Yes. I don't know if I can get that specific, but I would tell you that we have a dedicated tiger team that works on this, so we know where -- how the funding is flowing. And there's a lot of restrictions as you dig into the detail and you may know this, you may not, but some of the stimulus funds have to be going to the education side versus the infrastructure side. But we're working with our customers. We're helping them navigate that -- those dynamics that exist there. And absolutely, we are seeing the funding going all the way through to the local school districts and -- we're there with our customers on day one, helping them on what they could do, day two, actually helping them deploy capital on what they should be doing over the long term. Emily Xu : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi, good morning everyone. Dave Regnery : Hey John, how are you. Chris Kuehn : Good morning. John Walsh : Thank you. Hey, maybe just the first one is a clarification. When you were talking about the tough order comps, obviously they\u2019re across the board, but you did highlight that some of those product lines might see declines, I think. Just wanted to understand, if that was an enterprise comment or specific to those particular product lines you called out? Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, it's certainly going to be the case within our Thermo King business, okay? If you think about it, I mean, our bookings rate last year was twice our order rate, right? So bookings up over 70%, that's not going to continue. And that will -- we have a very strong backlog there, John, so that will burn during the year. So don't be surprised, if you see a quarter or two of negative bookings within Thermo King. But you really need to combine incoming order rates with backlog and really be looking out what the output is to revenue. Chris Kuehn : Yes. Our view now, John, as we kind of look through the year is ending 2022 and starting 2023 with a very strong backlog, well above what our historical level will be. So to Dave's point, one or two quarters of some comping against some very strong order growth. But we see by the end of the year that still being a very healthy backlog going into '23. Dave Regnery : And we'll have tough comps in resi too, okay, just so you're aware. Just on the backlog, I just want to make sure, everyone is clear. Our backlog will be $5.4 billion it was at the end of the year. If you look at that as a percentage of our midpoint revenue guide, it's like 35%. And in a normal year, your backlog would be like 20%. So I mean, we have a very, very, very strong backlog for the year. John Walsh : Great. No, I appreciate that. And maybe just a quick one on uses of cash. Obviously, you called out elevated spend for repo in January. How does the deal pipeline look as you're thinking about the balance of the year and toggling between share repo and M&A? Thank you. Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, our M&A pipeline is robust and we look at a lot of opportunities, as you would imagine, being a major HVAC player in the industry. So we always have a full pipeline that we evaluate. Chris Kuehn : Hi, John, I would add, on the $1.9 billion to M&A and share repurchase, we did repurchase $350 million here in January. So let's say, approximately $1.5 billion left to deploy in the year. And from a modeling perspective, just given we can't identify yet how much is to be spent on M&A versus share repurchase, for our guidance, we just assumed the whole $1.5 billion remaining would be the share repurchase kind of ratably over the remaining quarters of the year. So we'll update everyone as we go quarter-to-quarter. But certainly, a preference would be to spend some value of that $1.5 billion on M&A. John Walsh : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Dave Regnery : No, Problem. Thanks, John Operator : The next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna :  Hi. Good morning, guys. Dave Regnery : Hi, Gautam. How are you? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Gautam Khanna : Doing well, Doing well. I just wanted to follow up. I think it may have been Josh who asked the earlier question on this, but can you talk a little bit about how in the commercial space, if at all, if the business model is evolving? So customers concerned about ESG targets of their own, presumably utilizing HVAC as a tool to hit those targets, as opposed to just pay back on energy savings or whatever as a stimulant to demand. Are you seeing like performance contracts where if you can guarantee certain greenhouse reductions, you get paid for it? It's just sort of the terms of sort of the contract, are they changing in any meaningful way? And does that maybe allow for some pricing power in commercial that didn't exist before? Dave Regnery : That's a great question. I would tell you that, that's a great question, and I would tell you that it's very, very early innings there. But obviously, there's a lot of questions. We're getting calls from customers and asking how we could help them decarbonize their built environment. And one of the things we did, Gautam, that was maybe a little bit different than some is, we actually went out and practiced on ourselves first. So part of our commitments is to reduce our own greenhouse gas. So we're implementing best practices in many of our facilities as well so that we could take customers there and show them what we've done. But you're certainly on to the decarbonization-as-a-service type environment that is getting some traction. I would tell you its very early innings but it's getting traction. Gautam Khanna : And just as a follow-up, do you think it actually confers kind of greater pricing power in the commercial market, I mean, over time than has been the case historically where we think of it being more competitive than in resi, for example? concentration of the customers. Dave Regnery : Yes. It's a fair question. I think we'll be able to write that chapter probably in the coming years here. But I would tell you that whenever we've had products and services that have high efficiency, the complex problems to solve for our customers, we tend to do very well. Gautam Khanna : Appreciate the color. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Okay. Thanks. Operator : The next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Dave Regnery : Hi, How are you? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Deane Dray : Doing well. Thanks. I might have missed this, but did you size any revenue push-out from 4Q into the first quarter that would be comparable to the $130 million that got pushed out from 3Q? Chris Kuehn : Yeah. I mean, we did not, okay, so you didn't miss anything. But obviously, we did have \u2013 we did have some revenue that pushed out from Q4 into future periods. It's probably in the same realm that we saw going from Q3 to Q4 in that $150 million range. One thing that's different there, in the fourth quarter, we had visibility working with our suppliers that we would recoup about half of that in the fourth \u2013 in the quarter, it will be in the fourth quarter, which we did. We do not have that same visibility as we enter Q1. So obviously, we're not including that in our guide. Deane Dray : Not including the guide for the first quarter, is that it? Dave Regnery : That's correct. That's correct. Deane Dray : Got it. Dave Regnery : Obviously, the backlog will churn and it will be within the year, for sure, but not in the first quarter. Deane Dray : Is that mostly electronic components still? Dave Regnery : Yeah, yeah. Electronic components is still the biggest concern we have. There have been some areas of supply chain that have improved, as I said earlier, but electronic components has got still -- we still have some significant choppiness there. Deane Dray : Great. Just last question for me. On the increase in CapEx for the year, you referenced some higher returns. Can you size for us what kind of returns you're getting on these projects? And maybe an example of your own de-carbonization investment you're doing? Chris Kuehn : Yeah, Deane, I think we see multiple categories kind of driving a little bit higher CapEx, again still within our range of 1% to 2%, but right now expecting it to be closer to 2% in 2022. The categories would be around capacity expansion, driving further automation in the plants, supply chain resiliency projects here as we kind of manage through this transitionary year in 2022, improving front-end systems. Maybe one thing to highlight on the sustainability side. As we take older pieces of machinery off-line there's examples where you've got three pieces of machinery in a factory that you're able to deploy one piece of machinery today, just given improvements to technology and efficiency. And for us, that we should have a lower impact on the environment, a lower impact on energy usage. So those are the types of things we begin to lean in. Dave Regnery : This is Dave. I was out at one of our factories in the Midwest, and they were showing me examples where they literally had four old pieces of equipment and they took them out of service. These were old pieces of equipment that the old \u2013 our prior mindset would have been the asset's fully depreciated. I only run it 40% of the time. I don't need the space. We take those out, we put in a new piece of equipment dramatically reduce the energy load in the facility. In many cases, you're able to increase throughput with the newer machine with newer technology. And it's just a great program that they're working through as are many of our factories around the world. So it's sort of what we're talking about all the time is don't wait for new \u2013 you don't need to wait for new technology. Deploy what's available today and you're going to get significant benefit. And it's the same \u2013 what we say is what we do. Deane Dray : Well, sounds good. Thank you. Dave Regnery : All right. Thank you. Chris Kuehn : Thanks. Operator : That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call over to Zac Nagle for any closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Great. Thanks, Chris. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. As always, we'll be around for any questions that you may have in the coming days and weeks. And we look forward to hopefully seeing many of you on the road in 2022. Thank you. And have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. To allow time for everyone to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. I will now turn the call over to Zach Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zach Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Zach and everyone, for joining us on today's call. Let's turn to slide number 3. I'd like to open with a few comments on our purpose-driven strategy, the engine that enables us to deliver differentiated shareholder returns over time. Our strategy is firmly rooted in our purpose to challenge what's possible for a sustainable world and aligned to the mega trends that are only getting stronger. We are seeing the impact of climate change on the world every day, including more extreme weather events and far-reaching effects on air quality, water quality, food production and human health. The science is clear. There is no time to wait. The world must take action now to limit global warming and mitigate the effects of climate change. That's where our purpose meets our strategy. Trane Technologies is already taking action to dramatically reduce emissions through innovative solutions that drive electrification, energy efficiency and emissions reductions for commercial buildings, homes and transport. We have set aggressive science based emission reduction targets that continue to push our innovation further and faster. Customers continue to choose us as their partner in achieving their sustainability goals while improving performance and efficiency. Our relentless approach to innovate, strong customer focus and purpose-driven culture enable us to consistently outgrow our end markets. This in turn helps us drive strong margin and powerful free cash flow to deploy through our balanced capital allocation strategy. The end result is strong value creation across the board, for our customers, for our team, for our shareholders and for the planet. Moving to slide number 4. While we'll cover the details of the quarter and our outlook throughout our discussion today, the primary message I'd like investors to take away from today's call is that the company has never been in a stronger position to deliver highly differentiated financial performance and shareholder returns over the long-term. Our end markets are strong. And our innovation leadership is at the apex of powerful secular mega trends of energy efficiency and de-carbonization, which is enabling us to win customers at an unprecedented pace. Our business operating system remains at the core of everything we do and is delivering strong price realization to offset the impact of inflation, which is running at multiples of even the highest historical levels. And our balance sheet, liquidity position and ability to deliver strong free cash flow provides a solid financial foundation. We have exceptional firepower and optionality to not only navigate near-term macro challenges, but to flourish as they abate. Our strong performance in the first quarter is ahead of our initial guidance expectations on both incremental price to offset higher inflation and on volume growth, while it's still early in the year and the macro environments remain very dynamic, our performance in Q1 and serves to increase our confidence that we're on pace to meet or exceed our full year guidance. Our booking levels remain extremely high, reflecting strong share gains in virtually every area of our business, with supply chain challenges impacting throughput in the near term. The absolute booking levels we've delivered over the past year have been extraordinary. There was a tendency to focus on bookings growth trends, but growth trends may be misleading when absolute numbers move step functions higher than any historical reference period. We encourage investors and analysts to consider both absolute bookings and bookings growth to get a fuller picture. Our first quarter provides a prime example. Organic sales were up 12%, while organic bookings were up about half that amount, up 6%. A fairly normal reaction to bookings growth being half the level of revenue growth might be to assume that the book-to-bill ratio would be negative and that backlog would be lower as a result. However, given our tremendous bookings growth in Q1 of 2021 of over 30%, absolute bookings in the first quarter of 2022 were still extremely high at $4.3 billion. Even with strong revenue growth of 12%, absolute revenues in the first quarter of 2022 were $3.4 billion. It maybe counterintuitive, but bookings exceeded revenues by more than $800 million. Our book-to-bill was extremely strong at 129% and our backlog grew more than 50% year-over-year. Backlog also grew $800 million or 15% sequentially from Q4 to Q1. Given extremely high levels of bookings throughout 2021, we believe this is an important area to watch to gauge strength as we move forward. With $16.8 billion in bookings and $14.1 billion in revenues in fiscal 2021, the dynamic I referenced as an example from Q1 will be present throughout the year. As I look at our business, the strong secular trends, our leading innovation, unprecedented customer demand, and record backlogs and the financial health of our company, I'm very bullish about the future. We have all the fundamental ingredients to deliver differentiated financial performance and strong shareholder returns over the long term. Please turn to slide number 5. On Earth Day, we released our 2021 environmental, social and governance report. The report highlights our notable progress towards our science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets, diversity and inclusion commitments and other sustainability goals. I am proud of the progress we made last year. We exceeded or met nearly all of our annual targets on our glide path towards our 2030 sustainability commitments. We reduced carbon emissions, energy use, waste and water. In addition, we increased the representation of women in leadership and workforce diversity reflective of our communities. I encourage you to read the full report. It's available on our website. Building on the momentum captured in our 2021 report, I'm happy to announce that we recently learned that our 2050 net zero targets were validated by the science-based target initiative. At this time, we are the first company in our industry and one of only 11 companies globally to have 2050 net zero targets validated. This is another example of how we are leading and challenging what is possible for a sustainable world, and we encourage like-minded companies to join us. Looking forward, I am confident we will continue to innovate, take bold actions and transform the world for a better tomorrow today. Please turn to Slide number 6. Customer demand for our climate-focused innovation continues to grow. We delivered another quarter of robust organic bookings, up 6% in the first quarter. Organic revenues were also strong, up 12%. Supply constraints are impacting each of our segments, with particular tight supply as we move up the food chain on product complexity. Generally speaking, the more intelligent and complex the product, the more chipsets they require and the more constrained the supply in the near term. Given extremely high levels of demand and backlog more than double historical norms, unconstrained revenues would be significantly higher in every segment. As mentioned previously, our bookings in the quarter totaled $4.3 billion, far exceeding our revenue of $3.4 billion, which were in part constrained by global supply chain and other macro challenges. With these robust bookings, our backlog grew to a record $6.2 billion. Our Americas Commercial HVAC business continues to deliver extremely strong bookings. Over the past four quarters, bookings growth has averaged nearly 30%, and Q1 bookings were up approximately 35%. Strength was broad-based, with applied and unitary each up more than 50%. Service bookings were also strong, up mid-teens. Demand for our comprehensive solutions remained strong and contributed to our low-teens organic revenue growth in commercial HVAC Americas. The residential HVAC markets also remained strong. Our residential HVAC team delivered mid single-digit bookings growth and low-teens revenue growth in the quarter. As expected, Transport Americas bookings were down in the quarter on tough prior year compare and because we intentionally constrained demand in order to manage inflationary risks. Unconstrained demand would be much stronger, but customers understand the dynamics and are working closely with us on slots. Bookings remained at healthy levels, with bookings in excess of revenues in the quarter and adding to backlog sequentially from Q4. Revenues were strong, up mid-teens. Turning to EMEA. We continue to see strong demand for our innovative products and services that help reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for our customers. EMEA commercial HVAC bookings were up low teens and revenues were up low single-digits. As expected, transport bookings were down on tough prior year compares. Similar to our America Transport business, we are intentionally constraining demand in order to manage inflationary risks. Absolute bookings remained at healthy levels, with bookings in excess of revenues and backlog up sequentially from Q4. Revenues were strong, up high single-digits. Our Asia Pacific team delivered strong bookings and revenue growth of 14%, supported by broad-based growth in China and across the region. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number 7. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was driven by both strong volume growth and continued strong price execution. Turning to margins. We drove strong core incremental margins of approximately 30%, on solid volume growth of 5%. Volume growth was stronger than expected due to our outstanding performance by our teams and partnership with our suppliers in what remains a choppy supply chain environment. Strong price execution through our business operating system also enabled us to neutralize the impact of higher inflation on a dollar basis, but it was about a 100 basis point headwind to margins in the quarter. Productivity was significantly impacted by continued supply chain challenges, including choosing to incur expedited freight costs and spot buys, consistent with our customer-focused business model. In addition, we continue to make strong incremental business reinvestments, supporting our sustainability focused strategy. All in, adjusted EBITDA and operating margins declined 70 basis points. Adjusted EPS grew 11%, driven primarily from higher adjusted operating income. Please turn to Slide number 8. We discussed the key revenue and margin dynamics for the enterprise on the prior page. The dynamics impacting revenue and margins were similar across each of our business segments, with volume growth, strong price realization, incremental business reinvestments, and innovation and macro challenges impacting productivity and cost inflation as consistent drivers. Our Americas segment delivered strong price execution, slightly ahead of material inflation and offsetting expected negative impacts from negative price/cost in both our EMEA and Asia Pacific segments. Consistent with our prior guide, we expect price/cost to improve throughout 2022 in each region. And we expect to be price/cost positive on a dollar basis for the full year for the total company. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number 9. As we've discussed throughout the call, underlying demand for our innovative products and services have never been higher, with unprecedented levels of bookings and backlog across our businesses. Commercial HVAC Americas has significantly outperformed the broader markets over a number of years through relentless innovation for our customers. We're driving unprecedented demand, with orders up nearly 30% over the past four consecutive quarters, which is indicative of our clear market leadership. And we're exiting the first quarter with another quarter of record backlog, up more than 70% year-over-year and more than double historical norms. End markets remain strong, with a variety of economic indicators pointing to growth in 2022. Unemployment is low. And indicators like the Architectural Billing Index, which has been over 50 since February of 2021, remain favorable. Demand remains strong in data center, warehouse, education and health care. Everyday we see customers establishing their own sustainability targets, creating decarbonization road maps and helping them to achieve their targets with our customized system-based approach. We're helping our K-12 customers deploy federal stimulus funds to improve the indoor air quality of schools. We see both decarbonization and indoor air quality as multiyear tailwind for our business, given our deep customer relationships and expertise. Demand for our residential products remains strong. We entered the second quarter with tailwinds from record backlog and expected strong price realization. We see headwinds from lapping tough growth compares from 2021. Turning to Americas Transport. AC projects continued market growth through their forecast horizon of 2023. I'll talk more about transport outlook in our topics of interest section. Turning to EMEA. While we have muted expectations for market growth, with a volatile geopolitical backdrop continuing, demand for our sustainability-focused systems and services remain strong, and we continue to see good opportunities for market outgrowth. Turning to Asia. We are monitoring the COVID lockdowns in China and their broader impact on the region. Outside of Shanghai, we have a plant impacted by the lockdowns that provide equipment or components to support our customers in China and the rest of Asia. Our guidance assumes China reopens mid-May. And any revenue impact due to the China lockdowns during Q2 will be recouped in the second half of the year. For the year, we continue to see underlying strength in China's data center, electronics, pharmaceutical and health care markets. Outside of China, the picture is mixed, with COVID-related lockdown still impacting market expansion in some countries. Our direct sales model is differentiated in the region and provides good opportunities for market outgrowth in both equipment and services. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris to outline our guidance for Q2 and full year 2022. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number 10. Based on the market outlook Dave just outlined and our strong bookings and backlog, we are on track to deliver strong financial performance in 2022. We are updating our full year organic revenue growth guidance to approximately 10%, primarily to reflect additional strong price realization to offset persistent material inflation. Our adjusted EPS outlook remains unchanged, between $6.95 and $7.15. We continue to expect a stronger second half, with an improving supply chain and product redesigns coming online that will help us serve our customers better and provide added resiliency to our supply chain. Our updated operating leverage outlook of approximately mid-teens contemplates both additional price realization and additional material inflation. We continue to expect price cost to be slightly positive for the year on a dollar basis. We expect free cash flow to remain strong and equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net income. Our outlook includes capital expenditures of approximately 2% of revenues and high ROI projects in support of our profitable growth objectives and our sustainability commitment. These high ROI projects include manufacturing automation, supply chain resiliency as well as investments to further decarbonize our operation.  Our free cash flow outlook also includes modest investment in working capital, with a particular focus on strategic inventory to support continued growth. Please turn to Slide number 11. While we traditionally provide annual guidance, given the dynamic macroeconomic environment, we believe it may be constructive to provide an outlook for the second quarter based on what we see today. For the second quarter, we expect core organic revenue growth of approximately 10% to 12%. As mentioned previously, our second quarter Asia Pacific revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by the lockdowns in China by approximately $80 million to $100 million, a headwind of approximately 2% to 3% for the total company. Our guidance assumes China reopens mid-May. And any revenue headwinds due to the China lockdowns during Q2 will be recouped in the second half. Net, we expect our organic second quarter revenues to be up high single-digits and expect continued strong price realization. At this stage, we expect to offset inflation with price on a dollar basis, which carries a heavy margin headwind for the quarter. We see macro supply chain challenges continuing to hamper productivity. We also expect continued expedited freight costs and spot buys as we focus on meeting our customers' needs for sustainable solutions. As we discussed on the prior slide, our full year outlook contemplates a stronger second half, with an improving macro environment. We'll continue to update our full year outlook as the year goes along. Please go to Slide number 12. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023. Importantly, we continue to invest in these cost savings and high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio. We've highlighted some of our innovation for decarbonization on Slide 21 of this presentation for your reference. Please go to Slide number 13. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide number 14, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment in 2022. In the first quarter, we deployed $506 million in cash, with $350 million of share repurchases and $156 million to dividends. Our Board also authorized an additional $3 billion for share repurchases, bringing our total remaining share repurchase authorization to $4 billion as of the end of the first quarter. Turning to M&A. We completed a small channel acquisition in April, and our M&A pipeline remains active. All in, we're on track to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash in 2022, inclusive of $1.9 billion between M&A and share repurchases. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality and dry powder moving forward. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please go to Slide number 16. Global transport markets are expected to remain healthy through 2023. ACT has recently moderated their expectations for transport growth in North America for 2022, largely driven by expected OEM trailer supply chain constraints. European forecasts have moderated somewhat also, reflecting current OEM supply constraints and uncertainty related to the conflict in the Ukraine. Weighted average transport market growth in America is 8%, down about four points. EMEA market transport growth is forecasted to be flat, down about three points from our previous outlook. After clear share gains in truck, trailer and APU globally in 2021, we're expecting global outgrowth in 2022 as well. Please go to, slide number17. We've updated the transport growth outlook slide for North America in the slide deck for reference and additional transparency. ACT continues to call for a nine-year average for North America trailers, in the mid-40,000 unit range through 2023, with the pandemic in 2020 being the only significant outlier. Please go to, slide number 18. Energy efficiency, decarbonization and sustainability megatrends are only growing stronger. We are uniquely positioned to deliver leading innovation that addresses these trends, and accelerates the world's progress, supported by our business transformation and our engaging uplifting culture. Despite a number of persistent macro challenges, Q1 was a record quarter for us, which provides a solid foundation as we move into the rest of the year. While it's still early in the year, our first quarter performance and our outlook for the second quarter have us well positioned to meet or exceed our full year guidance. We're seeing unprecedented levels of demand for our innovative products and services. And our backlog has never been stronger. We're executing our business operating system well. And expect to continue to successfully navigate macro challenges with a customer-first mindset. We believe we have the fundamental ingredients, to deliver strong performance across the board in 2022 and beyond, and to continue to drive differentiated shareholder returns over the long-term. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions, Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey good morning everybody. Dave Regnery : Hey, Scott. How are you doing? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Scott Davis : Good. Thank you. Kind of a big picture question here I mean, this -- the energy independence theme in Europe is center stage or I think taking -- or getting a lot of attention here. How does that change the HVAC landscape? I mean, are you seeing more incomings related to trying to drive a little bit more energy efficiency there? Is that a real driver yet of demand? Dave Regnery : Absolutely, I mean, we're seeing unprecedented demand right now as you our results in the first quarter. And a lot of it has to do with our new innovations around products that are helping our customers decarbonize, which is just a massive opportunities in the future. Scott Davis : Yeah. I think actually -- I mean, I think what I've kind of meant, Dave, is it incrementally make it -- I mean, demand has been strong in Europe, but is it incrementally increasing just in the last few months since the Ukraine invasion? Dave Regnery : We're still seeing strong growth in Europe. I think you also have some regulation that's starting to come through there where fossil fuels are just not going to be permitted in certain countries. We see that continuing to grow -- I think Germany was the latest country to adopt that type of legislation. So a lot of the products that we have, and I think we're now on our -- I was just over in Europe a couple of weeks ago. And we're on our fifth generation thermal management system, which is really the combination of a boiler and a chiller into a system which allows the customer to accelerate their decarbonization efforts by eliminating fossil fuel. So we're excited about the opportunity. It keeps growing. We keep innovating for it. And I would tell you, it's not just unique to Europe. We're seeing it really on a global basis. Scott Davis : Okay. And given your stock price and just market dynamics overall, would -- should we expect a big tick up in buybacks in 2Q? Chris Kuehn : Scott, this is Chris. What I would say is, we see a lot of value in our shares today. And frankly, we saw a lot of value in our shares three months ago. We take a long-term view in terms of stock valuation and looking at our intrinsic value. As we noted on the prepared remarks, we have a lot of firepower with respect to repurchases, $3 billion new authorization provided by our Board here in the first quarter puts total capacity around $4 billion here at the end of the first quarter. So we really like the position we're in. The balance sheet has got a lot of capacity to do both M&A and repurchases. So we're not limited. The guide on the year is $2.5 billion roughly of deployment, with about $1.9 billion of share repurchase and M&A. And we'll continue to execute that quarter-by-quarter as we go through the year. But our priorities remain consistent in how we allocate our funds and our cash. We see a lot of value in the shares. We have a lot of firepower. And look, I think we're really on track for the full year here to deploy that cash. Scott Davis : Sounds good. Thank you. Good luck guys. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Scott. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Thank you. Good morning guys. Dave Regnery : Hey Joe, how are you? Chris Kuehn : Good morning, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Doing well guys. Thanks for the question. Just the first one, I've been asking this to basically every company. But the China lockdown exposure, the $80 million to $100 million, just how has that progressed in 2Q? And clearly, like you're assuming the reopening in mid-May. That's not too far away. Just give us kind of like your confidence that you feel like that's pretty well ring-fenced at this point. Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, let me just take a higher level first. I mean, we've had a manufacturing strategy for years of -- in region, for region. So the factor that we're -- is in lockdown is in the Shanghai region. But understand that about 90% of our supply chain tends to follow our manufacturing strategy. So think of it as a manufacturing plant, you have about 90% of that located in that same region. We anticipate the factory will be back online in the quarter. The pause, as we said earlier, will result in approximately $80 million to $100 million in revenue moving out of the quarter. We plan on making it up in the back half of the year. We're starting to see some positive signs where we see some movement happening in the area again. So we'll stay tuned. But right now, our guide has us reopening in the second half of the month that we're in. Joe Ritchie : Okay. That's helpful, Dave. And I guess maybe my follow-on there is, just the recoup of the backlog in the back half of the year and then also the pricing that is in your backlog today that you're building. How do you get comfort that, number one, you will be able to recoup and there isn\u2019t potential lost revenues, there are loss backlog there? And then secondly, on the pricing dynamics, just given the inflationary backdrop that we're in right now, that you guys are pricing accordingly and the margins will come through accordingly? Dave Regnery : Yes. I'll start with being able to recoup. We have a lot of capacity in our facilities there. So, we're pretty confident we'll be able that once we get turned back on, we'll be able to turn back on. We also have a smaller workforce in our facility today with obviously a proper permission for them to be there to making sure that all of our equipment is in fact, being run. Some of these precision machines, you need to make sure they stay fine-tuned. So, we're proactively doing that. So, when the word is go, we're ready to go. So, we'll be able to -- we're pretty confident we can recoup this in the back half of the year. Chris, do you want to talk about pricing? Chris Kuehn : Yes. Sure. And I'll talk about the firmness of the backlog too. Joe, we don't see any risk right now on the backlog, everything appears to be firm. From a pricing perspective, we're on our second round of price increases here in 2022. We wound up at three rounds roughly of price increases in 2021. Certainly, from say 90 days ago, material inflation in the quarter in Q1 and certainly on a full year basis is going to be higher than what we thought 90 days ago. But we're seeing stronger price realization. The second round of price increases is giving us confidence that we've got the opportunity to be flattish in the second quarter and be price/cost positive on the full year. On the backlog in terms of pricing, as we think about our longer live, let's say, applied systems orders, those orders, given that they're 6, 9, 12 months out, will generally have a price escalation clause inserted in there. So there's some protection in that regard. In our residential business, not only through price increases we've done, same on the commercial side. But the price increases we've done, we've also repriced the backlog. So it's given us an opportunity to reset that pricing when we see a material change in inflation.  And then last, but not least, on the transport portfolio, we've had price increases as well there. But we're also really intentionally managing the demand and the bookings, making sure we're only opening up the bookings for a quarter when we've got good line of sight to what the cost is going to be in that quarter.  So, we're intentionally kind of limiting demand at this point. And I would say, for example, we don't have order books mostly open in the fourth quarter this year, would be an area where we're kind of pausing until we get closer to understand the cost environment.  But we're not seeing demand destruction at this point at all with the price increases we've had to put in place. In fact, we really look at them as inflation-based price increases. We're really not out here to price guess, we're just trying to offset the inflation that we've got. Hopefully, that helps. Joe Ritchie : Yeah, very helpful. Thanks guys. Chris Kuehn : Thanks Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. John Walsh : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions here. Chris Kuehn : Good morning, John. John Walsh : Yes. Thank you. So, I guess if we could focus on the strength in the Americas. One of your competitors had some issues around light commercial and other ones seemed like they had some supply chain issues with controls. I guess can you kind of talk about if you're seeing any market share shifts or maybe what you think you outgrew the market or what the market did, blended for the Americas? Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, I'd tell you, if you think about the Americas, our commercial HVAC business continues to see very healthy end markets. Very low unemployment. Positive Architectural Billing Index for 14 months in a row now, which is just a great indicator for six to nine months. Applied and unitary bookings were both up over 50% in the quarter, 50%. So we're seeing tremendous demand right now. And we believe that that's going to continue. We're seeing broad-based growth, too. So electronics, data centers, education, health care, office. I mean, as I looked across the verticals last week, I was -- I couldn't find a vertical that was down. So we're continuing to see very strong demand there, Decarbonization of the built environment continues to be a tailwind for us. Indoor air quality continues to be a tailwind. So a lot of strength in the commercial HVAC business in the America. If you go over to res, it's only about 20% of our business, but we saw a strong quarter. The team did well there. 6% order growth, and that comes against a very tough compare, where last year, we were up -- the exact number was north of 40%. So very strong growth there. And as far as share goes, it's hard for me to say in a constrained environment. You could look at order share and shipping share and get two totally different answers. Our product is obviously -- and our backlog is more weighted towards our applied complex products. And as we said in our opening remarks, think about that as where the constraint tends to be more. The more intelligent your product is, the more chipsets that are required, the more constrained in the short term. But long term, we're very, very bullish about our market share gains. And we're very bullish, too, about what we're seeing in the market and hitting the spots with our innovations. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe if we think about the guidance construct. I think a couple of times you said meet or exceed. Obviously, still a lot of year left. You put the FX headwind now in the numbers. So what's kind of maybe coming in a little bit better to offset that as you think about the portfolio? Thank you. Chris Kuehn : Yes. Thanks, John. You're right. For the full year adjusted EPS, we held at $6.95 to $7.15. We did incorporate about $0.05 of headwind from FX in that guide as well. So we're feeling confident we can offset that. Look, we're in the first quarter of the year. It's traditionally the lightest quarter of the year when we think about HVAC companies. So we're happy with the results where we are in the first quarter. It turned out stronger than we thought when we guided 90 days ago or so. So it's giving us increased confidence on the full year basis. We took the full year revenue up to 10% or approximately 10%, given what we're seeing an increased price realization. So right where we sit, we were in the first quarter. We've got three more to go. And we're certainly going to update you and the group when we get to the Q2 earnings release, because we'll be halfway through the year at that point. We'll have a much better sense on where things are shaking out on a full year basis. With the performance in the first quarter and the guide in Q2, we've really derisked a bit of the back half of the year. We got out ahead of price here in the first quarter. That's a good sign. We thought we'd be okay there, but a little bit stronger than where -- we landed a little bit stronger than where we thought. So it's just giving us more confidence also on the full year basis that we should be price/cost positive on a dollar basis. John Walsh : Great. Thank you and good quarter. I\u2019ll pass it along. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, John. Appreciate that. John Walsh : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hi. Good morning, guys. Dave Regnery : Hey, Andy. How are you? Chris Kuehn : Hey, Andy. Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Good. How are you? So maybe you could just give us a little more color into how you're looking at resi HVAC in 2022? You said strong quarter. You said in the past, resi construction would be up low single-digits. And I think, using your words, Dave, you said replacement won't fall off a cliff. But books were up mid single-digits and revenue at start of the year up low-teens, as you said. So can you give us a little more color on your outlook now and how you're thinking about inventories in the channel? Dave Regnery : Yes. It's a good question. Not 300, but order rates remained strong in the first quarter, up 6%. And that was a bit of a surprise to us considering we were up 40% the prior year. So the demand continues to be strong. Our independent sell-through was strong. The inventory in the channel is about where we expect it to be. In the first quarter, we had growth in the new construction channel, although it's a smaller portion of our business. We'll watch interest rates there and see what happens. But to use your words, we don't see it falling off a cliff, the replacement cycle. Again, resi is about 20% of our business. So even if the replacement cycle did drop 10%, which we don't see it happening, it would be about a 2% drop for the enterprise. And the amount of opportunities that we are seeing in the decarbonization opportunities in both our commercial HVAC business and our Thermo King business on a global basis will far exceed that. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that Dave. And then, I think, you said last quarter that you would be upside down on price versus cost by $30 million to $40 million in Q1. But it turns out you were relatively flattish. I think you mentioned the accelerated price realization. Was this really just going in and repricing your backlog? Wasn't the mix help you at all? And then does it really give you more confidence in sort of staying ahead in terms of that sort of modest green for the year in price versus cost? Chris Kuehn : Yes, Andy. It does give us confidence on the full year basis. You're right. We guided negative price cost in the first quarter, and we wound up realizing flattish. Certainly, some additional volume coming through allows for maybe a little bit more price to come through. But I would tell you that the price execution by our teams has been very strong. I know these are not easy conversations to have with customers. We hear that all the time from our businesses and our leaders. The fact is though we're trying to just offset this persistent inflation. So in the quarter, it was a little bit more inflation, a little bit more price. We got it to flattish. And given our comp on the first half of the year, very strong price a year ago with moderate inflation is where our thoughts were. We could have some headwinds in the first half of the year, giving us confidence we're going to be flattish in the first half of the year on a dollar basis for price cost. Dave Regnery : Yes. Really, our business operating system is really being leveraged across the enterprise right now. We see what's coming around the corner, and the teams are being very proactive. Andy, you also asked a question about mix. Yes, mix helped us a bit in the quarter. We are seeing mix up. And that really -- that's a good news story because that's where a lot of our innovation is. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it guys. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Andy. Have a good day. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Dave Regnery : Hi, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Maybe just wanted to start off perhaps with the volume outlook, I think you talked initially a few months ago about volumes being kind of flattish in the first quarter or even down. And you ended up, I think, plus 5% or so. And so, I just wanted to understand kind of what drove that volume upside? And then as you look at the balance of the year, what are we expecting in terms of kind of volume versus price? Do you see that 5% of volume slowing down, for example, because of resi HVAC or things like transport with the ACT adjustment? Dave Regnery : Yeah. Let me start, and then I'll ask Chris to comment a little bit on the pricing side. As far as the volume is concerned, what we saw in the first quarter, it's not -- it's a demand -- our demand is constrained by supply. Okay? So with our backlog, if we had unconstrained supply right now, we'd be shipping much more and we'd be invoicing much more. So in the first quarter, we opportunistically bought some for lack of better explanation, chipsets on the open market and spot buys, which we think is a good investment for retaining our customers. So, we wanted to take care and we saw an opportunity, and we executed on it. And we saw more volume come through in the first quarter as a result of that. Now can that continue through the rest of the year? Supply chain, as we said in the fourth quarter, is going to be choppy through the first half of the year. We have more confidence in the back half of the year. Working with our suppliers closely, understanding their constraints, understanding their commitments to us. Also, some help -- self-help redesigns that we have coming online in the third quarter. So that gives us confidence in the back half of the year. I don't know if you want to talk a little bit about pricing? Chris Kuehn : Yeah. I would add, Julian, to Dave's point on being aggressive and opportunistic, that will probably continue here into the second quarter. We'll see what's available and see if we can do better there. On pricing, look, the realization came in stronger on the first quarter. We've got a second round of price increases that we've already announced for this year. And we're remaining nimble depending on what happens with material inflation and freight inflation for the year to correspond appropriately. I think on the -- as Dave mentioned, in the second half, with the self-help initiatives, the redesigns that we have, that gives us confidence the second half is going to have stronger volume growth. And with that, comes stronger incrementals, and ultimately, hopefully with some less inefficiencies in the plants and otherwise that have really been pervasive for us in the second half of last year and really so far this year. Julian Mitchell : Thanks a lot. And just on that second point, yes, just looking at kind of what's implied for the back half. As you said, it looks like you're looking at sort of maybe 40%-plus kind of half-on-half operating leverage, year-on-year, something like in the 30s for the back half on leverage. Just wanted to check those numbers were roughly okay. And then to your book, Chris, that's a mix of what price cost, is the assumption that the margin headwind on price cost by Q4 is about zero? So that's part of it. And then you also have some of those volume inefficiencies cleaning up. Chris Kuehn : Yes. I'd say on the second half, certainly, we expect incrementals to be stronger than the first half. We'll see where it kind of plays out on the second half of the year, Julian. But given the volume coming through, let's say, 30% plus incrementals, we'll see where productivity , other inflation falls out. I do think, on a full year basis, we're going to see the price/cost equation, even if we're positive on a dollar basis, that can -- it's still going to present some challenges on the margin in terms of being able to get that positive. I just think that math may be challenging throughout the year. But we do expect leverage to be stronger in the second half. We see on a full year basis that organic leverage being around the mid-teens range based on what we see today. And then we'll update you and the team here in the next quarter earnings release based on another quarter of performance. And we'll see where that kind of falls out for the year. But again, in the first quarter, we've been really pleased with what our teams have been able to do around procurement and engineering to find solutions. And I know that they're still trying to do that today. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. Dave Regnery : Thanks Julian. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Dave Regnery : Hey Josh. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hey good morning guys. Dave Regnery : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Just kind of continuation of Julian's question there on what sort of the margin kind of cadence maybe is from here. I know you guys have talked about kind of longer-term 25% incrementals. But as we kind of work through maybe the worst of this kind of inflation wave where pricing costs are both high and drive down margins and some of the supply chain interruption, do we get to have this period of kind of above-trend incrementals for a while, or are you still kind of sticking with 25% as the longer term number? Chris Kuehn : Well, we like 25% as a long-term number. Last year, we were able to drive 30% incrementals. And part of that was getting out in front of price earlier. We had good volume last year. So, those really contributed to above the long-term target. This year, it really is a price/cost dynamic that's -- just having that headwind on the margins on the first quarter and likely in the full year. I do think, depending on where direct material inflation falls out, Josh, this is an industry that typically holds on to price fairly well. If we start to see deflation, which we don't see right now on the full year basis in 2022, but if you do see deflation, supply chains continue to recover and we get our strong incrementals on volume, we can offset price/cost. We'll see where that plays out. That may be a good formula for us. But long-term, we like the 25%. One thing I would add, in the quarter and also for Q2 in the guide, we continue to invest incremental investments into our innovation and new product development. That's not something we're all relenting on. And again, we'd like to save five points of incrementals. Let's say, let's take five points of that incremental, let's invest it back in the business to get us to that 25% long-term target. Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it, that's helpful. And then on the applied orders, Dave, I think you mentioned that those were up more than 50%. Any way to sort of break down that on the replacement side? I would imagine that's even stronger still. And how much of that is sort of higher bill of material or kind of scope versus higher volume? Dave Regnery : Yes, I don't have the direct split yet on the repair -- retrofit versus new. But I would tell you that, it was strong across all verticals. Okay? Data centers, electronics. And it really just speaks volumes to the innovations that we've been able to put into the market. And we have customers that were winning today, because of the solutions that we're able to provide. And it's not just about the chiller. It's about the control system that goes with it. It's about the building controls. It's about being connected to the product. It's about being able to run AI algorithms against data that's in a data warehouse to improve the efficiency of buildings and data centers and hospitals. And it's all of that system of things that's just really -- we're in high gear here, and you could see it by the order rates that we're taking in. So we're -- the team is really excited. I've never -- I was out in one of our sales offices a couple of weeks ago, and I would tell you that, the teams there have never been more pumped up about, number one, the innovation that we're providing them to go to talk to customers about and to win customers, but just the whole -- the strength that they're seeing within the marketplace. So it's an exciting time right now. We're hopeful that the -- and we believe it will. The back half of the year from a supply constraint will get better. And we'll take some of this massive backlog that we have right now, $6.2 billion of backlog. I never thought I would say that. $6.2 billion of backlog, which 90% of it is on our commercial HVAC business. We'll start shipping it, and we'll start taking care of customers. Josh Pokrzywinski : Great. Thanks, guys. Best of luck. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Josh.. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey, guys. Good morning. Dave Regnery : Hey, Steve. Good morning. Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Steve Tusa : First of all, thank you so much for the -- opening the books a bit and with the more precision on the price/cost impact. That's super helpful for the models, for sure. So that precision is much appreciated. Dave Regnery : No problem. Chris Kuehn : Yes, no problem. Steve Tusa : Second of all, on the -- Dave Regnery : I thought -- Steve, I thought you were going to thank me for delivering such a strong first quarter. Steve Tusa : Why would I thank you for that? Yes. So on the commercial HVAC orders, I thought you said applied and unitary were both up. Did you say north of 50% or north of 15%? I didn't quite catch that. Chris Kuehn : 50%, 5-0. Steve Tusa : So, then, if they were -- if commercial HVAC orders were up 35%, does that mean that, like, I guess, you're talking about services in there as well, would have been below that? Yes. Dave Regnery : Exactly. So services, think about services as 50-50, right? 50% of our business is services. Our services were up double digits, so low teens. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then what are you guys assuming for orders? How does that order trend, as we move throughout the year? Not necessarily asking for precision. But like does the 6% accelerate? Does it go to flat? Are you expecting any kind of negative order comps here in the next couple of quarters? Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, again, if you -- the comps get tough, right? Remember, last year, our order rates were up over 30%, and virtually almost every quarter. So they get difficult. But I think you could be looking at -- if you look at a global basis, think about commercial HVAC is probably a bit positive, think about Thermo King, again, where there's different dynamics going in, in that space, where we're actually constraining some of the incoming order rates purposely just to manage inflationary risks, that could be down a bit. So flattish, maybe plus or minus 1% or 2% on a global basis. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Yes. Steve Tusa : Okay. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. If you kind of think there's a scenario, if bookings are flattish in 2022 versus, say, 2021, that's the $16.8 billion that Dave referenced before. We've got about 10% revenue growth approximately on a full year basis. Kind of do that math. It would tell you that the backlog should grow by over $1 billion here just by the end of 2022. So we entered 2022 with record backlog. And we thought, well, maybe that could moderate or even come down. I think the way we could see it today is that, that backlog could be even higher by $1 billion or more as we go into 2023. So it's looking like it's should be a very strong year through the balance of this year and then ultimately as we start 2023. Steve Tusa : Great. I won't say thank you, but I will say a good execution, congrats. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Steve. Dave Regnery : All right. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Dave Regnery : Hey, Nigel, how are you? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Nigel Coe : Yeah. Good, thanks. Good, so obviously, you covered a lot of ground. I do want to have a crack at the -- obviously, the extraordinary growth in the commercial HVAC backlog. In times gone by, we've seen some larger multiyear orders coming through. And I'm just wondering if we are seeing some of these mass retrofit large orders coming to the backlog here. Or is this just a broad base of smaller orders? Dave Regnery : Yeah. There's nothing like a big ESCO job that book. So these are -- this is just broad-based growth across many different verticals. And you think about what's happening with decarbonization, think about what's happening in the education vertical, think about what's happening with indoor air quality. In many verticals, it's nice tailwinds. We've been saying that for a while, and you're seeing it in our order books. Nigel Coe : And is the conversion really gated by, obviously, supply chain and capacity, or are customers putting in orders for multiyears here or getting in line longer than they normally would? Dave Regnery : Yeah. Longer than they normally will just because of our extended lead times. But nothing that I would say is extraordinary. It really is a supply constraint. Nigel Coe : Okay. Dave Regnery : If we had unlimited supply, we'd be shipping a lot of product right now. Nigel Coe : And then my follow-on question is really around the supply chain. It seems like you've got a pretty good handle on the chip supply. But I think one thing we've seen is a lot of quarterly volatility. Rockwell yesterday got tripped up, had a good first quarter, not through the second quarter, JCI. As you ramp up into the stronger 2Q and 3Q periods, how much paranoia and visibility do you have on that supply? I'm just wondering, obviously, we're now into April. You've got bigger May. What gives you the confidence that you're going to get tripped up by, I don't know, something happening in the next couple of months? Dave Regnery : Well, I'm not very paranoid as a person, so I won't use that term. But it really has to do with working with our suppliers. And it's just amazing open communication, understanding what their constraints are, understanding what our needs are. We have some of our, what we're calling self-help redesigns. We're simplifying some of our designs to help our suppliers have more throughput to us, whether it be with wire harnesses is a great example. And those are the kind of things that we've been executing on. A lot of those are going to come on in the back half of the year. So we've seen surprises before, but we're pretty confident that the back half is going to be better than what we've seen here, at least in the first half, which remains choppy. And our team is just doing an excellent job to managing this day-to-day. And if they have a problem, they triage it, they overcome it. We have incredible processes that we've set up now. And we're getting really, really sophisticated at executing when a problem does arise. Nigel Coe : Okay. Thanks. Dave Regnery : Sure Nigel. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. How are you? Thanks for fitting me in. Dave Regnery : Hey Andrew. How are you? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Andrew Obin : Just a question on, sort of, thinking about interest rates and the business model. Just, sort of, talking to folks in the channel, it seems that low interest rates impacted people's ability to carry more inventory, right, because floor financing is relatively inexpensive despite significant pricing on the resi side, right? A lot of folks are offering financing. Once again, rates are low. So instead of buying out right, you finance. You feel better about your purchase on the resi side. With interest rates going up, how do you guys think about changes to the business model? And how much impact is low interest rates have had on the channel over the past several years? An open-ended question, but just wondering if you guys have given any thought to that? Thanks. Chris Kuehn : Yeah, Andrew. I would say the short answer is, in the last three, six months, we're not really seeing much of a change in terms of demand based on changes in interest rates. There are financing options that are out there selling to the consumer and maybe coming at a little bit of a higher cost to a distributor today. But it's not changing the idea around the record demand and ultimately serving customers. So I would say we don't see that changing the business model. Looking backwards or even looking out over the next year, we don't see that really changing. Dave Regnery : Yeah. And Andrew, I would just add that even with interest rates, and I guess, we'll find out at 2 o\u2019clock at least, East Coast time today, what the Fed decides to do. But they're still pretty low rates comparably to historical norms. Andrew Obin : Right. No. That makes sense. And just a follow-up question. And look, clearly, execution stands out this quarter, and maybe we know why there were no chips left in Milwaukee. But just in terms of -- sorry, I lost my train of thought. Just in terms of thinking about pure transition, where are we? How much more visibility do we have into the year? And then how much pull-forward do you think we're going to get from 2023 on that? Thanks a lot. Dave Regnery : No problem. As far as the SEER transition, we don't see a big pre-buy. I think it really has to do with the way this year change is being executed with the south, at least at the AC level, it's an installed base. So it's not a manufacturing date, the North is a manufacturing date. So think of it more as a phase in, phase out of inventory that we'll see in the South. We're actually really good at this with all of our innovation. We're constantly doing phase in, phase outs within our own plants. So we're taking those chapters out of our business operating system and helping our distributors manage their inventory in a proactive way. We don't see a big pre-buy and we're certainly more than ready for this transition to higher SEER products. Andrew Obin : Terrific. Thanks a lot. Dave Regnery : No problem. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Hey. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Dave Regnery : Hey, Deane. Good morning. Deane Dray : Just a quick clarification, if we could. And we've seen your competitors do this, but not opening the 4Q order book till you get a better read on the material cost. Was that a TK specific? Dave Regnery : Yeah. Specifically, to Thermo King. Deane Dray : Right. And then what happens to customers in that situation? They just \u2013 you risk losing an order there? Do they wait \u2013 just what are the competitive dynamics? Dave Regnery : No. I think it's more about explaining to the customer that we're trying to ensure that, one, we can price it properly. But they're probably also getting constrained on another \u2013 from another OEM as well, whether it be a trailer or a tractor. So we're trying to help them marry that demand up. So slotting in this industry is not new. And it's not only Thermal King. It's also trailer as well as tractors that we're seeing some of that happen. So we're working with our customers. They know \u2013 these are \u2013 we have some pretty loyal customers in our Thermo King business, as you can imagine, with the innovations that we have in our products. So we haven't seen customers move away from that. They understand the reason why, and they're working with us as that dynamic continues to persist. Deane Dray : That's helpful. And just lastly, are you still executing the laddered purchasing of steel, copper, aluminum in the quarter where you would have 100% purchased ahead of time in the current quarter, 80% next quarter? Is that still the dynamic? And are you able fill those goals? Chris Kuehn : Yeah, Deane. For copper and aluminum, we are laddering out purchases and locking in quantities. But think of it as one quarter out, we're probably around 75%, 80% locked copper and aluminum, two quarters out. You're probably in that 60-ish, 50-ish percent range. And then three quarters, four quarters, that drops to about 25%, 30%. So we've continued to execute that through that here in this environment the last several years. We think that's a good process for us now to speculate steal with our forward buy and our mill by programs. We're generally locking in price for about six months. So looking out, any changes in price today would really have an impact for us really in the fourth quarter. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. Thank you. Operator : We have run out of time for the Q&A session on today's call. I will turn the call back over to Zach Nagle for closing remarks. Zach Nagle : Great. I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. As always, we'll be around to answer questions in the coming days and weeks. And we look forward to helping you to see you soon on the road, and be safe. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Zac, and everyone, for joining us on today's call. Let's turn to Slide #3. Before we dive into the quarterly results, I want to frame up the bigger picture, the strategy that enables Trane Technologies to deliver differentiated financial performance and shareholder returns.  First and foremost, we are driven by purpose. We love what we do because we are forging new ground for a better, healthier world. Our people take pride in knowing their work makes a real difference for our customers, for our communities and for the world.  Our purpose-driven strategy is aligned to mega-trends that are only getting stronger. We see the impact of climate change every day, including more frequent and intense weather events, like the heat waves we're experiencing in many parts of the world. These climate events have serious and far-reaching impacts on the economy, the environment and human health. We must act now to mitigate those impacts and ensure the health of our planet for the next generation.  Trane Technologies is proud to be leading our industry with bold sustainability commitments and action to back it up. Our innovation is accelerating decarbonization of commercial buildings, homes and transport.  Our customers recognize our innovation and our expertise, and we are their partner of choice in achieving sustainability goals while improving performance and efficiency. Demand has never been higher. Our purpose-driven strategy, relentless innovation and strong customer focus enables us to deliver superior growth profile through cycles. This, in turn, helps us drive strong margin and powerful free cash flow to deploy through our balanced capital allocation strategy. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our team, our customers, our shareholders and for the planet.  Moving to Slide #4. Q2 was another strong quarter for us. Our global teams faced adversity and leveraged our high-performance business operating system to deliver record results. Our innovation leadership is at the apex of secular mega-trends on energy efficiency and decarbonization, which is enabling us to win customers at an unprecedented pace. Our booking levels remained extremely high, reflecting strong share gains in virtually every area of our business.  In the second quarter, organic bookings were up 7%, reaching the highest level in the company's history at $4.6 billion. As a result, backlog also eclipsed prior records, rising to $6.5 billion, up 43% year-over-year and more than twice historical norms. On a 2-year stack, enterprise bookings were up 37% in Q2. This adds to a 2-year stack of up 37% in Q1. Our global commercial HVAC business is up 40% on a 2-year stack. The absolute booking levels we've delivered over the past 1.5 years have been extraordinary and have been broad-based across our portfolio.  Last quarter, I discussed the natural tendency to focus on bookings growth trends, but growth trends may be misleading when the absolute number moves step functions higher than any historical reference period, as they did in 2021. I encourage investors to consider absolute bookings and backlog in addition to bookings growth to get a fuller picture.  Even with our robust organic revenue growth of 11% in Q2, absolute bookings exceeded revenues with a strong book-to-bill of 111% and our backlog grew more than $300 million sequentially from Q1 to Q2. These results are even stronger when you consider that we are constraining bookings in our transport refrigeration business to help mitigate inflationary risks.  Absolute bookings levels and backlog provide us good visibility into future revenues, particularly in our nonresidential businesses. Our nonresidential businesses represent roughly 80% of our total revenue and closer to 90% of our total backlog and tends to be longer cycle. Strong execution of our business operating system has enabled us to stay ahead of persistent inflation and deliver over 10 points of price and positive price versus inflation again in the second quarter. This is a core competency for us and increasingly important given higher cost to serve customers across the value chain.  I'm especially proud of our team's performance, given 2 temporary plant closures we overcame in the quarter. We discussed the China COVID lockdowns on our first quarter call and our expectation to make this up in the second half, which is still the case. Our teams managed to minimize the revenue impact to approximately $60 million, better than the $80 million to $100 million range we anticipated at the time the lockdowns occurred. We also overcame a tornado that temporarily knocked out production at one of our North America transport refrigeration facilities in the quarter. The revenue impact to the quarter was also approximately $60 million. We expect to recoup the full impact in the second half of the year. We exited the quarter with both plants fully back up and running.  Our performance through the first half of the year has been stronger than we originally anticipated. Booking levels have remained robust. Backlog is significantly higher. Inflation has been persistent, but our pricing execution has more than kept pace. Supply chains remained tight, but we have seen some improvement and believe we have line of sight to further improvement in the second half of the year. All in, we're confident in raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.05 to $7.15. When you consider that our guidance includes an additional $0.06 headwind from FX, partially offset by a $0.01 tailwind from M&A, we're effectively raising our operational guidance by $0.10.  The secular mega-trends underpinning our strategy are only growing stronger. Execution of our high-performance business operating system and our unwavering focus on putting customers first remain at the core of everything we do. Our balance sheet, liquidity position and ability to deliver strong free cash flow provides a robust financial foundation and good optionality for capital deployment. We are exceptionally well positioned to not only navigate near-term macro challenges but to thrive as conditions improve. Please turn to Slide #5. As I discussed on the prior slide, we delivered the strongest booking quarter in our history in Q2, and the bookings growth was broad-based. Demand in our Americas Commercial HVAC business continues to top records and bookings were up mid-teens. 2-year stack bookings were up approximately 45%. Backlog is extremely strong, up over 70% year-over-year. commercial HVAC revenues were strong, up high single digits, with growth across equipment and services.  In residential HVAC, bookings were down mid-single digits versus a high 30s prior year comp. Absolute booking levels were resilient with 101% book-to-bill despite strong revenue growth.  Transport Americas bookings were healthy, up low teens, despite the fact that we are constraining bookings to mitigate inflationary risks. Non-constrained demand would be much stronger, but customers understand the dynamics and are working closely with us on slots. Revenues were down low single digits against a tough prior year comp, up nearly 70%, and were impacted by the extreme weather event I referenced earlier. This effectively shifted revenue from Q2 to the second half, mainly to Q4.  Turning to EMEA. We continue to see strong demand for our innovative products and services that help reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for our customers. EMEA commercial HVAC orders continue to be strong, up low teens, and revenues were up high single digits. As expected, transport bookings were down, in part due to tough prior year comps. And similar to our Americas transport business, we continue to constrain bookings through our order book to help mitigate inflationary risks. Revenues were up low teens, outpacing end markets.  Our Asia Pacific team delivered commercial HVAC bookings growth in the high teens and revenues were down due to COVID lockdowns in China, as discussed.  Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Christopher Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #6. Organic revenue growth of 11% in the quarter was strong despite the volume impacts from China's COVID lockdowns and a temporary plant shutdown related to extreme weather in Transport Americas that Dave mentioned earlier. FX was about a 2% headwind. Pricing was strong, up more than 10%, comprising the majority of the revenue growth this quarter. Price versus inflation was positive on a dollar basis and improved from the first quarter, but was still a margin headwind in the quarter. Productivity, mix and lower corporate expenses were favorable and we continue to make incremental business reinvestments to support innovation in the quarter. Organic leverage was solid at approximately 16%. All in, adjusted EBITDA and operating margins declined 40 and 20 basis points, respectively. Adjusted EPS grew 13%, driven primarily from strong operating performance and higher adjusted operating income. Please turn to Slide #7. We discussed the key revenue dynamics for each of the businesses earlier in the presentation, so I'll focus my comments on margins. Each of the businesses was heavily impacted by continued supply chain challenges and associated inefficiencies across our operations. In the near term, we are incurring higher costs to serve customers across the value chain, including significant investments in spot buys and expedited freight. Each segment also continued to make significant investments in our strong innovation pipeline. Our Americas segment delivered strong price, which offset inflation on a dollar basis, and modest volume growth with strong incrementals and solid productivity, leading to a modest decline in margins.  In EMEA, price was offset by inflation on a dollar basis, negatively impacting margins. Acute supply chain challenges are having an outsized impact on productivity in the region and are expected to improve as we move through the second half, as is price versus inflation.  In Asia Pacific, lower margins were primarily the result of lower revenues, which delevered at roughly the region's gross margin rate, consistent with our expectations. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide #8. As we've discussed throughout the call, underlying demand for our innovative products and services has never been higher, with unprecedented levels of bookings and backlog across our businesses. Relentless innovation and franchise brands with leading market positions, customer focus and operational excellence are hallmarks of our market outgrowth over a long period of time.  In North America, our commercial HVAC business is driving record demand and share gains demonstrated by our order growth of approximately 45% on a 2-year stack. And we're exiting the second quarter with another quarter of record backlog, up more than 70% year-over-year and more than double historical norms. End markets remain strong, with a variety of economic indicators pointing to growth in 2022. Unemployment is low, and indicators like the Architectural Billing Index, which has been over 50 since February of 2021, remain favorable. Demand remains strong in data centers, education and health care.  Every day, we see customers establishing their own sustainability targets. And we're partnering with them to create decarbonization road maps to achieve their targets through our customized system-based approach.  We're helping our K-12 customers deploy federal stimulus funds to improve the indoor air quality of schools. We see both decarbonization and indoor air quality as multiyear tailwinds for our business given our deep customer relationships and expertise. Demand for our residential products remained strong, with a book-to-bill of 101% despite strong revenue growth.  Turning to Americas Transport refrigeration. ACT projects continued market growth through 2023. We'll talk more about transport refrigeration outlook in our topics of interest section.  Turning to EMEA, while we have muted expectations for market growth with a volatile geopolitical backdrop continuing, demand for our sustainability-focused systems and services remain strong. And we continue to see good opportunities for market outgrowth and share gains.  Turning to Asia, we are monitoring the COVID lockdowns in China and their broader impact on the region. The business is healthy with strong bookings growth in the second quarter. Potential geopolitical and COVID-related risks have proven hard to predict for the region. For the year, we continue to see underlying strength in China's data center, electronics, pharmaceutical and health care markets.  Outside of China, the picture is mixed, with COVID-related lockdowns still impacting market expansion in some countries. Our direct sales model is differentiated in the region and provides good opportunities for market outgrowth in both equipment and services. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris to outline our updated full year guidance. Chris? Christopher Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #9. As Dave discussed at the outset of the call, we are pleased with our first half performance. In our second half outlook, strong backlog and pricing execution gives us confidence to raise our full year revenue and EPS guidance. We are raising our full year organic revenue growth guidance to approximately 12%, up from our prior guidance of 10%. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.05 to $7.15, which is higher by $0.05 at the midpoint. As Dave mentioned previously, this is $0.10 higher when you factor in the negative impact of FX, partially offset by M&A.  We continue to expect a stronger second half on revenue growth and leverage versus the first half, with an improving supply chain and product redesigns coming online that will help us serve our customers better and provide added resiliency to our supply chain. Organic leverage for the third quarter is expected to be similar to Q2 or around mid-teens. We expect free cash flow to remain strong and equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net income. Our outlook includes capital expenditures of approximately 2% of revenues across high-ROI projects in support of our profitable growth objectives and our sustainability commitments. These high-ROI projects include manufacturing automation, supply chain resiliency as well as investments to further decarbonize our operations. Our free cash flow outlook also includes modest investment in working capital, with a particular focus on strategic inventory to support continued growth.  Please go to Slide #10. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023. Importantly, we continue to invest these cost savings and high-ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio.  Please go to Slide #11. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value.  Please turn to Slide 12, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment in 2022. In the second quarter, we deployed $565 million in cash, with $155 million of dividends, $110 million for M&A and $300 million to share repurchases. Year-to-date, the company has deployed approximately $1.1 billion, of which $650 million was for share repurchases and we have approximately $3.7 billion remaining under current authorizations. We expect to continue to pay a competitive and growing dividend and to deploy 100% of excess cash to shareholders over time.  Turning to M&A. We completed a small channel acquisition in April and our M&A pipeline remains active. All in, we are on track to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash in 2022, inclusive of $1.9 billion between M&A and share repurchases. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality and dry powder moving forward.  Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please go to Slide #14. Overall, global transport refrigeration markets are expected to remain healthy in 2022. In North America, ACT has raised their 2022 forecast modestly, primarily reflecting actual builds coming in a bit stronger than expected in the first half. On balance, 2022 weighted average growth is expected to be up 10% versus up 8% prior. Growth is expected for 2023 as well.  Overall, the forecast for EMEA markets is relatively unchanged. The total market size has dropped year-over-year to reflect the removal of the Russian market. Russia comprises about 14% of EMEA market for trailers and trucks. Effectively removing Russia from the total available market for 3 quarters of 2022 lowers the market size for trailers and trucks by approximately 11% and the weighted average market size by approximately 6% for the year.  While the reduction in the total available market will impact our EMEA business growth in 2022, we continue to expect to drive growth through share gains and strong price realization across the region.  After clear share gains in truck, trailer and APU in both the Americas and EMEA in 2021, we're expecting global outgrowth and continued share gains in 2022 as well.  Please turn to Slide #15. We've updated the North America ACT trailer market growth outlook slide and added the 2024 forecast for reference. You can see that ACT continues to call for a 10-year average for North America trailers in the mid-40,000 unit range, with growth through 2023 and a modest step-down in 2024. IHS has not updated its outlook for EMEA beyond 2022 at this stage.  Please go to Slide #16. Energy efficiency, decarbonization and sustainability mega-trends continue to intensify and create record levels of demand for our innovative products and services. We are uniquely positioned to deliver leading innovation that addresses these trends and accelerates the world's progress, supported by our business transformation and our engaging, uplifting culture.  With the strength of our business operating system, we continue to successfully navigate macro challenges with a customer-first mindset. Our first half performance, record backlog and our outlook for the back half of the year give us confidence in raising our full year revenue and EPS guide.  We believe we have the right strategy, the best team and a solid foundation in place to deliver strong performance in 2022 and differentiated long-term shareholder returns.  And now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Andrew Kaplowitz : To your point of considering backlog at that $6.5 billion, up over 40% versus just orders, maybe you can give us your perspective in terms of the visibility that backlog gives you into '23 amidst the macro headwinds that everyone knows about. And then just in terms of that visibility, have you seen any slowing in core Americas commercial HVAC orders across any end markets given those concerns? David Regnery : Yes. I'll start with the orders and orders were very robust in the second quarter really, especially in the commercial HVAC business in Americas. It's really across all verticals, Andy. So we didn't see any soft spots there.  As far as the backlog, I mean our backlog right now is at record level, $6.5 billion. Our book-to-bill in the second quarter was 111%. We see a backlog entering 2023, it will be north of $6 billion. And that will give us great visibility into 2023, especially in our longer-cycle businesses, which are 80% of our backlog or 90% of our backlog, 80% of our business. Andrew Kaplowitz : Dave, that's helpful. And then maybe just digging a little bit, can you give us a little more color into the EMEA supply chain and the price/cost issues you've seen in that particular region? It's obviously a much smaller region for Trane than the Americas, but you've been hit hard there with supply chain issues, negative price versus cost. So what's the difference there versus in the Americas? And could you talk about your confidence in expected improvement, especially if Europe does fall into a bigger slowdown? David Regnery : Sure. Now I'll start with the positive. In our commercial HVAC, we continue to have a strong backlog in EMEA. Order rates were up low teens and we continue to see strong demand. Revenues was up high single digits, with growth in both equipment and services. Thermo King business also continues to perform well, with organic revenues up low teens, outpacing the markets.  We did see acute supply chain challenges in Europe and a higher cost to serve our customers with spot buys and expedited freight. However, we see these as investments, really good investments, especially with the demand for a thermal management system and the opportunities to minimize the need of fossil fuels for our customers.  Overall, I'm very confident long term with Europe. This region continues to grow share through leading innovation. Supply chain will improve in the back half, it's going to be a gradual improvement. And as it improves, the efficiencies in our factories will improve and we'll get our margins back on track. Operator : Your next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Maybe I'll make a suggestion first. It'd be great on topics of interest, maybe we take a look at services. We've done a lot of deep dive into the truck trailer market. But maybe we can start there. I mean services, up double digits. I remember when we used to think this was a mid-single-digit plus grower. Kind of what's happening there? And where do you think services can continue to grow? David Regnery : Yes. I mean we're very happy with our services business, and I'll take your suggestion in topics of interest. But our Service business over the last 5 years, and I'll speak globally, it's got a compound annual growth rate of high single digits, and that's over a 5-year period. In 2020, a pandemic year, we had -- our Service business was flat to 2019 despite the fact that we were constrained with getting access to facilities.  So very happy with our Service business. It's roughly 1/3 of our total business globally. And in the second quarter, it was -- again, it was up double-digit rates. So very happy with the performance there and a very resilient business. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe just starting on the price/cost conversation. Maybe just remind us if you think we can get some of the commodity deflation benefits here in the back half or if this is more of a 2023 story and kind of how you guys would think about the phasing of the lower commodity costs rolling through. Christopher Kuehn : Yes, John, it's Chris. I think it's going to be more of a 2023 story. Our practice has been, for a long time, to hedge and lock in on our main commodities for steel and copper and aluminum. 1 to 2 quarters out, we're 70-plus percent locked. And then 3 to 4 quarters out, we're 50% to 60% locked. And certainly, we're seeing the volatility in those markets, even in the second quarter, which looked like a bit of a pullback on steel and then a little bit of an uptick in terms of steel prices later in the quarter.  But we see that more of a 2023 tailwind, if we continue to see these commodities start to come down in terms of cost inputs. But at today's point, we're being selective on the backlog and making sure we're booking orders with as much visibility as we can get, so we price appropriately. And we're really happy with the price performance here in the second quarter and it being positive on a dollar basis in Q2 over cost. John Walsh : Great. Good quarter. And I'll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a first question around the operating leverage. So I think as you highlighted, you did sort of 16% in Q2. It sounds like Q3 is guided about the same. And so that implies a big step-up to sort of 35% plus in Q4. So maybe just confirm if that's correct. And I guess why in Q3 are you not seeing operating leverage improve if Asia is going from steep volume declines to a catch-up? And globally, you're probably over the hump in terms of price/cost headwinds and those should narrow. Christopher Kuehn : Julian, if I step back on the first half. Organic leverage was up about 12%, about 16% in Q2. So we saw a nice improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter. Back half of the year, we're expecting leverage to really be in the high teens, low 20s range. Our full year guide on leverage is consistent with what we said in May that it would be organically up mid-teens on a full year basis.  But we baked into the guide, as I think about the third quarter and the fourth quarter, Dave mentioned an improving but gradually improving supply chain. We baked into the guide that we're going to continue to see additional costs to serve our customers with spot buys and expedited freight. It's going to continue to cause factory disruptions certainly on a year-over-year basis, Q3, Q4. And while it does get a little bit better sequentially, it's going to be a little bit of a challenge to the leverage in the second half.  So it will be a gradual improvement, but that's where we thought Q3 would be, around that mid-teens level like we saw in Q2. And then Q4 would get a little bit stronger than that. Julian Mitchell : That's helpful. And then just sort of one follow-up around that. So when we're thinking about kind of third quarter earnings, probably sort of 10% or so growth year-on-year, mid-high teens leverage. So are we thinking sort of $2, that kind of earnings range? And then any sort of thoughts on resi HVAC? What's gone into that back half after a very strong Q2? Christopher Kuehn : Yes. I think for the third quarter, Julian, for the -- think about the second half revenue growth kind of in that low teens range. We see that growth roughly the same in Q3 and in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, roughly the same growth.  Now the third quarter comes with higher dollars of revenues. It's traditionally our strongest quarter of the year in terms of top line revenues. And then Q4 would come down off of Q3.  So revenue growth, roughly the same for the second half and the 2 quarters. Leverage in Q3, more around that mid-teens organic range and then it'll step up into the fourth quarter. And that's how we kind of see that second half playing out. David Regnery : Yes. And I'll chime in here on the second part of that question on resi. First of all, I'll start with the second quarter, and we had just -- the team did just a fantastic job in the second quarter. I mean we had 30% growth in the top line and our book-to-bill was 101%. So our backlog was flat with a 30% growth on the top line. We have tough compares all year in resi, with bookings level that we haven't seen before in 2021. So we'll have some tough compares going into the back half of the year. And for sure, we could see some negative bookings like we saw here in the second quarter. But you got to really look at the backlog, the book-to-bill and I couldn't be happier with our performance in our residential business to date. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : I want to switch gears and go back to M&A. It's always kind of a question of, is there another round of consolidation? Or what more can be done globally? And I know there's lots more opportunity perhaps outside of the U.S. But is your main pipeline in the distribution channel? Is that how we should think about it? Or is there more you think you can do down the road? David Regnery : Yes. I mean it's a great question. I mean, obviously, our M&A pipeline is full, as you would expect. We get to see all the opportunities being a large global player in HVACR. It's active. We don't just look at channel. We look really at any fits in the pipeline that's available. But I'd tell you that we don't need to do anything, as I've said before. We have great equipment portfolio, a great service portfolio, great access to channel. But we'll look and we're going to be patient and we're going to make sure that we make the right investments. Scott Davis : Okay. Fair enough. And just separately, really going back to the supply chain questions. Is it a broad list of components -- are hard to get? Or is it more specific stuff? I mean we have other companies who are just -- semiconductors and stuff. But you guys, is it a wide list of stuff that's kind of short? Or is it narrowing or a shorter list? David Regnery : Yes, good question. I mean our supply chain performed as expected during the second quarter and we anticipate, as I said earlier, a gradual improvement through the back half of the year. Our team continues to do an excellent job managing through this environment, working closely with our suppliers.  Yes, electronics still is a theme, okay? Chips have gotten somewhat better. We see progress working with our suppliers that, that's going to continue to get better in the back half. It's other components like wire harnesses, too.  But again, we're working through it. We have a great team. They're able to solve problems. And it's open communication with our suppliers and good things happen. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Can we just maybe on price/cost, I think you guys told us last quarter it was like roughly a 100 basis point impact to margins. I'm curious if you have that same color for Q2. And then whether that's supposed to get better in the second half of the year. And then I guess just maybe, just thinking through that resi growth number that you gave, the 30%. I'm just curious if you can give us how much of that was price as well. Christopher Kuehn : Joe, it's Chris. So as I think about the second quarter kind of price/cost, certainly, a margin headwind, you're right, we described Q1 as about 100 basis points. I would describe Q2 as less than 100 basis points from margin headwind. I don't want to dial it in any further than that.  We were happy with the performance on a net basis with turning dollar positive, really moderately positive in the quarter. And it's giving us even more confidence as we think about the balance of the year to be positive on a full year basis. So I think that's one of the most improved parts of our business operating system. And for the last 18 months, in a very highly inflationary environment, we've been able to stay on the right side of the price/cost equation and happy to see us deliver that here in the second quarter. The second part of your question was resi growth -- resi price. So yes, 30% growth in the quarter overall for resi. What we're going to report today, price for the enterprise was up 10.4%. We report in the Q that the Americas price was up about 11.8%. And I'll just say that resi was better than those averages here in the quarter in terms of price realization. Joseph Ritchie : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And a quick follow-up. I know last quarter, I think you talked about K-12 order rates really picking up. I think they were up 50% in the first quarter. I'm just curious like what -- did we see another step in the right direction on K-12 orders in Q2? David Regnery : Well, I'd start. The education vertical, Joe, has always been very strong for us and we continue to see stimulus funds flow there. Incoming order rates in the second quarter were very strong for the education vertical. They were north of 40%. So we continue to have -- show great progress there and we have a great process in place to help our customers track funds and to make sure that they're able to make the proper upgrades to their facilities. Operator : Your next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : I want to go to Europe first, if you don't mind. Pretty solid commercial HVAC bookings growth there and obviously a bit more macro uncertainty to say the least. Just wondering how much of this you guys feel is sort of driven by what's going on, i.e., like the energy paybacks, with prices just skyrocketing there. Or if this is just sort of stuff that had started through the process, maybe kind of pre Russia-Ukraine, and has just continued to go through? Like where are we in terms of 2Q kind of representing what's really going on in the market? David Regnery : Yes. I'd say that Europe has shown market outgrowth for a long period of time now with our innovations that we have, specifically around thermal management systems. Obviously, what's happening right now with the war in the Ukraine and the supply of energy into the rest of Europe from Russia, that's getting tighter. So it is a bit of a tailwind for sure, as our thermal management systems eliminate the need for fossil fuel. And so our original value proposition, which was extremely strong to our customers, just got stronger. And we think that will be a continued tailwind into the future. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the price/cost, everyone's trying to skin this cat a little differently. But I think in the applied business, there's kind of a less of a list price maybe go-to-market there and more of like a job bidding strategy. Like what's been the historical kind of ability to hold price or maintain that spread as commodities come in, understanding that it's less like a list phenomenon? Christopher Kuehn : Yes, Josh, what I would say is on those longer lead-type projects, first is the team is thinking about what does that future curve look like for commodities and costs when they're ultimately bidding the job. Some of those longer-term projects also allow for cost escalation, depending on an external index for which we can adjust price if something were to change after we bid it out.  But as I think about the whole company in a normal year, we go into the view of getting price/cost say 20 to 30 basis points positive. And with the commercial businesses being the largest part of the company, they're very much in that same ballpark of, in a normal year, getting positive price/cost. But then also having a lot of visibility as best we can into the forward curves of inflation and cost to price accordingly. David Regnery : Yes, Josh, if I could just add, we don't see pricing going down next year. I mean, price increases that we've seen over the last 18 months likely won't continue at the same rate into the future, but we don't see prices coming down. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Charles Tusa : Good execution in a choppy environment for sure. The -- just digging back into the resi, up 30%. What do you think your channel movement was? I know you guys are kind of 50-50 independent and captive. 30% is just like a pretty big number, obviously, relative to other guys that are reporting. So just curious as to if there were any differences between the channel and your more captive distribution. David Regnery : Yes. Good question. I mean we're really proud of the results we got in residential. I mean up 30%, you're right. And the good news there is -- the shocking there is that our book-to-bill was $101 million. So our backlog stayed flat as we enter Q3. Just to put some context around it, the sell-through in our IWDs was up in the 20s, right around 20% there. It was a little bit stronger in our own channel. So as far as inventory levels, they're about where we would expect them to be, Steve. We track that pretty carefully, especially our independent [Technical Difficulty] Charles Tusa : [Technical Difficulty] captive distributors. What percentage is like parts and pieces or non-equipment? David Regnery : I mean we're about a 50-50 shop, if that was your question. I'm not sure if you're going through like the parts side of our business, Steve? Or... Charles Tusa : Yes. Yes, just your captive distributors, if they do parts and services and things like that, the guys you own. David Regnery : The guys we own, absolutely. I mean we have -- they have part of that. I don't have the exact percentage in front of me, but we could dig that up for you. Charles Tusa : Okay. One follow-up, quick follow-up on commercial. What was light commercial up in the quarter for you, guys? David Regnery : Yes. It was -- our incoming order rates for light commercial was very strong. In the Americas, it was up over 30%. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe. Nigel Coe : So we've covered a lot of ground, but I just want to come back to residential. You're obviously -- extremely strong results. You did use the word dynamic. So I'm just wondering what sort of you're referring to there? Is that sort of the damage we're seeing elsewhere across the residential sector? Not HVAC, but across other end markets? So just wondering what dynamic would mean there. But really, this kind of punitive bill from the inflation protection bill had some provisions around subsidies for high-efficiency equipment. Just wondering kind of like how you do that and what that could do to the demand over the next 12 months or so. David Regnery : Yes. I mean, dynamic -- I mean it is a dynamic environment. Obviously, we've seen a lot of price there. We're seeing volume there as well. A lot of different things happening at the same time. And obviously, we have a backdrop of very, very strong compares from prior year. So that's kind of what we mean around the being a dynamic space.  As far as the IRA that's currently working its way through Washington, yes, there is a -- at least the way it's written right now, at least the pre-draft that I've seen, there is a provision in there for electrification of heating, right, which is in the heat pump space for the homeowner. So that could be a tailwind for sure if that goes through. But we'll see -- we'll wait and see how that gets written and let the final proposal goes to Congress and to the Senate. Nigel Coe : Fair enough. No, that's good. And then my follow-up is on the buyback cadence. You've done $750 million of -- well, $750 million or thereabouts of buyback and M&A, so it's a bit more of a back-end load, that $1.9 billion. Just given the share price sort of through the second quarter, I thought I might see a bit more buyback activity during the quarter. So just wondering if there's any restrictions on buybacks during the quarter. Was there some M&A activity potential during the quarter? But just wondering on the cadence there. Christopher Kuehn : Nigel, I would say we're kind of looking at this quarter by quarter as we go through the year. You're right, about $750 million of deployment between M&A and share repurchases so far this year and about $1.1 billion left to go when you already account for dividends that will be paid out in the second half. So I think to Dave's point, the pipeline remains active in M&A. Certainly, by the end of the year, I'd like to see 1 or 2 transactions closed or committed to by the end of the year. So we're just trying to make sure we leave some powder for that.  At the same time, our balance sheet is, as you know, very strong. We got a lot of capacity here to do a lot of different things with the cash we have. But I'd say at this point, the share price continues to look very favorable and trading well below our calculated intrinsic value, so we would continue to deploy cash to shares if M&A isn't available as we think about Q3 to Q4.  Let me, if I could -- Nigel, I want to go back to a comment that Julian made earlier around leverage. And I think for the third quarter, we commented that it would be around mid-teens, similar to Q2. It could be a little better than that as we work through the quarter. So the EPS estimate, Julian, we put out of around $2, I think that could be a little higher than that, maybe it's closer to $2.10 range than it is the $2 range. And that would come with a little bit of stronger leverage, probably not above 20%, but maybe it could be higher teens, in the mid-teens, would be the range I'd be thinking about for Q3. Thanks for letting me add that. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeffrey Sprague : Dave, can you just address lead times? And not lead times in your own supply chain but just kind of the customer order behavior. We've seen across really the spectrum here that customers are ordering further in advance. So I wonder if you could kind of just address that. Are orders being booked further in advance than typical? And what is it that you're doing on kind of price and other things to make sure you're protecting yourself on the kind of longer tail on some of these orders? David Regnery : Yes. I mean I think the answer is yes, they are getting booked sooner, and that's -- there's 2 reasons for that. One is our customers want to make sure we have enough visibility. And the second is that our lead times out of our factories are longer with all of our backlog. So yes, that is a fact.  As far as how we're protecting ourselves from the pricing, some of the longer lead items, we would actually put in escalations on. That's a portion of the business, it's not the entire business. Jeffrey Sprague : And -- but you don't do that for transport? What is the difference for all the transport orders? David Regnery : Yes. That's not -- we don't do that in our transport business. There, we basically -- we'll go out like a quarter or 6 months at a time to fill the backlog. We'll control that. It's not that we're not working with our customers on slots. We just won't be able to price it until we, in fact, get to a point in time. So like we have not yet opened up 2023 yet for orders. Now we're talking with our customers, so we understand what their demands might be so we'll slot it, so we make sure we don't disappoint them. We're just unable to price it at this time.  We just want to make sure we -- in that business, it's very difficult to go back and say, we'll have to reprice something. And it's been very volatile. So we just want to be conservative in that -- from that standpoint and make sure we have the right price on the product. Jeffrey Sprague : And maybe just finally for me, just more kind of big picture cycle. You're -- sort of your call on resi from here, right? You're well aware of the debate and the replacement cycle, but it's hotter and we're running them longer and SEER changes. There's kind of a whole mix of things going on. When you look forward into '23 and '24, I mean do you see a legitimate argument for resi to stay at least on a relatively high plateau? Or do you think there's some kind of impact that we need to get here cyclically? David Regnery : Yes. It's pretty dynamic, Jeff. I'll start with that. As I said earlier, I think the other variable that you may want to put into your model there is the SEER change that will be coming in 2023. Remember, that's going to be -- depending on the model, that would be 10% to 15% on the top line. I wouldn't expect it to be -- expect margins to be neutral on that because, obviously, the product costs more for the higher-SEER product. So that's another tailwind on the top line that we'd be seeing.  It's -- we haven't come up with our guide yet for 2023. We're working through our planning process now. We have -- as I said before, we have very detailed models in this space. And when we come up with a guide for 2023, we can explain to you in a lot of detail as to what's happening. But remember, I sound like a little bit of a broken record here. But residential is only 20% of our total business. So even if it did fall by 10%, it'd be a 2% drop for the enterprise. And the opportunities that we see in our commercial businesses on both Thermo King and our Trane commercial business far exceed the 2%. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Sabrina Abrams : You have Sabrina Abrams on for Andrew Obin. So first, I wanted to ask another question on Europe and sort of how the conversation on HVAC is changing in Europe given the recent weather. And in the longer term, what it means for your organization in Europe and what you need to do to be better positioned in Europe in order to get positioned for new climate trends. David Regnery : Yes. Well, first of all, I think we're very well positioned with some of the latest innovation that we've introduced into the marketplace with our thermal management systems. So -- and I think that as you could eliminate the need for fossil fuels and buildings, that's -- the value proposition was already great, it just got even better. These products are significantly more efficient than conventional ways of thinking, which would have been a separate chiller plant and boiler plant. We now have technology that combine these. Your efficiency is up between 2 and 4x, depending on what your heat sink is. So we're very happy with our position there and we're seeing a lot of traction. Sabrina Abrams : Cool. And just quickly on the 2023 SEER change, can you talk about where you are in terms of transitioning production to the new high-SEER equipment? David Regnery : Yes. We're certainly ready. We're well equipped for this. We already sold all the higher-SEER product prior to the change. So we're in good shape there. Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam Khanna : I had a couple of questions. One, nothing you said on the call would point people to worry in the commercial markets at least about a slowdown. But I'm curious, can you comment on the front log? Some of the project pipeline, is there any timing slips related to any funding issues that you're seeing emerge even anecdotally more so than was the case maybe a year ago or 3 months? I mean is there any sign... David Regnery : I'm assuming your question is more slanted towards the Americas, but it's been strong. I mean if you look at the Architectural Billing Index, which is a good macro indicator to look at, I mean, it's been over 50 now for 17 months. So we continue to see strength in the Americas. We have nice strength in EMEA, as we already talked. And it was a good trend we had in Asia in the second quarter with our order rates there up in the 16% range. So overall, lots of strength. And if you look at the longer-term macro trends, I would say it's going to be with us for a while. Gautam Khanna : And then secondly, we talked a little bit about raw material, copper, steel, aluminum. What about components broadly in terms of cost next year? Do you guys -- are you seeing inflation in those continuing and maybe offsetting whatever benefit we get from raws? Or do you think it's a net positive as we stand today on the cost side? Christopher Kuehn : Gautam, we track -- for these calls and others, we generally spend a lot of time on Tier 1, but we track everything on the Tier 2 which would be the components you described from electrical components to motors to metal fabrication. And we're tracking that on the input costs from the commodities to that but also impacts on labor costs and others. But as it stands right now, with things looking a bit more deflationary at this point versus, say, 3 months ago, 6 months ago, for us, it's really kind of looking as more of a benefit and a tailwind in 2023. Locking in steel, we locked that in for really 6 months, so a cost in June is really going to be realized in December. So any type of pullbacks we see in deflation here in the third quarter, that really carries over into the first quarter of next year for steel.  And then we've got the locking mechanisms in place with respect to copper and aluminum that also really push any change in price out roughly at least 3 to 6 months. So I think it represents a tailwind if we continue to see a deflationary environment. I think that's also a dynamic where it's hard to tell which way the market is going. But we're really just making sure we follow a process where we hedge each and every quarter out to a similar level. So we smooth any type of increases on the way up, and that means also a bit of a smoothing on the way down if we see deflation. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. Deane Dray : A question on data centers. Just what kind of growth rate are you baking in? And a bit of a technical question. Do you see any threat to the growth in liquid cooling in data centers? Is this going to take share? Or can they both coexist and not affect each other's growth path? David Regnery : Yes. I'll start with the latter there. The liquid cooling is certainly emerging technology that we're certainly doing a lot of work with. And we'll see how that moves forward. So we are aware of the technology and some of our scientists are looking at that very closely.  As far as the -- we saw a nice growth in data centers. I don't have the exact number in front of me, we can dig that up for you. But we continue to see nice growth in data centers. I think your understanding -- it's part of the office vertical, so it gets a little bit complicated. But we continue to have a nice growth there. We have dedicated teams that work on data centers because there's a specific expertise there that we have that we work with our customers on. Deane Dray : Got it. And then as a follow-up on indoor air quality, we talked about the education market. But do you still feel good about that broad estimate of a 10-year path, 200 basis points annual top line?  And then just another more technical question. There was, a year ago, lots of focus on air disinfection technologies. That seems to have waned a bit. But just give us a sense of what's the take rate in businesses, offices that are using disinfection technologies? David Regnery : Yes. I mean, first of all, we see indoor air quality as a long-term secular mega-trend for the industry. And we continue to see growth there in lots of different verticals, okay? It's not just in health care we have -- we're doing indoor air quality. We're continuing to do indoor air qualities in several different verticals, including education, office as well as health care.  As far as the cleaning of the air, products like dry hydrogen peroxide product, we continue to sell, we continue to see demand for. So we don't see it waning. We think that indoor air quality is going to be top of mind for our customers for the foreseeable future.  It's generally embedded in our applied systems as well as our controls and our services, so it's harder to track as a stand-alone item. But we continue to see it as a growth tailwind for the -- for our business and really for the whole industry. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zachary Nagle : I would like to thank everyone for joining today's call, and we'll be around for questions in the coming days and weeks as always. And we look forward to seeing you on the road, hopefully in person, in the near future. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zachary Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Zac, and everyone, for joining us on today's call. Let's turn to Slide number three. Before I dive into our quarterly results, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which is the engine behind our differentiated financial performance and shareholder returns. Our strategy is aligned to powerful megatrends, like climate change and the crucial need for climate action. Last week, United Nations released its emission GAAP report 2022, calling for urgent transformation to avoid climate disaster. The report cites critical actions needed, including efforts to scale 0 emission heating and cooling technologies and to decarbonize the food supply chain. That's where Trane Technologies has a unique position to make a difference. We have the technology today to transform tomorrow. We are proud to be leading our industry with aggressive, science-based sustainability commitments, actions and results. Together with our customers, we are dramatically reducing emissions and creating sustainable homes, buildings and cities. Our purpose-driven strategy, relentless innovation and strong customer focus enables us to deliver a superior growth profile through cycles. This, in turn, helps us drive strong margin and powerful free cash flow to deploy through our dynamic capital allocation strategy. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our team, our customers, our shareholders and for the planet. Moving to Slide number four; Q3 was another strong quarter for us across the board. Our innovation leadership continues to win customers at an unprecedented pace, and our bookings level remained extremely high, reflecting strong share gains in virtually every area of our businesses. Organic revenues were very strong, up nearly 20% and our book-to-bill remained over 100% with organic bookings up 8%. Absolute demand continues to be extremely robust. For perspective, year-to-date, organic bookings are 95% of our total revenues for 2021, and we still have the fourth quarter to go. Bookings continue to be particularly strong in commercial HVAC businesses globally. Our global commercial HVAC business is up more than 40% on a two-year stack. Our Americas commercial HVAC business is even stronger, up more than 50% on a two-year stack. Strong broad-based bookings growth over the past seven quarters have driven our backlog to unprecedented levels with backlog of $6.4 billion at the end of the third quarter. We expect backlog to remain at elevated levels well into 2023. Strong execution of our business operating system has enabled us to stay ahead of persistent inflation and deliver over 10 points of incremental price and positive price versus inflation again in the third quarter. Pricing execution is a core competency for us and increasingly important given higher cost to serve customers across the value chain. On our second quarter earnings call, we discussed two temporary plant closures that delayed $120 million in revenue from the second quarter into the second half of 2022, with the majority of the revenues expected to be recovered in the fourth quarter. I'm proud of the way our teams rose to the challenge to accelerate that recovery in the third quarter to meet or exceed our customers' needs. As a result, we successfully recovered $100 million of the $120 million in the third quarter, which is approximately $70 million ahead of our expectations, and we're on pace to deliver the additional $20 million in the fourth quarter. . Our performance through the third quarter has been strong. Booking levels have remained robust. Backlog remains at unprecedented levels. Inflation has been persistent but our pricing execution has more than kept pace. Supply chain remains tight, but are slowly improving. All in, we're confident in raising both our organic revenue and adjusted EPS guidance above the high end of our previous ranges. When you consider that our guidance includes an additional $0.07 of headwind from FX, we're effectively raising our operational guidance for the year by about $0.15 at the midpoint. The secular megatrends underpinning our strategy are only growing stronger. Execution of our high-performance business operating system and our unwavering focus on putting customers first remain at the core of everything we do. Our balance sheet, liquidity position and ability to deliver strong free cash flow provides a robust financial foundation and good optionality for capital deployment. We are well positioned to not only navigate near-term macro challenges, but to thrive as conditions improve. Please turn to Slide number five. As I discussed on the prior slide, both bookings and revenue growth were strong and broad-based in the quarter. America's commercial HVAC was again a standout with organic bookings on a 2-year stack up more than 50%. Continued strong bookings have driven our Americas commercial HVAC backlog to new heights, up more than 70% year-over-year and more than 200% of historical norms. Commercial HVAC revenues were also strong with low teens growth in both equipment and services. In residential HVAC, revenues were robust, up 16% in the quarter. Bookings were down 8%, consistent with our expectations. As bookings continue to normalize towards a GDP plus profile that we see for our long-term outlook. Still, our book-to-bill was 92% in the quarter and backlog remains at historically high levels. We just opened the first half of 2023 order book for our transport refrigeration Americas business in September, and bookings were strong out of the gate, up high single digits for the quarter. Growth is consistent with our expectations as we've been working with customers on slotting throughout the year. Transport refrigeration revenues were very strong, up nearly 60%. Our team has done a terrific job of ramping up operations at the plant that was impacted by extreme weather in the second quarter and accelerating the recovery of delayed Q2 revenues into the third quarter. When we held our Q2 call, we expected the team to recover about $10 million of the $60 million in revenues in Q3 with the balance in Q4. The team delivered the entire $60 million in the quarter, effectively accelerating the recovery of $50 million in revenues into the third quarter and enabling us to meet or exceed our customers' expectations. If we exclude the shift in revenues from the fourth quarter into the third quarter, third quarter revenues were still extremely strong, up more than 40%. We're on pace for significant share gains in 2022, adding to strong share gains the team delivered in 2021. Turning to EMEA. We continue to see strong demand for our innovative products and services that help reduce energy intensity and greenhouse gas emissions for our customers despite the challenging macro backdrop. EMEA commercial HVAC orders were up low teens, and revenues were up in the mid-20s, reflecting strong demand across the portfolio, particularly for our thermal management systems, which are 3 to 4x more efficient than conventional heating and cooling. EMEA transport refrigeration orders declined consistent with our expectations, mainly due to tough comps in the quarter. Additionally, we've been carefully managing our order book to mitigate inflationary impacts and therefore, just opened our order book in September for the first half of 2023. Revenues were up high single digits, significantly outpacing end markets. Overall, backlog for the region remains strong, approximately 40% higher than historical norms. In Asia Pacific, commercial HVAC bookings growth continued to be strong, up low teens. The team has delivered organic bookings growth between low teens and low 20s in each of the past 6 quarters. Asia Pacific revenues were strong, up 28%. Similar to transport refrigeration Americas, our team has done a terrific job accelerating the recovery of delayed revenues due to a temporary plant closure from COVID-19-related lockdowns in China in the second quarter. When we held our Q2 call, we expected the team to recover about $20 million of the $60 million in delayed revenues in Q3 with the balance in Q4. The team rallied and delivered $40 million in the quarter, effectively accelerating the timing of recovery of $20 million in revenues into Q3. If we exclude the shift in revenues from the fourth quarter into the third quarter, third quarter revenues were still strong, up mid-teens. Overall, backlog for the region remains strong, approximately 50% higher than historical norms. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Christopher Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number six. This slide does a nice job encompassing our overall performance in the quarter, which was strong across the board. Organic revenue growth was up 19%, adjusted EBITDA margins were up 50 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 26%. We delivered robust enterprise growth in both equipment and services, up more than 20% and low teens, respectively. EBITDA and operating margin expansion was driven primarily by strong leverage on volume growth. Pricing remained strong, up more than 10% in the quarter, and price versus inflation was positive on a dollar basis. Productivity continues to be negatively impacted by supply chain challenges driving plant inefficiencies as well as higher costs to serve customers. We also continue to make high levels of business reinvestment to support continued innovation and product leadership across our product portfolio. Organic leverage was strong at approximately 21%. Please turn to Slide number seven. We discussed the key revenue dynamics for each of the businesses earlier in the presentation, so I'll focus my comments on margins. In addition to the items discussed below, each of our segments also continued to make significant investments in our innovation pipeline to fortify our leading brands and drive market outgrowth. In our Americas segment, we delivered solid margin expansion, driven primarily by strong incrementals on robust volume growth. Price offset inflation on a dollar basis but remained a margin headwind. Margins were also negatively impacted by the supply chain challenges and higher costs to serve customers that I referenced earlier. In EMEA, strong volume growth with solid incrementals was more than offset by foreign exchange impacts and continued acute supply chain challenges, which continue to have an outsized impact on productivity in the region. Price versus inflation improved sequentially and was positive on a dollar basis but remained a margin headwind. In Asia Pacific, margins expanded over 300 basis points on robust volume growth with strong incrementals, more than offsetting FX headwinds. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number eight. We discussed throughout the call underlying demand for our innovative products and services has never been higher with unprecedented levels of bookings and backlog across our businesses. Relentless innovation, strong brands with leading market positions, customer focus and operational excellence are hallmarks of our market outgrowth over a long period of time. . In the Americas, our commercial HVAC business is driving strong demand and share gains, as demonstrated by our order growth of approximately 50% on a 2-year stack, and we're exiting the third quarter with another quarter of record backlog, up more than 70% year-over-year and more than 200% of historical norms. End markets remain strong with a variety of economic indicators pointing to growth in 2022. Unemployment is low, and indicators like the Architectural Billing Index remained favorable with a reading of over 50 since February of 2021. Demand remains strong in data centers, education, health care and high-tech industrial verticals, where we have strong customer relationships and market positions. Our commercial HVAC business is underpinned by long-term secular tailwinds of energy efficiency, decarbonization and indoor environmental quality. We also see tailwinds from new and ongoing regulatory and policy-related drivers, such as Inflation Reduction Act and education stimulus. Our commercial HVAC business has a lot of runway, and we believe we have the premier franchise to capitalize on significant opportunities that lie ahead. Demand for our residential products remained healthy with a book-to-bill of 92% combined with 16% revenue growth in the third quarter. We expect bookings and revenue to normalize over time and for regulatory and policy-related tailwinds, such as the upcoming SEER change and the Inflation Reduction Act to help buffer potential market declines. Longer term, we continue to see residential HVAC as a GDP-plus business, which makes up about 20% of our portfolio. Turning to Americas transport refrigeration. ACT continues to project solid growth in 2022, followed by a relatively flat 2023, where the market is expected to remain at a high level. We have a diversified portfolio of solutions across a number of vertical markets, which provide opportunities and continued growth prospects through further market penetration and share gains. Longer term, we continue to see transport refrigeration as a GDP-plus-plus business for us. We'll talk more about the transport refrigeration outlook in our topics of interest section. Turning to EMEA commercial HVAC. While we have muted expectations for overall market growth, given the volatile geopolitical backdrop, demand for our leading sustainability-focused solutions remains strong. We continue to see good opportunities for market outgrowth and share gains across the region, and we're seeing great traction and growth across our Thermal Management Systems portfolio. Looking at EMEA transport refrigeration, the market is expected to be down roughly mid-single digits in 2022, primarily reflecting the removal of Russia from the market sizing. Looking out to 2023, we expect the market to be down modestly, reflecting economic uncertainty in the region. We're continuing to work closely with our customers as the market evolves. Turning to Asia; we continue to see strength in data center, electronics, pharmaceutical and health care verticals. Outside of China, the picture is mixed, with varying dynamics country to country. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris? Christopher Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number nine. As Dave discussed at the outset of the call, we are pleased with our execution through the first 3 quarters of the year, and we continue to see slow but steady improvement in our supply chain. Additionally, bookings and backlog continue at high levels, providing us with good visibility into future revenues. All in, we're confident in once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance for 2022. We are raising our full year organic revenue growth guidance to between 13% and 14%, up from our prior guidance of 12%, reflecting both stronger price and volume for the year. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $7.15 to $7.20, from a range of $7.05 to $7.15, which is an increase of about $0.07 at the midpoint. As Dave mentioned previously, our updated guidance includes an additional $0.07 headwind from FX for the year that we are absorbing in our guidance, which means our core guidance range is effectively higher by about $0.14 to $0.15 at the midpoint. Our full year organic leverage expectations are unchanged at mid-teens. While we continue to see our supply chain slowly improving, it remains challenging and continues to pressure productivity in our plants and drive higher costs to serve customers as we've discussed previously. As a result, we're expecting similar to modestly improved leverage in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter or between 20% and 25%. We expect free cash flow to remain healthy and are targeting 100% of adjusted net income for the year. Depending upon the timing of revenue and shipments as we close out the year, we could see some receivables carry over into 2023, which could modestly impact the timing of our cash conversion. Other elements of our guidance remain largely unchanged. One last item I wanted to highlight relates to our guidance cadence. As Dave discussed earlier, when we raised our guidance on our second quarter call, we envisioned recouping about $30 million of the $120 million in delayed revenues related to the second quarter plant closures in the third quarter, and recouping the other $90 million in revenues in the fourth quarter. We're extremely pleased we were able to accelerate this recovery plan and recoup $100 million in revenues in the third quarter, $70 million ahead of our guidance expectations. The net effect is a modest shift in the timing of $70 million in revenues or approximately $0.07 of adjusted EPS into the third quarter from the fourth quarter, with no impact to the full year. Please see Page 17 of the presentation, which provides additional details related to guidance to assist with your models. Please go to Slide number 10. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023. We continue to invest in these cost savings in high-ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio. It's important to note that our transformation savings program is a discrete program related to recovering 3x the amount of stranded costs we expected to see as a result of the separation of our industrials business. Our business operating system is designed to drive continued strong productivity and cost savings over the long term, and we have a long track record of success over the past 10-plus years. Our relentless focus on executing our business operating system and driving productivity and cost savings continues long after the discrete transformation program has achieved its targets. Please go to Slide number 11. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide 12, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment in 2022. In the third quarter, we deployed $406 million in cash, with $156 million in dividends and $250 million to share repurchases. Year-to-date through October, the company has deployed approximately $1.6 billion, with $900 million of share repurchases, $467 million dividends and approximately $250 million to M&A., including the acquisition of AL-KO Air Technology, which closed on Monday, October 31. We continue to target the deployment of approximately $2.5 billion of capital in 2022. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we have significant firepower for share repurchases with approximately $3.5 billion remaining under current share repurchase authorizations. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality and dry powder moving forward. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number 14. Overall, global transport refrigeration markets are expected to remain healthy in 2022. Forecast for 2022 are largely unchanged versus the last quarter, with strong growth in North America and a mid-single-digit decline in EMEA, largely driven by the removal of Russia from the market sizing. For 2023, forecast have softened a bit versus the prior quarter. ACT is now projecting roughly flat growth from 2022 to 2023 with the overall market remaining at a high level. In EMEA, while IHS has yet to publish an official outlook for 2023, we expect the market to be down modestly based on a softening European economic backdrop. After clear share gains in truck, trailer and APU in both the Americas and EMEA in 2021, we're expecting continued share gains in 2022. For 2023, we have strong and diversified portfolios in both North America and EMEA and see opportunities for growth and share gains across our portfolio. Please go to Slide number 15. In summary, we are positioned to outperform consistently. Energy efficiency, decarbonization and sustainability megatrends continue to intensify and create record levels of demand for our innovative products and services. We are uniquely positioned to deliver leading innovation that addresses these trends and accelerates the world's progress, supported by our business transformation and our engaging uplifting culture. The strength of our business operating system, the power of our global team and our broad-based market demand gives us confidence in raising our full year revenue and EPS guide. We believe we have the right strategy, the best team and a solid foundation in place to deliver strong performance in 2022 and differentiated long-term shareholder returns. And now we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Dave, can you give us more color into the commercial HVAC bookings environment in the Americas. It looks like your bookings actually accelerated a bit in Q3. Could you talk about the biggest drivers of that bookings growth at this point and the visibility of continued strong bookings? How much of the good growth is the impact from institutional customers, maybe starting to reach day two spend in IQ? Have you seen any customers begin to pull back on spend yet? And are you seeing any major differences between applied and unitary? David Regnery : Yes. Well, we haven't seen any pull back, Andy. Good question. But we're seeing broad-based demand, electronics, data centers, education, health care, high-tech industrial, think of electronics, EV plants, battery plants. So we're seeing some nice demand. I mean our order rates were up around 20% in the Americas, and it's really across many verticals. So a lot of strength there. Andy Kaplowitz : Great. And then maybe a similar question on resi. I know you don't want to give us exact forecast for '23, but bookings down high single digits, in line with what you guys thought. But pricing still very strong. Have you seen any weakness in replacement volume at this point? You kind of said that you didn't expect it to fall off a cliff. How is that going? What about inventory in the channel? And are you still measuring your resi backlog in months that gives you decent visibility, especially with CR change in '23? David Regnery : Yes. Our resi business had a very strong third quarter with strong mid-teens organic revenue growth. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 92%. Channel inventory in our independent wholesale distributor channel was a bit higher than normal, but nothing alarming. Sell-through in the independent channel was mid-teens. So it was strong. Order rates will be under pressure here in the short term as we think about this backlog that we're still measuring in months as it starts to normalize. And Andy, if you remember in 2021, our order rates for our resi business on a full year basis were up around 30%. And our revenue was up like 14%. So we built this really large backlog that we'll need to process through. And you really need to look at -- when you think about residential, we really look at 3 different elements. One is what's your order rate. Two is, what's your backlog and then obviously, the revenue. And those 3 will start to neutralize themselves over time. But longer term, we see our residential business as a GDP-plus business, and they had a very strong third quarter for us. Christopher Kuehn : Andy, I'll add on the enterprise backlog. We reported of $6.4 billion. We still see that 90% is nonresidential. It's focused on our commercial businesses, including thermal, so it will stay the same here in the third quarter. David Regnery : We do not see resi falling off a cliff. There's going to be some positive tailwinds to next year. You have the SEER change that will happen, which will drive some price. You also have IRA, which we're still working through. There's some elements there that still need to be defined. But that will be a tailwind. Hopefully, that starts towards the beginning of the second quarter. So there is some positive too in residential. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. John Walsh : Congrats on the nice quarter. . David Regnery : Thanks, John. Appreciate it. . John Walsh : I'm going to take a stab at it. So you have incredibly strong backlog. You've opened up the order book at Thermo King, services continues to grow nice just -- anything you can give us in terms of maybe how you think the market develops into '23? Or just how much more visibility you have today than you would normally have going into a year? David Regnery : Yes. I think with the backlog of $6.4 billion, it gives us a lot of visibility. If you think about a normal fiscal year, John, we typically go in with about 20% of our revenue in the backlog. Obviously, we're going to go into 2023 with a much larger number, which really is going to help us, too, with our forecasting capability with our suppliers. The supply base is still constrained. It's improving. The third quarter was certainly better than the second quarter. The fourth quarter will be better than the third quarter. But it is going to be constrained for a period of time. But having that visibility really helps us, helps our suppliers, helps us with our forecasting capability. John Walsh : Great. And then maybe just on the margin. Price cost still positive on absolute dollars. I think you said it's still a headwind to the margin. Just as you think about price flowing into next year, maybe also what you're seeing on inflation, just maybe give us some expectations for price costs and when it flips positive on a margin percent. Christopher Kuehn : Yes, John, you summarized it well. The third quarter price cost positive on a dollar basis, still a margin headwind, but less of a margin headwind in Q3 than what we saw in Q2. So it is getting a little bit better. As we think about 2023, we'll certainly see some carryover price coming into next year. We're seeing those commodities start to come down off of their peaks. Certainly not back where we were two years ago in terms of commodity costs, but a little bit of deflation there. We see that impacting 2023, more so than 2022. But we also are looking at items like wage inflation and energy inflation as well that we'll need to bundle all together, and we'll provide a better look on 2023 in a few months when we report our Q4 earnings. But there should be some deflationary opportunities in there. We're going to have, as Dave mentioned, a very strong backlog entering into 2023. And ultimately, the goal here is to deliver top quartile results. Operator : We'll take our next question from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : If you think back to kind of prior housing recessions, we saw a bit of a double mix shift, a mix shift down to lower end units and a mix shift towards more repair versus replace. What -- given the SEER changes that are coming in, in '23 and perhaps maybe change in kind of how dealers have taken inventory and stuff. What do you -- do you see a similar potential or muted impact? It sounds from your prepared remarks like perhaps a more muted impact, but maybe some color on why would be helpful. David Regnery : Yes. I think it will be a little bit more muted. I think that there's obviously the SEER change, which we are in the process, obviously, of shipping the new products as we speak. So that's going to add some price. It's also going to push up the higher end of the SEER market. I also think that IRA will be a tailwind. Again, we're working through some of the details on that still need to be defined. But that will certainly push the market more to the heat pump side of things and the higher SEERs on the heat pumps. Scott Davis : Okay. And switching gears, I see your releases, press releases plus kind of trade magazines, the next generation of products in Thermo King. Where is that mark -- I mean help us understand kind of the demand from the customer for next-generation product, and in particular, really, where is that technology going? Is it going to a hybrid or all battery and when, I suppose, is another way to add? David Regnery : Good question. We don't have totally the crystal balls there, but I would tell you that it is moving to electrification, okay? You're seeing it in the smaller vehicles now. And we have a complete portfolio of products there that are able to capture that market. On the long-haul carriers, think about the reefer units, that will be a slower transition but we're ready for it. We actually have products that are out now. We're testing in the field with customers that are fully electric. It will take an approach very similar probably to what you've seen with cars where you'll start with hybrid and then it will move to an all-electric version. Operator : We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Just wanted to start with the Thermo King outlook. So you've got that very helpful Slide 14. Just when we're thinking about next year, it looks like, as you said, the sort of third-party market forecast and so forth are sort of flat to down units in 2023. So I just wondered about how would you sort of frame the scope for Thermo King overall transport that Trane to do better than that. What's the outlook for that one third of revenue, which is sort of marine, bus, rail and aftermarket? How is pricing in transport for you versus the Trane enterprise? Any thoughts on share gain potential, perhaps after some undergrowth in North America this year? Any sort of color on that, please. David Regnery : Yes. I would say that our Thermo King business, I'll start in the Americas. It's performed very well for a number of quarters consecutively. Very strong quarter, obviously, in the third quarter, as we saw the revenue that we missed in Q2. The team was able to pick that up in Q3, just a great effort there by that team. As far as share gains, we're very happy with our share gains in our Thermo King business. Outlook for 2023, we like the innovation that we've been able to drive in that business in really both regions -- both EMEA and in the Americas. And it's really helping us with those share -- our share position. So 2023 in the Americas, ACT has got a relatively flat to 2022, but understand that's at a very, very high level. They're forecasting the trailer market to be -- the last number I saw was like 45,000, which is a very, very robust market. And in Europe, we haven't seen an official forecast from IHS. We're estimating that it's going to be down modestly, but don't assume that, that means that our business will be down, okay? We have some great innovations there, and we continue to get traction with some of the innovations that we've had in our EMEA business. Julian Mitchell : And Dave, maybe just one follow-up on that. The pricing in transport, how do we think about that versus the Trane enterprise average of, I think, 10 points? Christopher Kuehn : Julian, I'll jump in. We don't really dial it in necessarily by each SBU. But I would say it's certainly contributing to the enterprise performance. The business operating system that's been deployed for many years. One aspect of that is pricing and getting in front of inflation. And the Thermo King team is really a part of that strength that we've shown over the last now 7 quarters in this highly inflationary environment and staying ahead on price cost. So really proud of where our teams both in Americas and Europe and in Asia dealt there. David Regnery : And Julian, if I could just follow up on just a quick story here to talk a little bit about our culture here at Trane Technologies. That team in the Americas overcame a massive obstacle that happened in the early May time period when a tornado hit our facility in Puerto Rico and really removed the roof from one of our major assembly operations there. And I can remember meeting with that leadership team and it was early May, and the President of that business, she walked into the room, and she looked at the team, and she had 3 questions for the team. And she said, number one, are all our employees safe? And the answer was, yes, because the storm hit on a Sunday afternoon and the plant was unoccupied. The second was, do any of our team members need help? And the answer was no because as tornadoes are, they tend to be very targeted, and it wasn't a large impact to the community. And the third question was, how do we get this facility back up and running so we could take care of our customers? And here we are talking about this in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter, and we were able to recover all of the missed revenue that happened in the second quarter and the third quarter. That team performed exceptionally well. And just it speaks volumes to the character of not only that team but to Trane Technologies. Julian Mitchell : That's good to hear, Dave. Maybe just switching tack for a second. Operating leverage, Chris, you called out 20% to 25% for Q4. When we look at just sort of broadly the next 12 months, do we assume that number lifts gradually as you get this kind of steady abatement of price cost and supply chain margin headwinds? There's no kind of step change, but it should clearly move higher from Q4. Christopher Kuehn : Yes, I would say, Julian, the commodity -- the direction where commodities are going would suggest there should be certainly some improvement. We've done some great work staying ahead on price and keeping them ahead of inflation. So I think that is an opportunity going into next year is that price versus direct material cost inflation. We are looking at areas such as wage inflation and energy inflation as well that have to be factored in. So we'll provide more guidance on that in a few months. . We're also going to be -- right now, we're in the middle of that planning process for next year. We're really spending a lot of time around our investments, again, and where can we accelerate some of those investments to really drive returns. So all of that's going to be baked in as we think about incrementals for next year. But a lot of moving components as always, but we'll give you guidance in a few months. Operator : We will take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Just going to -- maybe just starting off with maybe just parse out a little bit what's happening here on the margins. You're clearly -- I'm assuming FX, price costs having an impact. It's been down now for 4 quarters in a row. I'm just wondering, at what point do we start to see an improvement in the margin profile for the EMEA business? Christopher Kuehn : Yes, Joe, think of that FX decline on a year-over-year basis, about half of that is coming from foreign currency. The other half of that is still these acute supply chain issues that frankly, we saw in that region starting about a year ago with the significant demand. And we're still incurring higher costs to serve customers, which we know is the right thing to do in this market. But both those costs, the supply chain inefficiencies are just still very real. And then foreign currency are really the drivers for margin. . We do expect those margins to improve over time as these supply chain challenges improve. Dave's talked about this gradual recovery, and we've seen that occur in the third quarter with some stronger volumes than what we had forecasted. And we do see that gradually getting better as we move out over the next several quarters, but it's going to take some time. David Regnery : Yes, John, the other thing I would add is I'm very confident long term with our outlook in Europe. That region continues to grow share and it is one of our leading regions with innovation. So just a really creative management team there that's been able to execute well. And long term, I feel good about Europe. Joe Ritchie : Yes. I guess maybe part of my question, I should have asked it earlier, is like are you starting to see any impact from European energy costs? Like is that impacting the margin at all? Just any color around that would be helpful. Christopher Kuehn : Yes. I'd say maybe a little bit in the third quarter. I mean, certainly, as we talk to our employees, they're feeling the impact of that and their own utility bills and the statements that they're getting at home. Yes, so it's starting to creep in a little bit in the third quarter, a little bit into the fourth quarter and certainly into next year, maybe a bigger dollar amount for us to kind of consider and think about it from a pricing perspective. . I think what it's also doing is driving a fair amount of the order growth as well as you think about products that are in the Thermo King space, hybrid electric products that have 30% fuel savings versus the product that was on the market two years ago, the electrification of heating and driving our thermal management systems on the commercial HVAC side, the reduced energy intensity. Those are really contributing as well in this very challenging energy crisis in Europe. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just maybe sneak one more in just on resi. Can you parse out just what -- how much of the growth this quarter was price versus volumes? And whether there's been any like discernible difference between what you're selling through your own network versus what you're selling through independent distribution? David Regnery : Well, I think the simple answer there is everything was up mid-teens. So that makes it easy to answer. Yes, I mean, for the enterprise, we had over 10 points of price, and resi continues to be one of our leading businesses with price. So it's north of 10. But we won't go any further than that for competitive reasons, but it's a strong business, had a good strong third quarter. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Nice quarter, guys. I was -- just to follow-up on the last question on resi. I was wondering, are you seeing any signs of double ordering, pushback maybe as lead times come in, you're not getting -- you're getting cancellations or anything of that sort? I'm curious just you haven't given guidance for next year, but do you think resi profits can actually be up next year with volumes down some unquantified level? And if so, kind of why? David Regnery : Yes, I'll start. I'll let Chris talk about the profit next year, but we're not seeing any cancellations, okay? That's not happening. If I look at the inventory in the channel, as I said earlier, it's a bit higher than we would normally see, but nothing alarming, and we haven't seen any cancellations. I do believe that we will see our order rates on a unit basis continue to come down because we have to process through this backlog that is -- it's just -- we're still measuring it in months. And it's going to take several quarters before we're able to process that down. Christopher Kuehn : Yes. I would add on the margins. As we've said, the residential business has really had some very strong price over the last seven quarters. At the same time, stayed ahead of inflation. As we go into our planning process, we look at all of our strategic business units and we think about top line growth, leverage growth, our cash flow performance across the board. I think the team has executed quite well. With investments they've made over several years in the value space, that's a market that continues to grow well for that SBU and depending on how markets move in the U.S. that's an area that Ten years ago, we didn't have very much of a presence in the value channel. That's an area we do have a presence in today. And on the replacement side versus repair, we'll see where that plays out, but it's a business that has a great sense of purpose as well as brand. David Regnery : And I've said this before, but we don't see the residential business falling off a cliff next year. And we don't see margin contraction or large revenue falloffs. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : As your -- the mix of your resi business with furnaces, is that about in line with the industry, call it, like 30% or something like that? David Regnery : Yes, I don't -- I know that -- it's a good question, Steve. I don't have that in front of me. I would tell you that I know that our mix of heat pumps is stronger than the industry. So that would -- and obviously, you don't have a furnace with a heat pump, but I don't have the specifics on heat pumps when we're selling split systems. Steve Tusa : Yes. Okay. And then just on the commercial side, I think you guys put through a pretty dramatic price increase in the third quarter on light commercial, and we're continuing to hear about extended lead times there. Can you just talk about maybe if -- what kind of behavior you saw around that price increase or if I'm wrong about that? And then are you guys seeing longer than normal lead times on your -- on the light commercial side? Christopher Kuehn : Steve, I'll start with pricing. This part of our business operating system is to evaluate the input costs and then ultimately, making sure we're pricing based on value as well. So I'd say, across the majority of our businesses in 2022, we've seen actually three rounds of price increases, very similar to the three rounds we saw in 2021. So yes, I think the team is looking at significant demand, making sure we're pricing for it. A number of these products are being delivered three, six, nine months out, so we want to make sure we're protecting ourselves from an inflation perspective on the cost side. David Regnery : Yes. As far as lead times go, Steve, we have extended lead times across our portfolio as does the broader industry as do most industrials right now as we're still working through the supply chain challenges that are improving. As far as on the unitary side, actually, that's -- we're doing pretty well there. So I don't see that -- that's not an area that we have -- I would imagine that we're very competitive in the marketplace there. Steve Tusa : What was your commercial unitary order up in the quarter? That's my last question. David Regnery : Orders, I'm sorry, in unitary? Steve Tusa : Commercial unitary. Yes, commercial unitary equipment. Christopher Kuehn : I know our revenue was up in the 20s. I don't know what the order rate was. I can -- we'll get back to you on that after the call. . Operator : We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Just quickly on the unitary versus applied mix. Obviously, lots of questions about the macro. You applied large commercial feels like it's got a lot of secular tailwinds and it has. Is there -- would you say unitary still has a bit more cyclicality risk than applied? Just a quick question there. But really, my question is really around the services, low teens in the Americas and EMEA, really impressive. I think over time, it's grown 7%, 8%. Is the delta between trend and now mainly price? Or is this IAQ and other things that's driving that growth rate? And kind of like how do you think that trends in '23? David Regnery : Yes. I think if you look longer term at our service business, and let's look over a 5-year period here on a global basis, our service business is up on a compound annual growth rate, high single digits. So that's a business that's very resilient that's performed very well for us. In fact, in 2020, the pandemic year, we were flat to 2019 despite having lockdowns and having difficulty accessing some buildings. So service business is a great business. We have a great operating system around our service business. And today, it represents close to one third of Trane Technologies. So we're very happy with our service business. On the unitary side, we had strong growth in the -- throughout our commercial HVAC business. So it was broad-based in unitary and in applied. So really broad-based in many verticals across the globe. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great. And then my follow-on is really a quick one on supply chain. One of the companies this morning surprised on supply chain availability issues in the current quarter relative to last quarter. It feels like most companies are talking about supply chain slightly improving. I'm just wondering how you characterize the momentum and you're kind of in the half to get components? David Regnery : Yes, I'd say supply chain performed as expected during the third quarter. We anticipate a gradual improvement through the rest of the year and for several quarters into 2023. The team is -- our team is doing just a great job of managing that. I think this large backlog gives us more visibility as we talked about earlier, which, again, being able to tell our suppliers, what we need, okay, is very important and being accurate with that. And our team has just done a fantastic job there. So supply chain is improving slowly. Slower than any of us want, and we'll continue to see improvement in the fourth quarter here. . Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Jeff Sprague : Just a couple of loose ends. First, Chris, just back on Europe margins and FX. I typically think of FX, right, being a profit headwind but not a margin headwind. Is there some particular transactional issue going on in Europe beyond just kind of translation effect of dollar strength? Christopher Kuehn : Jeff, it's a good question. Not all the components, raw material purchases in Europe are all denominated in euros. There's certainly components that come in from the U.S. or from Asia. So there are some transactional headwinds here when you think about the declining euro against the dollar. So that's part of the driver. But I totally understand your question, but it is that dynamic of some of the components we buy in currencies other than the euro. Jeff Sprague : And I was wondering also if you guys could kind of take a swag at measuring kind of the productivity headwinds you've absorbed here over the last -- whether it's the year-to-date or since we got into this whole kind of tangled supply chain mess. And how significant have they been to margins in aggregate and just your thought process on being able to reverse some of that as we may perhaps get into the second half of '23? David Regnery : Yes. I think one of the knock-on effects of the supply chain that's inconsistent is productivity, right? So if you think about you're running a factory, and you don't have the right components, you're stopping lines, you're partially building product, you're putting it out in the yard, you're bringing it back on the line when you get the components to retest the product because, obviously, you want to test everything before it gets shipped out to a customer. So it's been disruptive. It's improving, but it's going to improve slowly as the supply chain improves. As far as quantifying it, it's difficult to do right now. I would just tell you that it's going to be slowly improving, and we'll continue to make progress. It's certainly a focus of our teams as to how do we get back to being able to have the productivity we've seen in the past. But the supply chain, the knock-on effect associated with it, it has had an impact in our operations for sure. Jeff Sprague : I'm sorry, just a related follow-up to that, Dave. So if supply chain got better more quickly than expected, do you think you can actually accelerate backlog conversion or the customer at the job site still is not ready, that there really isn't scope to dramatically accelerate backlog conversion? David Regnery : Yes. I think that we're obviously getting with extended lead times, okay? I think the first thing you're going to see as the supply chain improves, you'll see those lead times start to contract back to more of a normal level. But right now, we're obviously, especially on applied jobs, those are specific to a job site. And they're giving us enough lead way. So we're able to hit their expectations. So it's very difficult to accelerate that on the applied side unless the job site suddenly gets pulled forward, which happens, but I wouldn't say it's -- we're not seeing that as the norm right now. . Operator : We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital. Deane Dray : I'm not sure how specific you can get here. But at the outset of the call, you talked about market share gains in virtually all businesses. If we think about that 9 percentage points in volume growth, how much of that might be attributed to share? And again, it's harder at a total company level versus the business unit, but any color there would be helpful. David Regnery : Yes. I mean it is -- I think when you start talking averages and you start getting share to a company level, it's not meaningful. But I would tell you that if you look around the different regions, we like the growth rates we're seeing. We like the innovations we've been able to drive, and we certainly like the order rates that we're seeing and you could see that with our order rates versus maybe some other companies, but we're very happy with the performance. We're very happy with our product management teams being able to really understand customers' insights and being able to have innovations that exceed their expectations. So I expect that to continue in the future. One of the things that we pride ourselves in is the fact that we don't let up on innovation. We don't let up on the dollars that we invest in innovation, and we're going to -- you're going to continue to see that from Trane Technologies well into the future. Deane Dray : Appreciate that. And just as a follow-up. Any update on indoor air quality, healthy buildings initiative you all had kind of drawn the line in the sand and said it would be a 200 basis point lift for 10 years or so. Where does that stand? . David Regnery : Yes. Go ahead, Chris. Christopher Kuehn : Yes. We quantified it last year, Deane, as a 2-point lift on revenues. And then as we moved through the year last year, we just found it was really hard to start bifurcating what was an indoor air-quality order versus maybe a traditional equipment order or a service order. So certainly helped contribute to the growth last year. But as we're seeing significant growth this year, took the full year guide up 13% to 14% organic growth on the full year. Indoor air quality is one of those contributors to customers looking at upgrading their equipment, getting energy savings right earlier, especially where we see energy prices right now. It certainly is a contributor and remaining tailwind. David Regnery : Yes. One of the areas just talk a little bit about is in the education vertical. And I know the funding there with, our education vertical in North America order rates are up year-to-date over 40%, over 40%. So you could see the traction that we're having there. . Operator : We'll take our next question from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Joe O'Dea: I wanted to ask on COGS and just thinking about some of the cost dynamics moving forward. And if you could talk about sort of within the materials exposure, how much material is of COGS? How much of that is raws versus sourced components? And when you think about those cost trends? Or should we see drive supply chain and lower raws contribute to lower component costs as well or strong demand doesn't translate to lower component costs, just to kind of understand some of those moving pieces? Christopher Kuehn : Yes. It's certainly, I guess, all of the above in the mix. We'll -- we're going to look as we go into guidance for next year, trying to just give an update of the componentry of commodity costs versus other costs because that has kind of changed over time. We've described between copper, aluminum and steel, those being each about one third of total, what I call, Tier 1 commodity costs, excluding state refrigerants. And certainly, as I said before, it provides a bit of a tailwind going into next year in terms of where we see those commodity costs going right now. . Certainly, with more volume, there generally is a bit more leverage we can try to get. But in this supply chain environment and the constraints, we're ultimately just trying to manage that quarter-to-quarter and continue to see that getting better. So I guess I'd leave it at that kind of level as we kind of ultimately look to price for next year and ultimately try to get a price cost positive spread for next year. Joe O'Dea: Got it. That's helpful. And then back to the sort of price cost margin dynamic just based on the visibility that you have. When do you see that flipping such that you're positive on the margin side from a price cost angle? Christopher Kuehn : Yes. I expect for the fourth quarter to remain price cost positive on a dollar basis. I think it will still be margin decremental on a year-over-year basis. That price component, though, of the growth in the fourth quarter, that will be lower than the third quarter. We're just comping against stronger price realization from a year ago. Certainly second half of 2021 much stronger than the first half. So I do expect top line price to be less of a contributor in Q4. But we're on track to be price-cost positive for the full year. And ultimately, for the full year, it will be a bit of a margin headwind as well. . Operator : And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Zach Nagle for closing remarks. Zachary Nagle : Great. I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. And as always, we'll be around to take any questions that you might have in the coming days and weeks. And hopefully, we'll see you on the road soon. Everyone, have a great day. Bye. . Operator : And that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Zac, and everyone, for joining us on today's call. Let's turn to Slide 3. Before I dive in, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which is drives our differentiated financial results and long-term shareholder value. Our strategy is aligned to powerful megatrends, like climate change which has serious and far-reaching effects on the environment, the economy and human health. 2022 was again one of the warmest years on record, and we continue to see extreme weather events. Urgent action is needed to accelerate our transition to a low carbon green economy. That's where Trane Technologies is uniquely positioned to lead. Our innovation is transforming the industry and accelerating decarbonization of commercial buildings, homes and transport. We're helping our customers advance their own sustainability goals. While contributing to our gigaton challenge, a pledge to reduce customers emissions by 1 billion metric tons by 2030. Our purpose driven strategy, relentless innovation and strong customer focus enables us to deliver a superior growth profile, strong margins and powerful free cash flow. The end result is strong value creation across the board, for our team, our customers, our shareholders, and for the planet. Moving to slide 4, our global team delivered strong performance in 2022. As we compare our results to peers and the broader industrials, we're confident organic revenue and adjusted EPS growth will again rank in the top quartile for both the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our global teams have demonstrated resiliency and tenacity navigating persistent inflation, supply chain and a myriad of other macro related challenges globally. They've executed our business operating system which is designed for operational excellence, and delivered record results across virtually all key metrics. Throughout 2022, and building on extraordinary strength in 2021. We are continuing to see our relentless year in year out rain or shine, reinvestment and innovation paid dividends through unprecedented levels of customer demand. While this demand has been broad based, we're seeing particular strengths in our nonresidential businesses led by commercial HVAC, global commercial HVAC, organic bookings were up nearly 40% in 2022 on a two-year stack. Americas commercial HVAC bookings were up more than 40% on a two-year stack. The tremendous growth we've delivered over the past two years has driven absolute bookings to record levels. We continue to encourage investors to look at absolute bookings levels, in addition to growth rates to gain a more complete understanding of the strength of our businesses and our backlog. As an example, our commercial HVAC organic revenues were up more than 20% in the fourth quarter, while organic bookings were higher by about half that level up 11%. Still the book-to-bill was over 105% further adding to already record backlog. Likewise, while enterprise organic revenues were up 16% in the quarter, and organic bookings were flat total book-to-bill was still 100%. Customer demand, absolute bookings and absolute backlog have never been higher. We disclose absolute bookings and revenues each quarter by segment in our earnings release. 2022 bookings of $17.5 billion exceeded 2022 revenues by $1.5 billion for our book-to-bill 109%. Backlog entering 2023 is $7 billion well over 2x historical norms. Further, we expect backlog to remain elevated throughout 2023 and anticipate entering 2024 with backlog in excess of $6 billion. At our guidance midpoint revenue growth rate of 7%, 2023 revenues would be approximately $17.2 billion when compared to bookings of $17.5 billion in 2022, bookings would need to decline by over $1.1 billion in order for backlog to fall to the $6 billion number that I referenced heading into 2024. That would equate to a decline of about $275 million per quarter. For backlog to return to more normal levels of approximately $3 billion, bookings would need to decline by over $4 billion or more than $1 billion per quarter. While we recognize that we have difficult comps in 2023, we have a high degree of confidence that bookings will remain robust, and that we will enter 2024 with backlog of $6 billion or more. Turning to our guidance for 2023. We expect continued strong revenue growth, EPS growth and free cash flow. We have a proven strategy to outperform end markets and our business operating system enables us to deliver consistent strong execution despite challenging macro environments. We have a multiyear track record of delivering differentiated financial performance for shareholders and are well positioned to deliver strong shareholder returns over the long term. Please turn to slide number 5. As I discussed at the outset, I am proud of our global teams for delivering strong performance in 2022 despite persistent macro challenges, we significantly exceeded our revenue and EPS growth targets while delivering solid leverage and free cash flow and returning significant cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. While free cash flow was strong at 91% of adjusted net earnings for the year, we fell short of our target of 100% free cash flow conversion. We drove an exceptional volume of shipments in the month of December in our commercial HVAC and Thermo King businesses to meet customer demand, which shifted the timing of approximately $150 million in receivables into the first quarter 2023. We also invested about $40 million in safety stock inventory in the fourth quarter to ensure continuity of supply in this dynamic environment. Net of these two areas free cash flow would have been 100%. Please turn to slide number 6. One of the most important elements of our long-term strategy is fueling our high-performance Flywheel through relentless investments and innovation to solve our customers most complex problems. Leading customer innovation drives consistent and profitable market our growth, which in turn drives more cash to reinvest back into the business to further accelerate growth. This Flywheel as we refer to it is one of the key differentiators between Trane Technologies and our competition. We are unwavering in our commitment to invest heavily in our business, year after year, in good times and in bad. It's this ongoing focus that has enabled us to drive differentiated financial performance for shareholders over time. Over the past five years, including the pandemic in 2020, we delivered a 7% revenue compound annual growth rate, 250 basis points of margin expansion and free cash flow conversion well in excess of 100% and since 2017, we've deployed more than $13 billion in capital, with $8.3 billion return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Looking forward, you can expect us to continue to consistently reinvest in our business. And we'll talk later in the presentation about some of the ways in which we are accelerating investments in 2023, leveraging the strong outlook we see entering the year. Overall, we are exceptionally well positioned to continue our strong track record of performance and capital deployment over the long term. Please turn to slide number 7. As I discussed earlier in the presentation, customer demand for innovative products and services is at record levels, with particular strength in our nonresidential businesses, which comprise approximately 80% of our portfolio. Americas commercial HVAC was again a standout with low teens bookings growth and mid-teens revenue growth, including another quarter of high single digit services revenue growth. Bookings were up nearly 40% on a two-year stack, resulting in high absolute dollar bookings. And a book-to-bill ratio of over 110%, backlog continued to grow from an already high base and is now at levels that are 3x historical norms further adding to our visibility and confidence in our guidance for 2023. In residential, bookings continue to normalize, and we're down mid 20s in the quarter. The decline was expected against a very high prior year comp, as two year stock bookings were still up double digits. Residential revenues were up low single digits in the quarter and sell-through is up mid-single digits reflecting healthy end market demand. We continue to have historically high backlog in our residential business. And in the fourth quarter we work closely with our Independent Wholesale Distributors or IWDS to help them manage their inventory positions and mix as they entered 2023. Our goal was to mitigate the risk of stranded inventory across the channel. I'm pleased with the approach we took and the partnership with our channel. We believe our IWDS are in a good inventory position, entering 2023 as a result. Our America Thermo King business had another very strong quarter with 30% revenue growth. This follows growth of more than 60% in Q3. We've included our traditional transport refrigeration market overview slide near the back of the presentation, which shows the strong share gains for our Thermo King businesses globally in 2021 and 2022. Bookings were down modestly as expected, but still up more than 40% on a two-year stack. Backlog in this business remains at historically high levels, providing good visibility into future revenues. Overall, Americas backlog is unprecedented at 3x historical levels. Turning to EMEA, results in the quarter were also very strong. In our commercial HVAC business, we've highlighted acute supply chain challenges that have been impacting revenues and more importantly leveraged throughout 2022. We were able to overcome many of these challenges in the fourth quarter and delivered revenue growth in excess of 40% with strong leverage. Services growth was once again robust up double digits. Bookings were also robust up low teens with two-year stack bookings up more than 20%. We're seeing tremendous demand for Thermal management systems which are three to four times more efficient than conventional heating and cooling. Our transport refrigeration business in EMEA also delivers strong performance with low single digits organic revenue growth in the quarter in a market that was down double digits. We discussed the transport refrigeration business in detail on slide 16 of the presentation. Overall EMEA backlog remains elevated 40% higher than historical norms. Turning to Asia Pacific, the commercial HVAC team delivered another very strong quarter in Q4 with revenues up more than 20%. And services up mid-teens. Asia bookings were down as expected related to tough prior year comps and large bookings in the high-tech sector outside of China. Two-year stack bookings were still up high teens. China was resilient in the quarter with bookings up high single digits and revenue up double digits. Overall, Asia backlog remains elevated approximately 50% above historical norms. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Christopher Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number 8. This slide does a nice job encompassing our overall performance in the quarter, which was strong across the board. Organic revenues were up 16%, adjusted EBITDA margins were up 100 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 34% versus prior year. We delivered strong organic enterprise growth in both equipment and services of high teens and low teens respectively. Services growth was consistently strong throughout 2022. And our services mix is approximately 32% of enterprise revenues. Strong services mix bolsters the company's resiliency in virtually all market conditions. Please turn to slide number 9 to discuss the key revenue dynamics for the quarter. So I'll focus my comments on margins. We delivered strong margin expansion in each of our business segments. The key margin drivers are the same for each of our businesses. So we've consolidated the highlights on the right side of the page, robust volume growth, positive price realization, and modestly positive productivity more than offset persistent material and other inflation in the quarter. We also leverage strong margin expansion across the businesses to accelerate investments in innovation across a number of key initiatives. As mentioned previously, we are pleased with the significant progress we've made over the past two quarters, mitigating acute supply chain challenges in our EMEA businesses, which led to strong volume growth coupled with significant margin expansion in the quarter. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 10. As we discussed throughout the call, underlying demand for innovative products and services has never been higher, with historically high levels of bookings and backlog across our businesses. Relentless innovation, leading brands with strong market positions, customer focus and operational excellence are hallmarks of our market out growth over time. In the Americas, our commercial HVAC business is driving strong demand and share gains as demonstrated by our full year 2022 order growth that is more than 40% on a two-year stack. And we've exited the fourth quarter with elevated backlog that is 3x historical norms, providing us significant visibility into future revenues. The nonresidential markets remain strong and we are bullish on the outlook for commercial HVAC. Demand continues to be robust in datacenters, education, healthcare, and the high-tech industrial verticals, where we have strong customer relationships and market positions. Our commercial HVAC business is underpinned by long term secular tailwinds of energy efficiency, decarbonization and indoor environmental quality which are only growing stronger. We also see tailwinds from new and ongoing regulatory and policy related drivers such as the Inflation Reduction Act, Education, Stimulus, and the CHIPS and Science Act. Our commercial HVAC business is well positioned as the premier franchise to capitalize on the significant market opportunities that lie ahead. The residential market outlook remains dynamic. Near term we see the market continuing to normalize across bookings and revenue and the process is well underway. As we saw in the third and fourth quarters. For 2023, we believe this normalization process results in market units likely down in the mid-single digit range. With tailwinds from elevated backlog, pricing, supportive regulatory and policy initiatives and share gains, we believe our revenues will be relatively flat. Our guidance encompasses scenarios for residential in the plus or minus low single digits range. We don't see a cliff scenario and residential is about 20% of our business. So a 10% decline would present a 2% headwind to the enterprise. Longer term, we continue to see residential as a GDP plus business for us. Turning to Americas transport refrigeration, our diversified portfolio of products and aftermarket significantly outperform the end markets in 2021 and 2022. Act is calling for low single digit growth in trailer in 2023. And for weighted average transport refrigeration growth to be flattish. Consistent with our strong track record, we expect to outperform the end markets in 2023. Longer term, we continue to see transport refrigeration as a GDP plus, plus business. We'll talk more about the transport refrigeration outlook in our topics of interest section. Turning to EMEA, commercial HVAC, the market growth picture remains muted with macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges weighing. Given our innovative and leading sustainability solutions, we've been able to significantly outgrow the EMEA HVAC markets over a long period of time. We see continued opportunities for market out growth going forward, aided by thermal management systems, which are three to four times more efficient than traditional heating and cooling solutions and are gaining momentum in the market. Turning to EMEA transport refrigeration, the removal of the Russian market was a key driver of the market decline in 2022. Thermo King EMEA outgrew the end markets up high single digits for the year. As return to 2023, we expect the market to be down low single digits to mid-single digits, mainly related to economic uncertainty in the region. Our innovative products and solutions continue to provide us with strong platform to outgrow our end markets, which we expect to do again in 2023. Turning to Asia, the environment remains dynamic and COVID continues to add complexity and unpredictability to the market forecasts. We see continued strength in datacenter, electronics, pharmaceutical, and healthcare verticals. And if these markets continue to perform well, we could continue to see relatively stable growth in 2023. Asia continues to be one of the more dynamic markets. So we're cautiously optimistic on this segment, which represents about 10% of our portfolio. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris? Christopher Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number 11. Dave provided a good framework for how we're looking at our key end markets for 2023 and our guidance reflects these views. Embedded in our guidance is our philosophy around our value creation Flywheel, which builds in high levels of business reinvestment in innovation out growth across our end markets, and strong leverage. Regarding 2023, to 6% to 8%, organic revenue growth, and $8.20 to $8.50 in adjusted earnings per share, or approximately 11% to 15% EPS growth. Through the back half of last year, we talked about ending 2022 with $6 billion or more in backlog. And we're sitting at a record level of $7 billion as of the beginning of 2023. This gives us good visibility into 2023 revenues. We have approximately 1% of growth from M&A in 2023 from bolt-on acquisitions completed in 2022. And we expect FX to be neutral on a full year basis. We're targeting organic leverage of 25% plus for the year. There are a few key factors that play into our organic leverage target. So I'll spend a couple of minutes covering these factors to help frame the guidance. First, we're expecting modest incremental price and solid volumes to offset material and other inflation and drive strong incremental margins. Second, while we're expecting slow and steady improvement in a supply chain, as we've seen throughout 2022, we're not expecting it to be fully normalized until well into 2023 at the earliest. This will continue to put pressure on the realization of strong productivity, which is where our business operating system really thrives. Third, the environment around prices for Tier 1 metals remains dynamic. In the third quarter and early part of the fourth quarter last year, we saw a deflationary trend for base metal prices. However, pricing has increased over the last two months on copper, aluminum and steel, negating much of the potential deflationary benefit in 2023. To update you in a question from our earnings call last quarter, our Tier 1 spend on these metals is approximately $750 million split roughly a third each for copper, aluminum and steel. We are seeing modest deflation in freight and logistics costs. We're also seeing inflation from Tier 2 suppliers, as they incur higher than normal wage increases and energy costs. Net we're not baking in significant inflation or deflation into our guidance at this early stage in the year. Fourth, we're using the favorable environment we see in 2023 as an opportunity to double down on key investments across the business in advanced manufacturing and automation, digital and electrification platforms, among other key programs. We are targeting 20 to 30 basis points of incremental spend across these areas, which will be embedded in a segment P&L. This is above and beyond our average incremental spend of approximately 40 basis points per year. So we're targeting 60 to 70 basis points of incremental spend in total. We've highlighted that business reinvestment is how we win over the long term. And we're confident we can make these investments in 2023 while hitting our guidance range. We have additional investments earmarked in our corporate and CapEx guidance as well. Lastly, while our M&A transactions I referenced earlier will have a strong payout over the next several years, they will add about 1% to our revenue at approximately 3% leverage in the first year, inclusive of integration costs. The net effect cuts about two percentage points off of our enterprise reported leverage versus our organic leverage that excludes M&A. It's not a huge amount, but it's something we wanted to highlight as a factor to consider in our guidance, as organic leverage will be stronger than reported leverage simply on the math related to M&A. We'll highlight organic leverage each quarter to provide transparency. Turning to cash, we expect 2023 to be a strong cash collection year, we have about $150 million in receivables that shifted from December into early Q1. And barring persistent supply chain issues all year, which we do not anticipate, we expect to bring working capital levels down specifically around inventory. Net free cash flow conversion should be 100% or better. Please go to slide number 12. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation, including an incremental $60 million in 2023. We continue to invest these cost savings into high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio. And I discussed a number of targeted investments for 2023. To be clear, our continuous improvement mindset is an integral part of our business operating system and continues well beyond the transformation program that we started in 2020 when we launched Trane technologies, our business operating system is designed to drive gross productivity each year to offset other inflation. While it's been impossible to realize that level of gross productivity over the past three years, given the tumultuous macroeconomic backdrop, productivity has been improving as supply chain slowly recover and is contributing to our 25% plus organic leverage target in 2023. Please go to slide number 13. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy focused on consistently deploying excess cash opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to slide number 14. And I'll provide an update on our capital deployment in 2022 and our outlook for 2023. In 2022, we executed strong and balanced capital allocation of $2.1 billion, including approximately $1.2 billion to share repurchases, $620 million to dividends, and approximately $250 million to M&A. We are targeting $2.5 billion in capital deployment in 2023, and expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our M&A pipeline remains active and we continue to exercise discipline in our approach. Our shares remain attractive trading below our calculated intrinsic value, and we have approximately $3.2 billion remaining under current share repurchase authorizations. Our strong free cash, flow liquidity and balance sheet, continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality and dry powder moving forward. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 16, our Thermo King businesses have significantly outperform their end markets in both 2021 and 2022 as illustrated on the table on the right-hand side of the page. In 2022, the North America transport refrigeration markets were up 12% while Thermo King Americas was up more than 20% The EMEA transport refrigeration markets were down 9% in 2022 while Thermo King EMEA was up high single digits. We are very pleased with the share gains we've achieved over the past two years. In 2023, we expect the markets to be flat to modestly down and for Thermo King to once again outperform consistent with our strong track record. We also added additional information to the slide this quarter to help investors and analysts gain a better understanding of the size of the businesses. We've included a footnote that global Thermo King has approximately 50% of our enterprise revenue and the split between the Thermo King segments is roughly 60%, Americas 35%, EMEA and 5% Asia. Please turn to slide number 17, Act has updated their long term forecast for refrigerated trailers through 2027. The data supports the view we've been highlighting for some time. Now that this is a mid-40,000-unit market plus or minus about 10%. The chart plots the actual and forecast but the key takeaways is that the market is expected to be flat at 45,000 units in 2023. Dip to 40,000 units in 2024 rebound back to 45,000 units in 2025. And to continue growing low single digits from that point forward to 2027. Additionally, our transport refrigeration businesses are a diversified portfolio with a healthy aftermarket business. We have strong positions in large and small trucks, APUS, bus, air, and rail and a proven track record to outperform the transport refrigeration markets. We believe this is a GDP plus, plus business for us over the long term. Please go to slide number 18. In summary, we are positioned to outperform consistently, energy efficiency, decarbonization and sustainability mega trends continue to intensify, driving increased demand for innovative products and services. We are delivering leading technologies and innovation to address these trends and accelerate the world's progress underpinned by our engaging uplifting culture. The strength of our business operating system, the power of our global team, unprecedented backlog and continued high levels of customer demand, give us confidence in our full year revenue and EPS guidance. We believe we have the right strategy, the best team and a solid foundation in place to deliver strong performance in 2023 and differentiated shareholder returns over the long term. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Good morning, and maybe just the first question around any thoughts on sort of the cadence of the organic sales trend? The 7% through the year, any sort of particularly waiting early versus late in the year, and also that 25% plus core leverage goal for the year? Again, is that -- is there anything in kind of price cost or the investment spend waiting that skews that first half versus second half at all? Christopher Kuehn : Hey, good morning, Julian. This is Chris, I'll start and then Dave may jump in. But as we think about the cadence throughout 2023, let me start with the first quarter. Q1 is typically around 11% to 12% of our full year earnings. Right now, we would project Q1 to be a bit stronger than that than our historical average, it's probably in the 15% to 16% range of full year earnings. And we see that around, really between $1.30 and $1.35 in adjusted EPS, I think the revenue growth in terms of the first quarter, it's roughly in line with how we see kind of a full year at this point. And we see leverage being really 25% plus, really throughout the year, it\u2019s roughly balanced. The investment spends, it really is going to be ratable throughout the year. We started, we've been many years, of course with investments and leading in innovation. But I see that spin really being roughly equal throughout the year. Anything you want to add? David Regnery : I just think, hi, Julian, how you doing? First of all, Chris talked a little bit about our leverage of 25 plus, could there be a quarter where that's higher? Sure, absolutely. Based on where we see opportunities, but I would tell you, from my vantage point, we love to reinvest in our business, we love to find opportunities to drive differentiated revenue growth on the top line, the Flywheel that I referred to in my opening comments. It's something that has a proven track record for us and as an innovation leader in the industry, we plan on that continuing well into the future. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. Thank you. And if we're looking at the sort of markets of residential and then transport on a global basis, are we assuming that the resi weakness is more sort of first half? And the transport weakness more pronounced in the second half? Is that the right way to think about those two pieces? David Regnery : I mean, let's start with residential. I think we're pretty clear in our comments there, we think residential for the full year will be down to mid-single digit range. We think that based on some of the tailwinds that we have in our own business being strong backlog, strong price. We'll see some tailwinds probably later in the year, with some regulatory changes, specifically around IRA, we see that as we will be plus or minus 1%, and residential. On Thermo King, if you look at the Americas, and you look at x specific data, right now, they have that as a stronger first half for second half. But that assumes Julian that the trailer OEMs will actually be able to hit the production rates. We haven't seen them demonstrate that. So my belief is that some of that volume will actually push towards the second half from the first half, but we'll see how the year plays out. As far as in Europe, Thermo King we think the market will be down a lot of that's the economic conditions there. But in both cases, whether the Americas or in Europe, we plan on outperforming the markets as we've demonstrated our capability over the last two years. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Good morning. Thanks, guys. Thank you. Hey, I just wanted to ask you about any, are you seeing any evidence of weakness in the forward project pipeline on the commercial HVAC in that domain? David Regnery : I'm sorry just repeat \u2013 Gautam Khanna : I'm just curious like. David Regnery : I am sorry, go ahead. Gautam Khanna : Yes, any weakness forward \u2013 David Regnery : Yes, I got this in the foreword. Yes, no, we're actually, if you look at our commercial HVAC businesses on a global basis, right, lots of strength in the Americas, really, across many verticals, okay, which is always a good sign. We don't see that slowing down. In fact, we see some tailwinds towards the back half of the year with regulatory changes as far as IRA, as well as with the CHIPS Act. Okay, that's all-in front of us. So those will be nice tailwinds. With a book-to-bill of 110%. We have a lot of backlogs in our commercial HVAC, Americas business. In Europe. just to be really blunt about it, we're winning in Europe with our innovations. And just a really strong fourth quarter, we had been faced with some supply chain issues there throughout 2022. A lot of those challenges improved dramatically in the fourth quarter. You see that with our revenue growth, I mean, revenue growth in the fourth quarter was up - was over 40%. And our bookings continued to be strong as they were up in the high teens, so a lot of strength there. And then in Asia, I mean, Asia was a surprise. And our revenue growth was 20%. About five points of that was kind of a hangover from the COVID problems we had in the second quarter, but still 15% very strong, and order rates remain strong. In China, specifically, our order rates were up close to double digits, revenue was up double digits. So we're cautiously optimistic on Asia as it reopens China then. Gautam Khanna : Thanks for the thorough answer. And then just lastly, could you quantify how much price you have embedded in the sales guidance this year? Christopher Kuehn : Hey, Gautam, this is Chris. Yes, I think we have modest price carryover going into 2023. Certainly we're going to be comping against tough comps in 2022 with record levels of pricing. You think about the full year \u201822, we had close to 10 points of price. It's actually 9.5 points of price on the full year. Right now we're not planning on multiple price increases in 2023. But we do remain nimble to react to how we see input costs playing out during the year. It's a strength in our business operating system we've remained price costs positive. These last two years of highly inflationary environments. So we're going to remain nimble. Could it be in the 2% to 2.5% range? Yes, that's probably the range that it's in for carryover. Operator : Our next question comes from Joshua Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning. I guess just wondering if you can give us any detail on how you're thinking about some of the stimulus items? I think you mentioned, there's probably more of a second half phenomenon. So maybe more of a \u201824 story, but what do you think that can be worth in terms of growth? Is \u201823 really just a bookings year? And when you think about Dave that sensitivity you gave on the backlog conversion versus maybe the cushion you have on the orders front? would IRA be a potential kind of further source of cushion that you think about in that? David Regnery : Okay, nice question, Josh. I think that first I'll start with what we're seeing right now in stimulus, we're seeing a lot of demand, obviously, within the education vertical. If you're looking at our education vertical in the Americas, the equipment business, in 2022, it's up close to 40%. Okay, and that's going to continue for some time now. I believe the change in that was, if an order booked, I think it\u2019s September 2024, you actually have until 2026, to have it installed. So we see that continuing to happen. And you see that in our very, very strong absolute booking dollars that we're able to generate. IRA, obviously that's still being worked through the funds are going to flow from the Fed to the states, and then the states will operate in a framework, and we'll work with the different states to make sure that we're very clear on how that's going to happen. We see that as it's certainly in the back half of the year, both in the commercial space, as well as in the residential space. The key to being successful, really, with IRA is, how do you take something that's pretty complex right now and make it really simple for the customer? And that's exactly what we did with the education funding that was available. And we'll do the same. We're really good at that with the IRA. As far as the CHIPS Act go, yes, that's going to be back half. I mean, we, that's all-in front of us. And it's certainly going to be an opportunity, we have a lot of strength in that vertical, we had great customer relationships. But some of that bookings could happen in 2023. But that's really all in front of us. I think the applications are just being opened up here in the first quarter so that they can start applying for these funds. So that's really all in front of us, given the duration time it takes to actually get a bad plan from planning up to operations. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Snyder with UBS. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I just wanted to start by following up on the prior commentary around some of the IRA benefits potentially coming through in the back half of the year. I mean, how do you feel about capacity and available supply to meet the expected pickup in heat pump demand into the back half? David Regnery : Yes, it's a good question. I think I'll start with the supply chain. I think the supply chain continues to improve gradually. The fourth quarter was better than the third quarter, I'm sure in the first quarter, we've done in the fourth quarter. But we see that is a several quarters before the supply chain gets back to what I would call normal. As far as capacity is concerned, we don't have capacity concerns. As a company that embeds lean thinking in our operating system, we're constantly looking to, for ways to expand our capacity with our own four walls. So we're very comfortable, we'll be able to meet the demand. That will happen and hopefully it starts to happen in the fourth quarter. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Appreciate that. And for the follow up I wanted to ask on transport bookings, specifically in the Americas, which seem to drive a good chunk of the sequential slowdown. As we look forward, should we expect bookings there to pick up as the back half 2023 order bookings opened up. Thank you. Christopher Kuehn : Hey, Chris, this is Chris, I'll start with that answer. We've been selective with opening up the backlog in our Thermo King businesses now for the last couple of years. And what it means is we haven't opened up the second half of 2023 orders at this time. We are talking with customers; we are getting strong insights from them on what units they need. We're just not pricing that at this point at the end of the fourth quarter, and therefore it's not making its way into bookings and or into backlog so. For the Americas business, we're seeing that transport markets being slightly favorable. The trailer market being one to two points up on a year-over-year basis so very solid. Dave commented about the cadence throughout the year that may shift a little bit more into the second half, depending on how the OEMs get through their fleets and get their output up. But I will tell you that really strong business, we have a lot of innovation in that business, it is a diversified business as well. And so while we've been able to outgrow the markets for the last several years, we have those plans to do it again in 2023. David Regnery : Yes, Chris, the only thing I would add is if you look at the Thermo King Americas business on two-year stack, order rates are up over 40% and a very large backlog going into 2023. So it's a business that has performed extremely well, in 2022, and will continue to outperform the markets in 2023. Operator : We'll take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joe Ritchie : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Doing great. Thanks. Dave, I really liked the way you teed up the backlog discussion earlier today. There's been a lot of focus on order rates decelerating. And it seems like the trends in your business, particularly on the commercial HVAC side remain really strong. I know it's probably too early, but as you kind of think about what's occurring today from the stimulus perspective, nonroad construction, supply chain still a bit of an issue. I mean shouldn\u2019t your backlog exit the year, like well above normal levels as you kind of think about the growth rate even just beyond 2023. David Regnery : Yes, I think you're spot on, Joe, I think a normal backlog for our business at the end of any years, probably in the $3 billion range. And we'll end 2023 and enter 2024 with a backlog that could be $6 billion or greater. And we do -- we believe our backlog will be elevated for a long period of time, which gives us a lot of visibility not only to future revenues, but also allows us to help our suppliers and to make sure they have plenty of visibility as to what our requirements are going to be. Joe Ritchie : That's great to hear. And I guess maybe my one follow-up is really to some commercial HVAC in EMEA, that was really strong this quarter, much stronger than we anticipated. Can you maybe just provide a little bit more color? What you're seeing there specifically, is that heat pump demand? Like, what drove that growth rate this quarter? David Regnery : Yes, it's a great question. And I'd say I'm so proud of our team in commercial HVAC EMEA, yes, we had 40% plus revenue growth in the quarter, we had some supply chain issues earlier in the year that we highlighted. Okay, a lot of those, so many of those got rectified in the fourth quarter. So that helped us get the volume out. But I look at the order rates as well. And the order rates are up mid-teens, two-year stack up 20. We are seeing tremendous demand for our thermal management systems. So our growth rates in Europe are really a function of our innovation that we've been able to deliver to the marketplace. And we are winning share in Europe, and we are winning with our customers. So it's a really great story with our business in EMEA. I've been with that business for a long time. And I was in the days when it was not such a great business. But it is very, very strong today. We have such a great leadership team there that's constantly pushing the envelope on innovation, so expect more in the future. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning. Good. Can you just provide a little bit of color on the difference in Americas between unitary and applied just on the revenue side? And then maybe orders as well? David Regnery : Sure, let me put my glasses on here so I can see. We were strong, really on an equivalent basis. The Americas was strong, really in both. I mean, our unitary revenue was up was north of 30%. Steve, and our, the Applied Business in the Americas was mid-teens. So both very, very strong. Our bookings -- go ahead. Steve Tusa : Yes. And then sorry, go ahead, bookings. Sorry about that. David Regnery : Yes, bookings were high single digits in unitary and around 34 applied very strong result. Steve Tusa : Got it. And then how do you kind of see just the high-level profile of these businesses? You said the revenue growth is going to be pretty consistent in throughout the quarter from a cadence perspective? How do you see the businesses, each of those businesses performing just at the high level of commercial HVAC, TK and resi, relative to the annual guidance? Christopher Kuehn : Steve, as we think about commercial businesses, I'll speak for Americas and EMEA really just our plans right now up high single digits in terms of revenue on the full year, the significant backlog just gives us really strong visibility to the revenue profile. And then Dave talked about the stacking effect from a bookings perspective. Could we see 10% growth in some of these businesses and pockets? Possibly, it really depends on the maturity of the supply chain, which we've seen gradually get better over the last several quarters, and we've got embedded in the guide, a gradual improvement in 2023. But if it got stronger, could that output be stronger on the top line? Yes, it could be. But let's see how the year kind of plays out. I think for Asia, we're calling it dynamic. We're calling right now for stable growth as you work throughout the year, but it\u2019s a dynamic market, and we're watching it closely, but very strong backlog entering into the year. Steve Tusa : Sorry, I mean for first quarter, I don't know if that's who you're talking about just the first quarter high level on the three businesses. Christopher Kuehn : Yes, I would say first quarter overall, [inaudible] enterprise, like I mentioned earlier, I see the revenue growth in Q1 in line with how we see the full year. That 68% kind of range, commercial HVAC, I would expect to be stronger as we work throughout the year, just given the profile, we've got some backlog, but certainly carrying into the first quarter. We'll open up the bookings here for the second half shortly. But I would expect that to be at the enterprise level and that 68% range, and we'll see how that plays out. Operator : We will take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, guys. Good, how are you? So Dave and Chris, I know you mentioned not too much carryover pricing in 2003. And that you might not get as much deflationary benefit as you first thought given the rise in -- recent rise in commodity prices. But I think just in the last couple of weeks, you've continued to raise prices, commercial HVAC call it mid to high single digits and up to 10% on resi HVAC. So are the recent price increases, really, because commodities such as copper have been rising in lately or should we read into the fact that demand is still quite good for Trane and so the ability to raise price is still there in \u201923. Christopher Kuehn : Hey, Andy, it's really a mix of all the above, we are trying to get within the lock, just one price increases, we start the year that's been our cadence prior to the last two years of this highly inflationary environment. So we're trying to set the stage for where we see pricing for the year inclusive how of how we see these commodity costs playing out over the last couple of months. And the goal is we don't have three rounds of price increases as we work through 2023. So right now, it's really baking in all of that information today with that price increase entering 2023. David Regnery : And just add to that, obviously, we are seeing, Chris talked about materials, but labor is certainly inflationary as energy costs. So if you look at all the cost inputs, which are product growth teams look at in a lot of detail. It allows them to have visibility as to what to see in the future. Andy Kaplowitz : Got it, that's helpful guys. And then you talked about Thermo King\u2019s increasing ability to out performs end markets, it seems like as you talked about, you're suggesting Thermo King to grow again in \u201823, despite the primary markets being flat to down but did it secular tailwinds that we all know about such as the electrification and that's going on in Thermo King raise the probability that it just becomes less cyclical. So as you go into a year like \u201824 where ACT is talking about its forecast is down a little bit that you could still not be that cyclical or even go up in 2014. David Regnery : Yes. I mean, the cyclicality we could arm wrestle over. Okay, if you look at the trailer market in the Americas, it's been in that 40,000-unit range for a long time plus or minus 10%. So very strong market. As far as the electrification, we'll wait and see on that. I would tell you that we are, that's one of the investments that we're really doubling down on, is how do we expedite what we're doing there on electrification, we are seeing demand from our customers, especially in the shorter distances. So think of the truck aspect there. So our team is doing a great job meeting their expectations, but more to come we're, I'm very excited about the innovation pipeline specifically in our Thermo King business. Operator : We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So I think I came on bit late, but I think you mentioned backlog moving down from $7 billion to $6 billion, still a very healthy level. I'm guessing most of that would be in commercial HVAC. But I'm just wondering how much TK would come into that backlog conversion as well. But my real question here is what is the key gating factor to an even stronger backlog conversion? I am thinking your supply chain, construction, labor, skilled labor in the field. Versus maybe customers don't want the equivalent today? I'm guessing they do. But what is the gating factor to getting even more backlog converted? David Regnery : I think you got the answer, Nigel, there's a couple of things, right? First of all, the backlog of $6 billion, I was kind of using that as an example. I think we're going to end 2023 with a backlog of $6 billion or more. Okay, so there's, for us to burn $1 billion in backlog will be a lot. As far as why can't you burn it faster? A couple of reasons you hit on, right. One is supply chain, it's improving, it will continue to improve in the future, our teams are doing just a fantastic job working with our suppliers, giving them visibility and everything we can to make sure that we improve their performance. And that's happening. The second is that lead times, especially in our commercial HVAC businesses, and the applied side of it, for sure, have extended. And that's not unique to Trane Technologies that's really across the industry, in fact, we're very competitive with our lead times. But so that means that customers don't want an order early, right, you're not going to ship an order, especially on the applied side to a customer before their job site is ready. And so that's elongating the backlog as well. Nigel Coe : Okay. I was kind of hoping you might delineate between, okay, labor is a real problem, supply chain getting better, but it's okay. And then on the 25%, or better incremental margins for this year. I mean, that's pretty impressive when you think about commercial HVAC are growing residential and TK. And we've all been trained to believe that resi, TK better margin commercial talks about businesses low margin, is that the wrong thesis? Or are you absorbing mixed headwinds within that 25% plus? Christopher Kuehn : Nigel, it's Chris. So we're aware of that thesis. And I think, with our focus on our business operating system, we're ensuring all of our businesses are growing margins. I would say in the commercial HVAC businesses really been impacted the last couple of years of the supply chain challenges, lots of inefficiencies, the inability to drive productivity, lots of increased costs to serve customers and expediting freight, buying components on the spot markets, we've incurred a lot of costs in the business just to get the revenue out. And that's presenting a nice opportunity, as the supply chain normalizes as we can drive productivity in the plants, and ultimately, get our team members focused on both productivity and solving the supply chain issues, which they're doing outstanding jobs, solving the supply chain issues throughout the last two years. But I see all of our segments next year having very strong leverage. And I think that some really nice opportunities there for us to go drive. And when we eliminate some of those inefficiencies. We're also baking in incremental investments. So I think we can do both next year. We can drive 25% or better organic leverage with also incrementally under 20 to 30 basis points of investments, allows us to do both and really drive for market outgrowth. David Regnery : Nigel, just to follow up on the labor concern. That's not a concern for Trane Technologies. We've done a great job being able to track the right labor, we're doing a great job. Our human resource department is doing just a fantastic job of training, creating career ladders for hourly associates, so we really want to be that destination location, not only for our salaried employees, but also our hourly employees and we're doing a great job there. Christopher Kuehn : Maybe I'll add one more thing is just our Asia business, right as majority call it 90 plus percent commercial HVAC, and it's driving high teens EBITDA margin. So I think it shows that we can really drive there for our businesses globally. Operator : We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Doing really well, thank you. There's a lot of discussion on backlog here just struck me is what happens on past due like, do you have to set realistic expectations with the customers on when they'll actually get deliveries? David Regnery : Yes, that is exactly why there's elongated lead times right now. You do not want to disappoint a customer with delivery. Think about it. I mean, some of our products will use air handling as an example, if you're constructing a building, okay, you could end up holding up an entire job if you're late. And trust me, you don't want to be on the other end of a phone call that has the whole building being slowed up because of your product. So we're making sure that we're providing realistic lead times to our customers, doesn't mean we don't have our past dues, we do, we track that very intensely, our plant managers drive that on a daily basis. But for the most part, you really have to give realistic dates as to when a customer can expect the product and you need to hit it. And that's one of the key operational metrics that we look at it at a high level. And I could tell you, it happens at a very detailed level within our business. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. And as a follow up, I was really interested in your comment, just saying you're trying to avoid situations with stranded inventory. How does that happen? And any comment on the whole new CA rollout? David Regnery : Yes, it really it was associated, the comment was associated with the CA roll on. Christopher Kuehn : And I think that there's a little bit more complexity this time, we're depending on where you're located in the country. It's an installed date for some manufacturing date. So we really worked with our independent wholesale distributors in the south, okay, because that's really where the, for non-heat pump product where that was installed date, so we don't want them to get stranded. So we help manage that situation. And we're pretty good at this. I mean, we implement so many new products that phase in phase out as we refer to it, it is the second nature to us. So we just really helped our IWDS work through that process. Operator : We will take our next question from Brett Linzey with Mizuho. Brett Linzey : Hi, good morning, all. Hey, I just want to come back to the transport business, you guys have been outperforming there for quite some time. Looks like \u201923 you got a lot of innovative solutions, new products coming to the market. I was hoping you could just put a finer point on the outgrowth expectation there. And then specifically on some of these new product launches, are you simply cannibalizing older equipment technology? Or are you actually increasing the total addressable market with some of these electrification offerings? David Regnery : A bit of both on that. I think that you obviously are going to cannibalize any combustion engine that's out there with your electric solution. But there's also opportunities, you think about, I guess, like best example, that would probably be think of home delivery, right? That's it's a realm. I mean, it's a relatively new market. Okay. It's expanding quite quickly. I think with some of our new electrified product, that higher capacity, you're going to be able to create different market opportunities. And I won't be more specific than that. But we're pretty excited about what we see there. And your other question was just \u2013 Brett Linzey : Just on the total outgrowth expectation for the year. David Regnery : Yes, I won't get too specific on that. But I think you could see that we've obviously taken share for the last couple of years, and we anticipate taking more share in the future, right. I mean, our team just does a great job there with working with our dealers, creating value propositions for our customer that are very compelling. I mean, I use Europe as an example. I mean, if you have a product that's able to get 30% better efficiency than the best in the market, I mean, you're going to have a very compelling opportunity to talk to every customer about the value proposition that we bring. And that's what we do. And we see these innovations and Thermo King use innovations in residential, these innovations in commercial really hitting the mark with our customers. And it really allows us to create that differentiated revenue growth that we're seeing on the top line. It's that Flywheel that I referred to, and we're going to continue to make sure that we save plenty of dollars to reinvest in our business to keep that Flywheel very vibrant. Brett Linzey : Yes, makes sense. Thanks. And just one follow up regarding the incremental investment. Could you just spend a little more time on those priorities. I think you said factory automation, anything on paybacks or what do you think the structural benefits might be there? Christopher Kuehn : Yes, I'll start, Brett. So generally what I'd look at is focused on our factory of the future and automation. We're spending time and cost around digital and also around electrification that Dave spoke to, specifically. And not only that Thermo King portfolio, but also in our commercial HVAC portfolios as you think about electrification and heating. So they're great investments to make. Some of them are driving revenues and backlogs immediately. On the automation side, the factory side. This is the opportunity for us as we see the productivity coming back into the business and allows the features for us to go drive more their productivity when you can drive some more automation, get more volume through the factories, and it's been an investment we've been working on for several years. And it's also going to be a little bit of an increased investment in 2023. But very strong paybacks. And look, I think it helps contribute over the long term to that target we have in incremental as a 25%, or better. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Hey, guys, thanks a lot for fitting me in. Hey, good morning. Just a question very interesting discussion about the fact that the industry is changing. So do you think that these extended lead times and much more visibility in the cycle is becoming more of a permanent feature of the industry? Because it seems you and others are training the customers to live with the lead times? And maybe you've given them some flexibility in terms of deliveries? But it seems that perhaps it's the future of the industry that's here to stay? I was wondering if we could push that discussion further. Thank you. David Regnery : Yes. I mean it's a provocative question, Andrew. And I don't see it that way. I think that as supply chain improves, you'll see lead times contract, does it go back to what it was post pandemic? Maybe not, maybe it's a little bit longer. I think that everyone sees the value in the visibility. And we've done a lot of work with our customers setting up some of those more visibility in that space so that will stay. So could they extend a bit? Sure. I don't expect, I expect them to improve from where they are today. And if I went back a year, I would tell you, they've dramatically improved from a year ago. So we'll see how it plays out. But it's a very provocative question. Andrew Obin : Thank you. And just a follow up. Can you just, the safety stock investment? What specific area is that related to? Thank you? David Regnery : Yes, I mean, I'll be very specific. It was, very nervous about what's coming out of Asia. And so we want to put additional safety stock for anything that's coming out of Asia. And we think it's very prudent. It's about the $40 million range and the reopening there of China specifically, although we're cautiously optimistic. We just want to make sure that we were reading the tea leaves correctly, and that we did not get caught short of supply. Operator : And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Zack Nagel for any additional or closing remarks. Zachary Nagle : Thanks operator. I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. And as always, Pat and I will be available, along with Susan to take any questions that you may have in the coming days and weeks. We look forward to speaking with you then. And also, we're going to be on the road quite a bit here at conferences in February and into March. And we look forward to seeing you on the road soon. Thanks and be safe. Operator : And that concludes today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies' first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We're also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Zach, and everyone, for joining us on today's call. I want to begin with a few thoughts on our purpose-driven strategy, which enables us to drive differentiated financial results and shareholder returns over the long term. Our strategy is aligned to powerful megatrends like climate change, which continues to have serious and far-reaching effects on the environment, the economy and human health. Urgent action is needed to limit global warming and preserve our planet for next generations. That's where Trane Technologies is uniquely positioned to lead. We just released our latest ESG report, which highlights how our innovation is helping our customers decarbonize their operations, save energy and improve performance. We have reduced our customers' carbon emissions by 93 million metric tons since 2019 towards our goal of reducing emissions by 1 gigaton or 1 billion metric tons by 2030. These bold ambitions drive our relentless focus on innovation, and our innovation creates tremendous demand for our sustainable solutions. This enables us to deliver a superior growth profile, strong margins and powerful free cash flow. The end result is long-term value creation across the board for our team, our customers, our shareholders and for the planet. Moving to Slide number 4. Our global team continues to execute at a high level and delivered another quarter of strong performance. showcasing the power of our diverse, resilient portfolio. Organic revenue was up 9%. Adjusted operating margins expanded 140 basis points, and adjusted EPS grew 26%. Absolute bookings levels continue to be extremely strong, as evidenced by our book-to-bill ratio of 117% in the first quarter. We added $400 million to our backlog, driving record backlog of $6.9 billion at year-end 2022, up to $7.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. Demand continues to be particularly strong in our long-cycle commercial HVAC businesses, where global commercial HVAC bookings were up more than 35% on a 2-year stack. And Americas commercial HVAC bookings were up nearly 40% on a 2-year stack. We've been encouraging investors to look at absolute booking levels and backlog in addition to growth rates to gain a more complete understanding of the strength of our business. Q1 is a good example of why that is important. Our enterprise book-to-bill of 117% was led by commercial HVAC in all regions and demonstrates ongoing exceptional levels of demand for innovative products and services and continued backlog build. These strong results position us well for continued profitable growth in 2023 and 2024 with improving visibility. Our backlog of $7.3 billion is more than 2.5 times historical norms. Further, we expect backlog to remain elevated throughout 2023 and anticipate entering 2024 with backlog in excess of $6 billion. To be clear, $6 billion in backlog is a scenario we believe represents the floor. The intent is to accomplish two goals : first, give investors a high degree of confidence we will meet or exceed the floor scenario. The second is to give investors a high degree of confidence that the floor scenario will put us in a very strong position entering 2024 with backlog as a percentage of forward revenues significantly higher than historical norms. Our strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial position continue to provide us with excellent capital allocation optionality. Year-to-date, we've deployed $720 million to dividends, share repurchases and M&A, and we expect to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in 2023. On the M&A front, we acquired a leading industrial process cooling technology company in EMEA and committed to acquire a precision temperature control cooling company in the life science vertical in the Americas. Overall, the first quarter played out essentially as expected and gives us confidence in raising our full year guidance for revenue and EPS growth. We continue to expect free cash flow to be equal to or better than 100% of adjusted net earnings. Chris will discuss our guidance in more detail later in the presentation. Please go to Slide number 5. Demand for our innovative products and services continue to be broad-based across our segments, highlighting the strength of our global portfolio. Our book-to-bill in the quarter was not only strong at the enterprise level but exceeded 115% in each segment as well, contributing to elevated backlog across the portfolio. Revenue is also robust in each segment with particular strength across our commercial HVAC businesses. In the Americas, our book-to-bill ratio exceeded 115%, led by commercial HVAC. The commercial HVAC team delivered standout results with strong absolute booking that exceeded mid-teens revenue growth. Revenue growth was strong in both equipment and services, up high teens and low teens, respectively. Our Americas residential business performed largely in line with our expectations at this early stage in the year. Bookings and revenue continue to normalize as we approach the cooling season and distributors manage their inventory positions. Still, our book-to-bill was roughly flat in the quarter. Sell-through revenues across our channel and our IWDs were flat year-over-year. Our Americas transport refrigeration business performed consistent with our expectations for the first quarter with mid-single-digit revenue growth. We expect this business to outperform the end markets, which are expected to be flat for the year. It's also worth noting that we expect quarterly bookings for both Americas and EMEA transport to be lumpy throughout the year. the timing of order books, customer order patterns and elevated backlogs. In our EMEA segment, our commercial HVAC business delivered another standout quarter. Bookings were robust and revenues were up more than 25% with strength in both equipment and services up nearly 40% and high single digits, respectively. Our transport refrigeration business also had a very strong quarter with revenues up mid-single digits. We expect this business to outperform the EMEA transport refrigeration markets, which are expected to be down low single digits to mid-single digits for the year. In our Asia-Pacific segment, the team also delivered strong results with revenues up high single digits, supported by broad-based growth in China and across the region. Commercial HVAC was again a standout with low change revenue growth led by services, which was up nearly 25%. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number 6. This slide does a nice job highlighting our overall performance in the quarter, which was strong across the board. Organic revenues were up 9%, adjusted EBITDA margins were up 100 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 26%. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up high single digits and low teens, respectively. Our high-performance flywheel continues to pay dividends with relentless investment in innovation, driving strong top line growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. Please turn to Slide number 7. We discussed the key revenue dynamics for the first quarter so I'll focus my comments on margins. We delivered strong margin expansion in each of our business segments and have highlighted the key margin drivers on the right side of the page. In each of our regions, strong price realization, volume growth and productivity combined to more than offset continued supply chain challenges and persistent inflation in the quarter. As we've highlighted previously, the supply chain is slowly improving, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2023. As an enterprise, we delivered about 6.5 points of price and about 2.5 points of volume in the quarter, which is largely in line with our expectations. We delivered strong volume growth in our commercial HVAC businesses in each region accompanied by strong leverage, which was partially offset by lower volumes in our residential business as those markets continue to normalize. As we discussed previously, we've earmarked approximately 30 basis points for incremental business reinvestment to accelerate the timing of key projects. This is above our average run rate of approximately 40 basis points annually for a total of approximately 70 basis points in 2023. While investment spending was less than 70 basis points in the first quarter, it was in line with our expectations based on the timing of projects. We expect to ramp up to 70 basis points in the second quarter and there is no change to our full year guidance of approximately 70 basis points. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number 8. We presented this slide on our fourth quarter earnings call to help provide color on our key markets. Overall, we had a very strong first quarter as expected, and our positive outlook for our segments and our end markets is largely unchanged. We see strong core demand for our sustainability-focused solutions continuing. We see the stacking effect of support of policy and regulatory changes that play to our unique strengths as a leading climate innovator as tailwinds for either early to mid-innings or future multiyear opportunities. We see the effect of tight supply chain slowly but steadily improving, and we see strong execution of our business operating system and unprecedented backlog supporting resiliency and improving visibility into 2023 and 2024. In our Americas segment, our overall outlook is relatively balanced between commercial and residential. We see our residential business continue to normalize through Q2. Our bias on our prior revenue estimates of the business being plus or minus low single digits for the year is now towards the lower end of that range or flat to down low single digits. While this may present a modest headwind to the second quarter, we see strength in our commercial HVAC business more than offsetting this on the full year. Our transport refrigeration business performed as planned in the first quarter, and we continue to expect to outperform the market for the year. In our EMEA segment, the first quarter was strong and in line with our expectations for both businesses, and our outlook for the year is unchanged. Likewise, for our Asia-Pacific segment, Q1 performance was strong, and our outlook for the full year is unchanged. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number 9. We're off to a strong start to the year and we continue to see slow but steady improvement in our supply chain. Additionally, bookings and backlog continued at high levels providing us with improving visibility into future revenues. All in, we're confident in raising the low end of our full year revenue and EPS guidance for 2023. We're raising our full year organic revenue growth guidance to between 7% and 8%, up from our prior guidance of 6% to 8%, reflecting strong results in the first quarter and improving visibility on the year. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.30 to $8.50, up from $8.20 to $8.50. We're also expecting to deliver free cash flow equal to or greater than net earnings. Other elements of our guidance remain largely unchanged with a few modest exceptions, mainly one additional point of M&A and associated impacts, higher interest expense related to debt refinancing in the first quarter and expected pension expense in 2023. Please see Page 18 of the presentation for additional details related to guidance to assist you with your models. As we've highlighted before, we paid close attention to our investment peer group and target top quartile revenue growth, EPS growth and free cash flow conversion as part of our annual planning process, and we monitor our progress throughout the year. We believe our full year guidance places us in the top quartile of the peer group on these metrics for 2023. In addition to our full year guidance, we believe it may be useful to provide a high-level construct regarding how to think about Q2 and the cadence of earnings. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth in the high single-digit range. which reflects a step down in pricing sequentially, given very high levels of pricing realized in 2022. It also reflects continued normalization and inventory optimization across our residential distribution channels, as Dave referenced earlier. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $2.50 and $2.55, which includes approximately 30 basis points of incremental investment spend in the second quarter versus the first quarter, as I discussed earlier. This EPS range is also consistent with our 3-year average for second quarter earnings as a percentage of full year earnings, which is approximately 30% at our full year EPS guidance midpoint of $8.40. Please go to Slide number 10. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023, including an incremental $60 million in 2023. We continue to invest these cost savings and high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio. Our continuous improvement mindset is an integral part of our business operating system, and it's designed to drive gross productivity each year to offset other inflation. While it's been extremely difficult to realize meaningful levels of productivity in recent years given the supply chain and other macro challenges, productivity has been improving as supply chains slowly recover and is contributing to our 25%-plus organic leverage target in 2023. Please go to Slide number 11. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide number 12, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment for 2023. Year-to-date through May, we deployed $720 million in cash with $170 million of dividends, $250 million and $300 million to share repurchases. We have significant dry powder with $2.9 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, and our shares remain attractive trading below our calculated intrinsic value. Our M&A pipeline remains active and we have committed or deployed approximately $500 million year-to-date to bolt-on leading technology acquisitions and equity investments, two of which Dave mentioned earlier, including a leading industrial process cooling technology business which closed on May 2 and will complement our portfolio in our EMEA commercial HVAC business. All in, we're on track to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash in 2023. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number 14. The key takeaway for our Thermo King business is that the transport refrigeration market forecasts for both North America and EMEA remain unchanged, and we expect to outperform each market in 2023. Our performance through the first quarter is on track to meet these expectations. The slide shows key data points on the markets and on Thermo King specifically to provide additional transparency and reference information. Please turn to Slide number 15. Act has updated their long-term forecast for refrigerated trailers, and they are projecting strong demand through 2028. The data supports the view we've been highlighting for some time now that this is a strong mid-40,000 unit market plus or minus a few percentage points. One key takeaway is that ACT has increased their 2024 forecast to 42,000 units, up from 40,000 units, which represents a 7% decline versus an 11% decline. In 2025, Act forecasts the market to increase 7% and return to 45,000 units and to continue growing low single digits through 2028. Both our Americas and EMEA Thermo King businesses are poised to continue to outperform their end markets through leading innovation and strong execution. We believe this is a GDP plus-plus business for us over the long term. Please turn to Slide number 16. In summary, we are positioned to outperform over the long term. Energy efficiency, decarbonization and sustainability megatrends continue to intensify, driving increased demand for our innovative products and services. We are delivering leading technology and innovation to address these trends and accelerate the world's progress, underpinned by our engaging uplifting culture. Our strong first quarter performance, diverse and resilient portfolio and unprecedented backlog gives us confidence in raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance and reaffirming our full year free cash flow conversion guidance. We believe we have the right strategy, the best team and a solid foundation in place to deliver strong performance in 2023 and differentiated shareholder returns over the long term. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Scott Davis with Melius. Your line is open. Scott Davis : You guys always give a lot of great detail and answer a lot of questions, which is helpful. But I haven't really heard you talk about mega projects specifically. And when I think about kind of these giant semi fabs and the EV facilities and everything that is on the list that folks are talking about, is this stuff starting to move into your backlogs? Are people starting to spec out the HVAC needs in those facilities? And if so, I'm just kind of guessing these are super complicated. I have to imagine a semi fab requires some pretty incredible engineering to get the cooling right, and perhaps you guys have an advantage in that regard. So I'll just open it up to that. Dave Regnery : And the short answer is, look, we're -- this high-tech industrial vertical, as we call it, we have a lot of strength in that vertical and we have for a number of years. Yes, we are starting to see early stages of some big orders coming in, specifically on the fab plant side of things. But again, I think the CHIPS and Science Act is really in front of us. And once that really starts to happen, you're going to see even greater closing of some of these big projects. So I think a lot of it's in front of us. We are seeing some. We're also seeing some of it on the EV battery plants. And that's certainly been a nice -- again, we classify this all of this high-tech industrial vertical, but it's certainly been a strength to us. And you're right, these are sophisticated operations that require kind of detail engineering, not everyone is as cookie-cutter as you might think, so there's always unique things. And our expertise in this vertical really allows us to have a lot of strength, and we'll continue to execute in the future. Scott Davis : And this is a little pie in the sky, but AI, the cooling of the chips, when you start talking about, I think it's something like 5-kilowatt going to 100-kilowatt and there's a lot of heat there. And I'm told there's a lot of white space because, frankly, the cooling of those chips is still -- whether we go all liquid or whether there's other kind of hybrid solutions. But are you guys involved at all working on technologies to be involved at all in some of that CHIP level cooling? Dave Regnery : Yes, absolutely. You're talking about immersion cooling, and that's certainly on the cutting edge. And yes, we're very active there. In fact, we made an equity investment in a company called Liquid Stack, which is really -- that's their expertise. We're partnering with them. And yes, we're certainly on the leading edge of that technology. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Dave, commercial HVAC bookings growth has remained really strong, low teens growth in EMEA despite maybe a little bit slowing against tough comps as you talked about in the Americas. Have you seen any slowing in any of your main commercial HVAC verticals in the Americas? Or is it really just tough comps? And then would you say the main difference in EAME is the strength of your thermal management system out there? And if it is, where are you in that buildout? And where are you in terms of bringing it into the U.S. Dave Regnery : Well, Andy, I think it's -- commercial HVAC has been strong globally for us. And I think the mega trends around decarbonization, they continue to intensify. We had a very strong start to the year here in the Americas. Order rates were up low single digits, but the backlog grew, and that's a great thing. If you go to EMEA, I mean, yes, I mean, the team there is just performing at a very high level. And you hit it, right? Thermal management systems is -- we have a differentiated technology and we're winning with our customers. If you think about the commercial HVAC EMEA business in 2022 was up 20%. In the first quarter, we were up 25%. Our equipment orders for commercial HVAC, I mean, we're up close to 40%. So I mean, this is great. The team is executing well. The other thing, too, I'd point out is that margins were very, very strong in Europe as well. If you remember a year ago, we were talking about more acute supply chain problems in Europe and a higher cost to serve our customers. And we are -- with spot buys and expedited freight. You see that pulling through now with productivity that the team has been able to deliver. So very strong in EMEA, very strong in the Americas and Asia-Pacific also performed quite well. Order rates were up low teens and really broad-based too, both in China and outside of China. So off to a great start here in 2023. And commercial HVAC business is certainly -- we're seeing a lot of demand for our products. Andy Kaplowitz : And I want to follow up on your comments on sort of the EMEA margin. Maybe for Chris, you talk about price versus cost benefit in Q1 for the year. I think you mentioned previously the 2% to 2.5% carryover price embedded in 2023. Has that gone up a bit? And as Dave mentioned, is it really you're comping against sort of and easier supply chains are better in EMEA and Asia, and that's sort of the big reasons why the margins were much stronger in those regions than versus the Americas? Or are you investing maybe more in the Americas versus those other regions? Chris Kuehn : Andy, it's a great question. If I go to EMEA margins first, I mean, if I go back a year ago, we saw very acute supply chain issues impacting that region and really unfortunately holding back revenue growth and lowering volumes. It also came with the product we get out the door, a lot of additional cost to serve our customers. And a year ago, it was very difficult to get leverage in that region. What you're seeing coming through here in the first quarter, and you guys will see this in the 10-Q that gets filed, you'll see 9 points of price in EMEA and about 6.5 points of volume. And with that volume came strong leverage, and we're starting to see some productivity come through within a slowly but improving supply chain. So I think about the margins around productivity improvements on a year-over-year basis, stronger volume with good incrementals and pricing continues to remain strong in the region as well. So really nice start to that team. I think you mentioned a question on maybe price overall for the company. Enterprise-wide on the full year, we're probably still in that 200 basis points to 300 basis points on a full year price. And I would bias our full year revenue growth more to the volume side than to the price side on the full year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just wanted to start with the sort of the backlog outlook and orders. And I guess one approach is just not report the orders when they're down in quarter. But if we look at over the balance of the year, how are you thinking about the sort of the book-to-bill ratio, let's say, -- just trying to understand a little bit better, Dave, your commentary around that $6 billion backlog at year-end perhaps being a floor number. Any color as you're thinking about book-to-bill by region or the market in terms of commercial versus transport? Dave Regnery : Yes. Look, our order rates for the first quarter were actually flattish, okay, but our backlog increased by $400 million. So we thought we had a real high backlog at the end of 2022 at $6.9 billion, it's now $7.3 billion. We will enter 2024 with a very inflated backlog. And we're kind of using $6 billion just as -- just to demonstrate the strength. If you think about any year we go into, the backlog typically represents about 20% of the forward revenue. We'll be far in excess of that going into 2024. So the book-to-bill, if you just do the simple math while we're -- looking at our midpoint on revenue, yes, it would come down a bit from what we're seeing right now. But I would tell you, the first quarter was exceptional and it was a little bit stronger than even we thought, especially on our commercial HVAC standpoint. Our commercial HVAC business on a 2-year stack in the first quarter, it's up 35% for orders. So I mean it's very, very strong right now and we're seeing a lot of demand. And you heard Scott talk about some of the tailwinds that are to come, some of the mega projects out there with the CHIPS and Science Act and IRA as it starts to kick in here in the -- hopefully, the fourth quarter. That will be an additional tailwind that we're going to see into 2024 and beyond. Julian Mitchell : Then my second question would just be on the Americas operating margin for the year. So I suppose one, I think some investors may have thought maybe you'd have higher operating leverage in the first half and the sort of mid-20s number because of price cost, tailwinds to margins and the last sort of bout of transformation, savings as well as the good volume growth. So I understand the sort of investment reference that Chris had made. Anything else going on in that Americas margin? And also, when we're thinking about second half operating leverage in the Americas, does that stay at that mid-20s rate that you've got in the first half? Anything sort of moving around there? Chris Kuehn : Julian, this is Chris. I'll jump in. Yes, the Americas saw a nice margin expansion in the first quarter, 90 basis points op margin expansion, about 50 basis points EBITDA margin expansion really led by our commercial HVAC business. We saw declines in residential in the quarter, and Thermo King was right in line with our expectations, plus or minus. So I think it's really just the combination of the mix in the quarter, where residential volumes were down but we saw very strong growth in commercial HVAC. I think on the guide, as we've guided Q2 and then raised the low end of the guide on both revenue and earnings on the full year, would suggest maybe some leverage, it's a little lower second half versus first half. But I'll tell you, we're very confident in our full year guide. I think the performance in the first quarter was very strong. And at the same time, we've got a strong backlog entering into the second quarter. And as Dave talked out, the guide for the backlog going into 2024 we expect to be very high as well. So we have a lot of confidence in the full year guide. The first quarter, it's really our smallest quarter of the year. It's about 17% of our earnings on a full year basis. And let's get into the cooling season and we'll update you in a couple of months. But we're really happy with where we started. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : I just wanted to ask if you're seeing any evidence of price elasticity in the residential channel given the volumes are a little bit lower across the industry, just -- or any sort of competitive price movements downward. Chris Kuehn : Gautam, it's Chris. I'll start. Look, I think pricing continues to be strong and as we expected in the quarter for residential. We're ready for the cooling season with the inventory we have on hand, but we're not seeing anything from a price elasticity perspective that you're referring to. Things remain to be very disciplined as we see today, and we're ready for the cooling season. Gautam Khanna : And just a quick follow-up on the M&A pipeline, if you could talk about what kinds of things you're looking at. And is it more of what we've seen before with technology add-ons, anything sizable in the pipeline that might be attractive? Dave Regnery : Yes. Gautam, I'll start on that. At the end of the day, we're going to get an opportunity to see everything as a major global HVAC player. In the second quarter -- or in the first quarter here, we announced MTA. Chris talked about that and we've actually announced yesterday. A great example of what we do really well. This is a technology in industrial process cooling, it's in EMEA, great technology at an enterprise level, the revenue is less than 1% for the enterprise. Margins are nice, they fit nicely into the business with our strong scale -- with our strong channel, we're able to scale these acquisitions quite quickly. So we'll look at everything. We'll be disciplined, and we're going to continue to execute the strategy that we've been executing too, and we've had a lot of success with it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : So look, we talked a lot about the backlog. Clearly, the trends there are impressive in terms of what that means for the revenue story. I guess I'd like to talk a little bit about how backlog margins have trended. And I guess where I'm coming from is some of what the answers have already touched on is these opposing forces where supply chain and price cost, it seemed like they should probably be improving in the backlog. But you also have some of these larger projects, where I would imagine in commercial HVAC, maybe a lower margin upfront and you get paid more on that longer tail of things like service. How would you carve that for us as you're thinking about the margin in backlog today and maybe where that trends? Chris Kuehn : Josh, it's Chris. I'll start. We see the backlog is still over 90% nonresidential. So that would be primarily commercial HVAC plus our transport businesses globally. But price/cost, we like the margins in backlog. But remember that price scenario, that's going to be a tougher comp as we work throughout the balance of the year. Just to remind investors, we really led with price in 2022. And so we're going to have a tough comp as we work throughout the year on incremental price. Our product management teams have done an outstanding job staying ahead of inflation over the last couple of years, and we were price cost positive in the first quarter on a dollar basis and a margin basis. So I think that's an opportunity. But again, that headline price number is going to be a tougher comp as we work throughout the year. We have a lot of confidence in the 25% or better operating leverage on the full year, and that's going to come from multiple parts of the bridge, right? We're confident that 20 to 30 basis points of price over cost. The first quarter start gives us confidence on that on a full year basis. But we expect to see good incremental on volume, some productivity return as supply chain normalizes and really leverage all parts of the P&L to go drive the performance for the year. Josh Pokrzywinski : And then I guess just sticking with the same kind of follow-up on some of the questions around some of these bigger projects. How do you think about the crowding out between more of the policy-led stuff and stimulus versus private? Obviously, a lot of focus on the higher interest rates and maybe tougher liquidity situation coming from the regional banks. And I don't know how relevant that's going to be for like HVAC retrofit. But I guess, the wrench can only turn so fast and we still have labor bottlenecks. Is there a crowding out that you guys think happens on kind of the IRA stuff maybe versus more private demand here over the next year or 2? Dave Regnery : Yes. Well, we haven't seen that to date, Josh. It's a good question. But at the end of the day, we think they are all opportunities really in front of us. And we are -- as far as labor shortages, we have so many programs in place now to really train all of our employees at grassroots level. So that's starting to get a lot better for us, and we're not concerned about any crowding out as far as being able to meet the demand. And our account managers, our sales team, they're all over this, right? And they're well trained and they're able to go to the most attractive verticals and really drive demand. And that's what we're seeing right now. And you see it in our results. I mean, our order rates are just tremendous right now. And I look at our team and what they've been able to do in EMEA right now and all those opportunities there that are -- we talk about IRA, but there's other policy that are happening in Europe right now that are really helping drive demand, and we're able to capitalize upon it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is open. Chris Snyder : I wanted to ask on commercial HVAC demand. Obviously, orders can reflect a bunch of things, comps, lead times. But when you were speaking with customers, do you sense any easing of demand, whether it's the result of macro uncertainty or just higher cost of financing? Dave Regnery : Chris, good question. Look, we haven't seen that yet. And in fact, we continue to see very strong demand. And I think the whole megatrends around decarbonization continue. And the world is getting warmer, and we need to take action and more of our customers realize that, and we have some solutions out there right now that can have a dramatic impact on how we decarbonize the built environment. So we have not seen anything slowing down right now.  And that really is on a global basis for our commercial HVAC business. If you look at the Americas, we play across all verticals. I think there's like 14 different verticals that we track. Maybe there's a little bit of softness in office, but there's a lot of strength in high tech that we talked about earlier. Education continues to be strong. Europe, we've been strong really across many verticals with our solutions there. In Asia-Pacific, again, very strong start to the year. So we haven't seen any slowing yet, Chris, but it's a great start to the year for Trane Technologies, and it gives us a lot of confidence in our full year guide. Chris Snyder : Appreciate that. And then following up on price cost. The company had been running ahead or kind of staying price cost positive. When we see the year-to-date reflation in metal, does that change how you're thinking about incremental price later in '23 as you try to kind of maintain that staying ahead on price cost into '24? Chris Kuehn : Yes. Let me jump in, Chris. So it's a dynamic market around Tier 1 metals, and we started the year 3, 6 months ago, thinking we could be in a really deflationary environment and that really hasn't proven through. As I said earlier, our product management team members have done an outstanding job thinking about cost inputs, value to the customer and staying ahead on price. We remain confident that we're going to be price/cost positive on the year. The start in the first quarter gives us a lot of confidence on the 20 basis points to 30 basis points price/cost spread that we have in the full year guide. We know that pricing gets to be a tougher comp as we work throughout the year. But we remain nimble. If there's further movement of inflationary commodities or we continue to see some inflation certainly in Tier 2 around wage and energy, which we have baked into the guide. But if things were to become more inflationary. We have the nimbleness in the company, and I think the proven track record that we've priced effectively. So we have a lot of confidence on where we're going to be on the full year and ultimately just staying very nimble to what happens in the marketplace. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : So Dave, just maybe I'll start on resi HVAC. So interesting to see it flat, but your organic growth this quarter was down mid-single digits. I'm assuming pricing had to be up. So first, did I get my math right? It seems like volumes were probably down double digits, direct volumes were down double digits in the Americas. So my question is, is that right? And then secondly, what kind of line of sight do you have to that improving and what's embedded in the guide? Dave Regnery : Yes, your math is about right. So you think about it on a revenue basis, we were down mid-single digits, on a unit basis we were down in the mid-teens. Pricing was positive in the business. There's a little bit less than the company average, which is the first time that's happened in a while. But again, we have some very strong comps here in the resi business. The sell-through, which is really how we're looking at this business right now was flat, right? So we don't see it falling off a cliff. If you look at inventory levels in our IWD, our independent wholesale distributors, maybe they're a bit high but that will normalize through Q2, nothing alarming. This is a business that we have a lot of innovation coming through. We have some great brands, some great products, great distributors and a great management team. So it's early in the year. It's the first quarter. So we'll wait to see how the cooling season starts. But we don't see this business falling off a cliff. And we have this guide -- in our guide, okay? So it gives us confidence in our guide with what we have projected right now. Joe Ritchie : And then going back to the margins in EMEA, I mean, just -- I know that you had an easier comp because of some of the issues that occurred last year, but still a 17% margin in the business. The start of the year is pretty darn good. I guess my question is, is that kind of like the jumping off point now for the rest of the year? Because I'm assuming revenue/volumes are going to be higher through the remaining three quarters. And so it just kind of like the floor for margins in EMEA for the year? Chris Kuehn : Yes. Joe, it's Chris. Look, our expectation for the region would be that they'll deliver 25% or better leverage on the full year -- organic leverage on the full year. Q1 is off to a nice start. But as you said and as we commented before, it's really an easier comp versus some real challenges we had in the business a year ago. Supply chain got better as we got to the end part of 2022. The fourth quarter, we saw a strong revenue growth in EMEA from our commercial HVAC business, and they were really hurt first and hard with the supply chain challenges. So we have a lot of confidence that team can deliver this year and the backlog continues to grow with their innovative products. So let's see how it kind of plays out. But we're confident we're going to deliver strong margin improvement on a full year basis for the region. And keep in mind, TK EMEA markets there are expected to be down low to mid-single digits. We expect to outperform. But all in, we expect to have a strong year in the EMEA segment this year. Dave Regnery : Joe, you're right. again, just Joe, a great start to our -- it really is. I'm so proud of what that team has been able to deliver. So fantastic. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Congrats on the execution on the quarter. Dave Regnery : Appreciate it. Chris Kuehn : Thanks. Steve Tusa : So 9% price in EMEA, I know we can wait for the Q, but what was it in the other two segments? Chris Kuehn : Yes, Steve, it's Chris. So it was a little over 6 points in Americas. So think of that as 6 points of price in the Americas, pretty much in line with the enterprise. EMEA, we said 8.9 points of price, and Asia was around 4 points of price in the quarter. Steve Tusa : And then just in the back half here, there's like kind of strange comps from last year. You had the China dynamics. Europe had a pretty good second half as well on volume. How do we -- I know you don't like to kind of guide by quarter. But like you guided to high singles. You're running in the first half at high singles so far. Are there any comps in the back half that are volatile? Or is it pretty smooth? Maybe just help us out with the non-U.S. businesses and how you expect organic growth year-over-year to play out in 3 and 4Q. Chris Kuehn : Yes. I think as we get to the fourth quarter -- well, let me start with Asia, right, given the lockdowns in the second quarter of 2022. We saw muted growth in Q2 a year ago. The business was able to recover very nicely in the third and fourth quarter last year. So Asia may have a little bit of tougher comps in the second half just given the cadence of how earnings played out and the lockdowns from COVID played out in China a year ago. I mentioned just earlier in EMEA, for commercial HVAC, the business really through the third quarter of last year had some very acute supply chain challenges. We're not out of the woods yet, but that continued to get better in the fourth quarter, and we saw that getting better here in the first quarter as well. So I think we're -- fingers crossed, that continues to be a nice tailwind for the business on a year-over-year. But as you get later in the year, I think you'll see a little bit of a headwinds begin to the fourth quarter there. But TK, if I go to the Americas side of the house, the back half of the year for TK Americas, that will be a bit of a tough comp, very strong growth we saw in the third and fourth quarter in the Americas last year. So yes, there was a little bit of tough comps coming in the second half in a few of the businesses but we have such strength in the commercial HVAC businesses as well that we're really confident in the full year guide. Steve Tusa : And then just on -- I just want to clarify some of these resi numbers. So you said revs down mid-singles. The sell-through comment being flat, is that revenue or is that units? Dave Regnery : That will be revenue, Steve. That would be revenue. Steve Tusa : So basically, like through your independence, your volume was down probably more like, I don't know, like 20% or something like that, just through the independents? Dave Regnery : They certainly normalized their inventory in the first quarter. We've seen that happen. Like I said earlier, inventory may be a bit high, but it really depends on how the cooling season kicks off. It's the first quarter. right? And as you know, this is the smallest quarter. We'll wait until the cooling season starts, and hopefully, it starts real soon. Steve Tusa : How's April so far? Dave Regnery : I think it's -- the cooling season hasn't started. So we're still in that shoulder part of the year. But we'll see. It's forecasted to get real warm here in May. So we'll see how it goes. Operator : Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Just one follow-up on resi and then just a different topic on the M&A from you. Just the price in resi below the 6.5% range, little surprised to hear that given the year change and the mix effect associated with that. Maybe you're not including mix when you say price, or perhaps you're still selling a lot of older units in the quarter. Could you just maybe clarify a little bit what's going on there? Chris Kuehn : Jeff, you're right. We're not including the price benefit from the SEER change in that price number. We consider that as part of volume. So this would be more pure on a year-over-year basis. Dave Regnery : Put that as mix, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : We'll call it mix. And then just on the deals, a 2% revenue impact right on the $16 billion revenue base last year, that's $320 million of sales you're guiding for the partial year on deals, right, on $500 million expended. That sounds like a pretty good chunk of revenue for that amount of dollar spent. So maybe just a little color on the margin rates in these businesses. Do I have that math right? What percentage of the year do you expect what you just announced to actually be in the year? When does this stuff close? Chris Kuehn : Yes, Jeff, it really is the contribution of three acquisitions that's leading to that roughly 2 points of revenue growth from M&A in 2023. One relates to the ALCO acquisition we closed in October of last year. So you've got about 9 months of that revenue coming through in 2023 that we're calling out as inorganic. Fourth quarter would be a comp would just be part of our organic results. Dave just mentioned, we closed on MTA just yesterday. It is an industrial process cooling business in EMEA. So we'll start picking up the revenues from that business, also a partial year. Think about it as 8 months of revenue this year. And then the pending acquisition that we've announced in the life sciences vertical in the Americas, that's not closed yet. We expect that to close sometime in the second quarter. We made an estimate of that here in the full year. So all in, it's the combination of those 3 businesses that's getting us to roughly 2 points of revenue growth. And look, the contribution margin in year one, it's low just given the integration costs. But we have a great track record of taking bolt-on acquisitions and bringing them into our channels, selling through with our robust sales forces and ultimately really driving very strong returns in subsequent years. So in the year, it's about $0.03 positive on an EPS basis with that leverage. And ultimately, we'll see what kind of plays out for the year, but it's still positive and slightly accretive by the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Dave, I don't know but about your neighborhood but still pretty cold up here. So make sure [Indiscernible] you week. Dave Regnery : It's warming up, Nigel. It's warming up. Jeff Sprague : Okay. it's coming, it's coming. So obviously, one of your competitors is making a pretty big splash in European residential markets. How do you characterize the importance of Trane being a player in European residential heating specifically? I'm not saying a multi-billion dollar deal, but do you see opportunities to be a player there in a smaller scale, perhaps? Dave Regnery : Yes, great question. I mean, we really like our portfolio in Europe. You think about it in the commercial HVAC space where we play, we're having a lot of success. We have differentiated offerings that we're able to provide to our customers. And you see the results. I mean, our thermal management systems there, we've eliminated or significantly reduced the need for fossil fuel for heating in all geographic climates. And you could see the team's results. And like I said earlier, our revenue in 2022, up 20%, first quarter, 25%, equipment revenue, 40%. So we're going to continue to execute on our strategy in Europe. We're having a lot of success. The team is high-powered and performing extremely well. And we have so much innovation that's coming through the pipeline that I get excited just talking about it. And as I said earlier, we get the opportunity to look at a lot of M&A deals being a global HVAC player, and we'll continue to do that and we'll continue to be disciplined. And we'll make sure we make the right investments for Trane Technologies and our shareholders. Jeff Sprague : And then maybe it's Chris. We're kind of up to the end of the $3 million program transformation savings. Is this it? This is the end of the kind of the big part of your move? Or do you see the potential for like another way perhaps of initiatives? Chris Kuehn : Nigel, thanks for the question. Look, we're on a really good track to realize the incremental $60 million in savings this year, We continue to deploy that back into the business through reinvestment and innovation in the portfolio also gives us confidence on delivering 25% or better operating leverage on the full year. But look, the company has always prided itself on lean thinking. And I would tell you that as we move forward, there's always going to be opportunities for us to lean on operations and drive cost improvements. I think another area of opportunity for the company is the ability to call back on some of the productivity that's been very challenged over the last few years to deliver on supply chain challenges, higher cost to serve customers. Dave talked in past calls about spot buys and being exposed to those markets and higher costs. Those are really great opportunities for the company to get back to basics, get back to productivity offsetting off inflation. And we're seeing a little bit of that come through in the first quarter with our commercial EMEA business. And we'll see how that kind of plays out for the year. But I would tell you that -- we'll update you more as we work throughout the year, but I'm really excited on the productivity side and I'm excited we still have a lot more opportunities to take costs out in the business. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Question about indoor air quality. Has the whole urgency around that theme faded? And understandably, you've showcased all the decarbonization benefits and climate change, and that makes perfect sense. But has the driver of indoor air quality, is that faded at all? Because originally, you were talking about a 200 basis point lift for quite a period of time. Dave Regnery : Deane, it's a good question. I mean we've embedded indoor air quality into our applied systems. And I would tell you that -- I've been in this industry a long time, 10 years ago, we used to just have the conversation about indoor air quality in the health care vertical. We have that now in all verticals. So you might not read about it, but I would tell you it's still prevalent and we talk about it with our customers. And they talk about it with us. I mean, I think everyone's been educated on the importance of indoor air quality, the importance of fresher exchange, the importance of being able to balance that with energy consumption -- and we've done a great job of helping our customers work through that. So no, it's certainly part of our business. It's certainly part of our offering and it's top of mind of many of our customers. Deane Dray : Yes. And I see that with the education stimulus spending that it's usually one of the top priorities. Dave Regnery : Absolutely, absolutely. Deane Dray : And then second question on the incremental 70 basis points of spending reinvestment. Can you give us some examples of where that's going and a sense of the returns? Dave Regnery : Yes. We really like the digital space. We really like the electrification of our portfolio. We really like optimizing our operations with automation, just to name a few. But our innovation pipeline is very robust. It's very full. Three times a year, I actually get to -- we have a deep dive on our innovation pipeline. It's the best four hours I spend some times in the quarter because it's just so exciting to talk to our engineers and to see what they've invented and the impact that it could have on not only decarbonizing the built environment really helping our customers save on energy costs and improve indoor air quality. So it's very robust right now. We love to invest in our business. It's -- we have a proven track record here, and we're going to continue to do that more in the future as well. Chris Kuehn : Deane, I'd add on the investment side, we had a normal level of investments in the first quarter, wanted to highlight that into the second quarter, we do expect that level of investments to ramp up to 70 basis points. We still see that being around 70 basis points for the full year, but that will be a ramp-up into Q2 as we just continue to see very strong projects, as Dave outlined. And let me come back to just a comment on EMEA as well. I know a lot of questions around EMEA margins, maybe just to highlight, in the first quarter, we saw growth both in commercial HVAC and in the Thermo King business. Important to know that the Thermo King markets in Europe are expected to be down low to mid-single. So we're probably not expecting to see that outgrowth in Thermo King each and every quarter of the year. That's going to be an area we'll see how the year plays out. But nice to see both businesses deliver in Q1. But that will be a little lumpy and choppy as we think about Thermo King for the balance of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Just a follow-up on institutional spending. Can you just chat again -- clearly a key market schools you've talked about. But can you talk about what's happening with the hospital spending? Because I know there was a pullback during COVID because of the budgetary issues. Are we sort of seeing cumulative catch-up or are hospitals still in trouble? If you could just talk about that key end market. Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, we've been strong in the health care vertical forever. I think. As I said, we track all 14 different verticals, but health care is certainly one that we have a lot of strength in. And it really -- the reason why we have the strength there, Andy, it's a complex sale. And hospitals, they have varying degrees of requirements, especially around fresh air exchange. So you're going to have a different application in a surgical suite versus you're going to have in a hospital room. So we're still seeing strength in health care. But to be fair, we've always seen strength in health care because our solutions are really built around those kind of more complex situations that we're able to capitalize on. Andrew Obin : Yes. Just a follow-up. Headlines on pricing I think Daikin introduce lower-priced product in the U.S. on the resi side. I think we've heard yesterday at the meeting that Aon, it's the first sort of price -- they rescinded a price increase actually on the commercial side. As supply chains are getting looser, do you feel that people can get more competitive? Or you think there's still enough demand there to support steady pricing? Chris Kuehn : Andrew, I'd say, look, demand remains strong, and we -- it's an industry that typically retains price and is disciplined on price. I won't necessarily talk about potential pricing actions they may do throughout the year. As I mentioned before, our product management teams, our business units have done an outstanding job taking all the inputs in to lead on price the last two years, and a good strong performance here in the first quarter as well. So I do think we'll remain proactive and be prudent. And I think our track record hopefully speaks for itself that we can really have a lot of confidence on the 20 basis points to 30 basis points of price over cost in the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Nicole DeBlase : So just -- there's been a lot of focus on the EMEA margins on this call, but the Asia-Pac margins and the operating leverage was also really, really strong. So can we just talk about how you guys are seeing that progressing through the rest of the year? Chris Kuehn : Yes, Nicole, it's Chris. I would say, certainly the second quarter, but even in the first quarter last year we saw some parts of the China economy and these COVID lockdowns. And so as we entered into lockdown, it certainly cost a lot more money to keep customers happy and trying to get products out where you could in limited situations. And now we're comping against a little bit easier comps as we think about the first half of 2023. So first off, the demand in Asia remains very strong. We continue to expect very strong performance from the team, and they had a great first quarter. Comps probably get a little bit better in the second half given the partial reopening we saw in the second half of 2022. But look, very strong growth, not only on the revenue side, but bookings were up high teens for commercial HVAC in Asia. Services were up nearly 25% in the quarter. So I think our innovation and then the verticals that we play in, in Asia really played through very well in the year. And great job by our team there. Dave Regnery : Yes. Thanks for noticing Nicole. I mean, Asia, sometimes we don't talk enough about it. But what a great leadership team we have there. And they really have been leaders for train technology with innovation and the team just executed extremely well in the first quarter, a great start to the year. And to be fair, all of our segments really executed very strongly in the quarter. And it just speaks to the resiliency of our portfolio and it just gives us lots of confidence in our full year guide. So I certainly appreciate the question. Nicole DeBlase : And then on the TK order book, are you guys now fully booked out to 2023? And I guess what's the status of the order book? Is it actually open to accept new orders? Chris Kuehn : Yes. Nicole, so we opened up the second half of the year order book mid- to late March. So orders started to come in a little bit in the first quarter, but we would expect that to really get filled up in the second quarter. And we have a lot of confidence that from what we can see with the backlog entering Q2 and the forward look that our guide in the full year, we're going to outperform the markets both in the Americas and in EMEA for the full year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Would love to dig into the services trend a little bit more. I mean, that 25% year-over-year in China, maybe to the extent that reopening played into that and you can comment. But just the overall trends in services and how you expect that to trend over the course of the year. Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, services is a great part of Trane Technologies. It represents about one-third of our total business. And if you look at it over a 5-year period, we've had a compound annual growth rate globally in our service business in high single digits. In the first quarter, we were double digits. So I mean, it's a really strong business. It really differentiates us with our customers in China, yes, really strong start to the year. Some of that was obviously, the comps year-over-year just because there's a lot of restrictions still, specifically in China at this time last year. But I would tell you, our service business is a very strong business. We invest heavily in our service business. And it's just a -- it's a great business. And it's very, very resilient as well even during 2020 COVID where we didn't have access to many buildings, our service business was flat. And these products are more and more sophisticated today, and they require OEM service and we're able to provide that for our customers. So thanks for the question. I mean, service is a big part of who we are as Trane Technologies. Noah Kaye : Yes. And that actually ties into the next question. I think in talking about the incremental spend, you called out the digital investments and maybe pulling forward some of that. Just would love an understanding of the road map to the extent you can share with us and how that plays into the services strategy. Are we looking at some meaningful refreshes or additions to the digital suite over the course of the year? Dave Regnery : No. Look, being connected to our assets is nothing new to Trane Technologies. We're connected to over, what number is it now, well over 30,000 buildings and millions of different assets. So we love being connected to our assets. And now think about the next is, how do you even get smarter with all the data that you have, and think about how you could actually have buildings operate more efficiently. And so when I talk about digital, those are the things that we're working on. It's no longer the service tech gets deployed when something is not operating properly. It's not operating properly because it's using too much energy. And that's the space that we're into here. And we really like the digital space and service, and it really is a tailwind to our service business. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on today's call. And as always, we'll be around to answer any questions that you have over the next -- well, today and the next coming days and weeks. And we'll also be on the road at a couple of conferences. So we'll be looking forward to seeing folks on the road or in person through a variety of events soon. Thanks, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to slide 2.

Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, please go to slide 3 and I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Zach, and everyone, for joining us on today's call. Let me begin with a few comments on our purpose as a company : to boldly challenge what's possible for a sustainable world. Our purpose is at the heart of our strategy, which is linked to powerful megatrends like climate change. This enables us to drive differentiated financial results and shareholder returns over the long term. The recent news on climate change has been sobering. Water temperatures off the Florida coast recently soared to over 100 degrees. We've seen deadly heat waves in parts of the United States, Europe and Asia in one of the Earth's hottest summers on record. In fact, scientists say these temperatures are likely the warmest the planet has seen in 120,000 years, and have dangerous effects on the environment, the economy and human life. Urgent action is needed to limit global warming and preserve our planet for the next generation. Our customers are seeking sustainable solutions and choosing Trane Technologies as their partner in de-carbonizing the built environment and the cold chain. We are leading the way with our innovation and the result is long-term value creation across the board for our team, our customers, our shareholders and for the planet. Moving to slide number 4. Our global team continues to execute at a high level and delivered another quarter of strong performance, showcasing the benefits of our diverse, resilient portfolio. Organic revenue was up 11%. Adjusted operating margins expanded 110 basis points and adjusted EPS grew 24%. We delivered 30%-plus organic leverage across the enterprise and in each segment, led by our commercial HVAC businesses in each region. Our residential HVAC business continued to normalize and was further impacted by a difficult comp versus the second quarter of last year when revenues were up 30%. Net, on a two-year stack, residential revenues were up mid-teens in Q2. Importantly, we're delivering strong results while increasing business reinvestments. We're accelerating high ROI projects in focused areas, including digital, electrification and factory automation. These investments are flowing through our segment results as well as through corporate expenses for enterprise-wide initiatives to drive innovation, growth and productivity well into the future. Bookings remained robust after reaching unprecedented levels in 2021, with nearly 30% bookings growth. In 2021, bookings exceeded revenue by approximately $2.7 billion, nearly doubling our backlog in a single year to $5.4 billion. During 2022, bookings grew more modestly, up 5%. However, the sharp increase in absolute bookings in 2021 translated 5% bookings growth in 2022 into another 27% increase in backlog. Net, 2021 and 2022 are both important drivers of our strong backlog position of $7 billion at the end of the second quarter, which is roughly two and half times historical levels. We've been encouraging investors to look at absolute booking levels and backlog in addition to growth rates to gain a more complete understanding of the strength of our business. Further, when looking at growth rates for Trane Technologies, it's important to consider a three-year stack that includes 2021 for the reasons discussed. Commercial HVAC continues to be a standout across our segments globally. In the second quarter, commercial HVAC bookings were up nearly 40% in each region on a 3-year stack, supporting revenue growth of high-teens in both the Americas and EMEA and 45% in Asia. Additionally, our commercial HVAC book-to-bill ratios were effectively 100% or higher in each region. Our end markets continue to be healthy overall, and we believe we are well positioned for strong growth in 2023. While it's premature to dial in an outlook for 2024, continued high levels of demand and our extremely strong backlog position, particularly across our commercial HVAC businesses globally, puts us in a strong position to drive growth in 2024 as well. We expect to enter 2024 with elevated backlog of more than $6 billion. To put that in perspective, backlog has historically represented approximately 20% of the next year's revenue. It's also worth noting that $2 billion of our $7 billion in current backlog is for equipment to be delivered in 2024. This is approximately five times the level of backlog for the next fiscal year versus historical trends at the end of the second quarter. Our strong results through the first half combined with healthy end markets, and backlog that remains two and a half times norms position us well to raise our full year 2023 guidance. Chris will discussion in more detail later in prepared remarks. Please to slide number 5. As we discussed bookings in revenue growth were broad based globally, with particular strength in our commercial HVAC business in all regions. Enterprise in Americas booking were down 5% and 8% respectively, largely due to softness in our Americas residential business, which was down approximately 20% in the quarter, as that business continues to normalize. Excluding the impact of residential bookings declined. Enterprise bookings were up 1% and Americas bookings were down low single digits. In our America segment, commercial HVAC bookings were down mid single digits against high teens growth comp in the prior year. Absolute bookings remained robust with growth of approximately 40% on a three year stack. Commercial HVAC revenues were up high teens and quarter strong growth in both equipment and services. Even with strong revenue growth, the book-to-bill ratio was approximately 100%. Commercial HVAC backlog remains highly elevated at three times historical levels. Residential HVAC revenues were down as expected as the business continues to normalize. Revenues were down low teens. However, it's important to note that the team delivered leading revenue growth of 30% in the second quarter of 2022. On a two year stack, the business was up mid-teens. In our transport refrigeration business, we delivered strong bookings and revenue growth up approximately 40% and 30% respectively. Revenue strength was broad based in North America with the big three truck trailer and APU\u2019s, up approximately 50%. In our newest segment, our commercial HVAC business delivered another strong quarter. Bookings were up mid single digits on top of low teams growth comp in the prior year. Revenues were up high teens with strength in both equipment and services, up mid 20s and high single digits respectively. Our transport refrigeration business is executing well in a modestly down market. We expect the EMEA weighted average transport markets to be down low single digits to mid single digits in 2023 and for our Thermo King business style performed and to be relatively flat for the year. This revenue growth of mid single digits in Q1 and revenues down low single digits in Q2 are well positioned to hit this target for the full year. In our Asia-Pacific segment, the team delivered strong results, with bookings up mid single digits versus bookings up mid teens in the prior year. Revenues were very strong up 41%. China results were robust with bookings and revenues up 20% and 40% respectively. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to slide number six. We delivered strong revenue growth, margin expansion and EPS growth again in the second quarter. Organic revenues were up 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were up 100 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 24%. And at an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up low teens and high single digits, respectively. Our high-performance flywheel continues to pay dividends with relentless investments in innovation, driving strong top line growth, margin expansion, EPS growth and powerful free cash flow. Please turn to slide number seven. We've discussed the key revenue dynamics for the second quarter, so I'll focus my comments on margins. We delivered strong margin expansion in each of our business segments and have highlighted the key margin drivers on the right side of the page. In each of our regions, as the supply chain continues to improve, we're driving strong leverage on volume growth, along with strong price realization and improving productivity. Near term, challenges continue in pockets of our business with associated costs, and we are managing these well across our segments as reflected in our results. As an enterprise, we delivered about six points of volume and about five points of price in the quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations on both price and volume. Volume growth was robust in our commercial HVAC businesses, accompanied by strong organic leverage in excess of 30% in each region. Americas performance was led by strength in commercial HVAC and aided by robust growth in our Americas transport refrigeration business, more than offsetting continued normalization of our residential business. EMEA delivered strong incrementals in margins after accounting for approximately nine points of M&A growth in the quarter, which negatively impacted reported leverage given year one integration costs. As we discussed previously, we've earmarked 70 basis points for incremental business reinvestment in 2023, which is about 30 basis points higher than normal to accelerate the timing of key projects. This is included in our guidance and reflected in segment margins and partially in corporate expenses each quarter. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to slide number 8. Looking forward, we see continued strong underlying demand for sustainable solutions well into the future. We see the stacking effect of policy and regulatory changes that play to our unique strengths as a leading climate innovator as tailwinds that are either early to mid-innings or future multiyear opportunities. The pace of these tailwinds has only accelerated in recent years, and with the realities of climate change all around us, it's likely we'll see this pace continue. The tailwinds impact all of our businesses as 100% of our portfolio is focused on driving more sustainable solutions for our customers. In our Americas segment, our overall outlook is relatively unchanged. We see commercial strength continuing to outweigh impacts from ongoing normalization of our residential business. We expect residential to continue to normalize through Q3, but to improve from Q2, and we expect the normalization process to be complete in 2023. Commercial faces tough comps in the second half of the year with less contribution from price. So we'd expect growth rates to remain strong but moderate from the first half of 2023. There's no change to our transport refrigeration outlook overall. ACT has modestly lowered their forecast for 2023 from flattish to a decline of low single digits, largely related to trucking OEM build constraints. We expect our Thermo King business in the Americas to outperform with low to mid single-digit growth for the year. One additional callout is related to the timing of our revenues in our Thermo King business. In the first half of the year, Thermo King delivered 20% growth, outpacing the North America transport markets, which were flat overall. A portion of that outgrowth was driven by timing of customer deliveries committed in the first half versus the second half of the year. Additionally, Thermo King delivered extremely strong results in Q3 of 2022, up 60%. Given this difficult comp and the timing dynamics between the first half and the second half, we expect our Thermo King business to be down approximately 10% in the third quarter. In our EMEA segment, the second quarter was strong and our outlook for the full year is also unchanged. Like the Americas, commercial HVAC faces tough comps with less contribution from price in the second half of the year, so we would expect growth rates to moderate. Our Thermo King business in EMEA is unchanged. The forecast for the overall market calls for low single-digit to mid single-digit decline, and we expect our Thermo King business to be flattish. Turning to Asia Pacific. Our outlook for the region is largely unchanged, with strength continuing in key verticals as highlighted. Our team delivered a better than expected second quarter against a relatively soft comp from the prior year given COVID-19 lockdowns in China. The strong Q2 results pulled in a modest amount of revenue from the third quarter based on timing of customer deliveries. Overall, the year is shaping up as expected with a solid growth outlook. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number 9. As Dave highlighted at the beginning of the call, we're midway through the year with strong results, near record backlog, and good visibility into the balance of the year. All in, we're confident in raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance for 2023. We're raising our full year organic revenue growth guidance to approximately 8%, up from our prior guidance range of 7% to 8%, reflecting strong results in the first half and improving visibility into the balance of the year across the portfolio. Including M&A, reported revenues are expected to be up approximately 10%. We're raising and tightening our EPS guidance to a range of $8.80 to $8.90, up from a range of $8.30 to $8.50, or up $0.45 at the midpoint. Our new adjusted EPS guidance indicates earnings growth of 20% to 21% in 2023. Importantly, we continue to expect to generate powerful free cash flow of equal to or greater than 100% of adjusted net earnings, or approximately $2 billion. We're raising our organic leverage guidance to 30% plus, up from 25% plus, as we expect the strength we've delivered in the first half of the year to continue in the second half. We also believe, it's constructive to give you some color around our expectations for the third quarter to assist with your modeling. We expect organic revenues of approximately 7% in the third quarter, with strong 30% plus organic leverage. We also expect approximately three points of M&A in the third and fourth quarters. We closed on two acquisitions in the second quarter, so our expected M&A contribution in the third and fourth quarters is a bit higher than it is for the first half and for the full year. Please see Slide 18 for additional information that may assist with your models. Please go to Slide number 10. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023. Importantly, we continue to invest these cost savings and high ROI projects to further fuel innovation, growth, and productivity. Our continuous improvement mindset is an integral part of our business operating system, and it's designed to drive gross productivity each year to offset other inflation. While it's been difficult to realize meaningful levels of productivity in recent years, given the supply chain and other macro challenges, productivity has been improving as supply chains recover. This is reflected in our strong first half results and our updated 2023 organic leverage target of 30% plus. Please go to Slide number 11. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest return for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as stock trades below are calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide number 12, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment for 2023. Year-to-date, we've deployed $1.2 billion in cash, with $341 million to dividends, $535 million to M&A, and $300 million to share repurchases. We have $2.9 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization and our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we have deployed $535 million year-to-date for bolt-on leading technology acquisitions and equity investments. During Q2, we acquired a leading industrial process cooling technology company in EMEA and a precision temperature-controlled cooling company in the life sciences vertical in the Americas. All in, we're on track to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash in 2023. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please go to Slide number 14. Today, I'll take just a minute to provide an update on the transport refrigeration markets as we know this is a topic of interest for investors. The key takeaway is that while there has been a modest movement in the ACT North America forecast from flattish to down low single-digits for 2023, we're not seeing material changes that would impact our full year outlook, given our strong backlog and bookings expectations. Overall, we expect our Thermo King business in the Americas to be up low to mid single-digits in 2023, which reflects several points of market outgrowth. Our EMEA Thermo King outlook is also unchanged. The overall EMEA transport refrigeration market is expected to be down low to mid single-digits. We expect to outperform end markets and to be roughly flat for 2023. In both segments, we are on pace to achieve these targets. Please go to Slide number 15. ACT continues to provide long-term forecast for refrigerated trailers, and they are projecting strong demand through 2028 after low single-digit dips in 2023 and 2024. The data supports the view we've been highlighting for some time now that this is a strong mid-40,000 unit market, plus or minus a few percentage points. Please go to Slide number 16. In summary, we are positioned to outperform over the long term. We are proud to have recently been recognized by Fast Company as one of the best workplaces for innovators and also certified as a Great Place To Work for the third consecutive year. It's our culture and our people that fuel our innovation and fulfill on our purpose each and every day. Our strong second quarter performance, resilient portfolio and tremendous backlog gives us confidence in again raising our full year revenues and EPS guidance and reaffirming our full year free cash flow conversion guidance. We believe we have the right strategy, the best team and a solid foundation in place to deliver strong performance in 2023 and differentiated long-term shareholder returns. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. A \u2013 Dave Regnery : Hey, Andy. How are you doing? A \u2013 Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Everyone. Dave Regnery : Hi, Andy. How are you doing? Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Good. How are you? So Dave or Chris, you delivered 30% leverage in Q2, expecting 30% for the year, which obviously is above your usual 25% plus guide. The biggest reason that you're getting -- is it that you're getting more than 20 basis points to 30 basis points of price versus costs in the quarter and for the year? And you mentioned higher-than-usual investments this year as well as accelerating productivity. So could 30% really be the new 25% potentially as you go into 2024 over the longer terms in terms of incremental margin? Chris Kuehn : Andy, it's Chris. Thanks for the question. Look, we're proud where we delivered 30% organic leverage through the first half of the year, and it's giving us a lot of confidence to be 30% or greater in 2023. Look, we're leveraging all parts of the P&L. Price/cost is coming in better than expected. We typically target 20 basis points to 30 basis points of price/cost spread. We're going to do better than that this year. We are seeing a recovery at the supply chain. It is driving improved productivity, less inefficiencies in our plants. And with that higher volume growth with a fewer inefficiencies, we're really getting some nice strong incrementals. What we're really seeing is a dovetail here between price/cost contribution, which will normalize in the second half of the year. We're seeing productivity improving with that improved supply chain and ultimately, like I said, driving those higher volumes. We're continuing to invest incrementally. We're still targeting 60 basis points to 70 basis points of incremental investment, call it, 30 basis points to 40 basis points above normal, and we really like that formula. So really, it's all parts of the P&L that are working and giving us confidence on the 30%-plus, Andy, for this year. On your question longer term, we do like the model at 25%-plus organic leverage into the future. We like that optionality that it gives us to keep reinvesting into the business. But as we go into each and every year, we'll kind of call it do like that long-term target. Andy Kaplowitz : Well, I tried, Chris. Thanks for that. And then, Dave, can you give us more color into how you're thinking about commercial HVAC markets in the Americas? You talked about good three-year stack. We know there are tough comps. Maybe you could give us your thoughts on book-to-bill going forward there. Are there any markets that you would term as slowing? And then you kept the $6 billion overall minimum backlog for the company. With two quarters behind you, would you say the chances are higher that you'd end the year closer to $7 billion than $6 billion? Any thoughts around that minimum? Dave Regnery : Okay. That's a long question, Andy. I'll try to remember it all. But as we said, I think it's going to be $6 billion -- north of $6 billion for the year, I'll start there. Look, I'm proud of what the team has been able to deliver. If you look at the revenue growth for commercial HVAC in the second quarter, it was high-teens. And despite that high revenue growth, our book-to-bill was approximately 100%. So you could just see the absolute bookings numbers are just very, very strong. If you look at where the strength is coming from, it's really broad-based across several verticals, so think of data centers, think of high tech, think of healthcare, think of ESSER funding in the education vertical, all really driving a lot of growth for us in our commercial HVAC business, and that team continues to execute at a very, very high level. Now you're seeing -- we're starting to see some of the megaprojects now really come in. And our team is just doing a great job of triaging how we call on those customers. This is where a direct sales force, Andy, I know you and I have talked about this before, it's really a competitive advantage and it's a global direct sales force. We recently were working with a customer in Texas on a semiconductor plant. And just to give you some of the complexity, these are complex projects, but here's a project where the owner was located in South Korea. The engineer was located in Portland, Oregon. The general contractor was also out of South Korea. The mechanical was located in Texas. And here, our team triages has direct contact with all of those influencers and really allows us to create a differentiated value proposition for the customers. So short answer is we continue to see lots of nice growth. Andy Kaplowitz : Very helpful, Dave. Thanks. Dave Regnery : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. So it sounds like slightly better, perhaps, commercial HVAC sales outlook, unchanged in transport largely, and then resi HVAC may be slightly worse. So, just wanted to sort of ask you on that last piece. Is the right way to think about that, that you had sort of volumes down high-teens in the second quarter, that narrows in Q3 and then you're sort of flat to modestly down in the fourth quarter? Is that the way to think about that resi market? And any thoughts on the sort of inventory levels sitting out there for you? Dave Regnery : Hey, Julian, this is Dave. I'll start. Look, I think I'll go back to a year ago, okay? And the second quarter of 2022, our revenue growth in the resi business was 30%. I don't remember the exact market number but I believe it was up in the teens. So we had a lot of growth there in the second quarter. Obviously, the second quarter of this year, we're down in the mid-teens. If you look at it on a two-year comp, you'd say we're still up in the mid-teens. So as far as inventory goes in the channel, look, we're normalizing in 2023 in our res business. And it's -- we think that normalization process is going to continue in the back half of the year. We're calling residential to be down high single digits on an EBIT basis for the year. We think the third quarter will be better than the second quarter, but there's still going to be some normalization that has to occur in that business. If you look a little bit forward into 2024, we think the normalization process, at least from an inventory standpoint, will be behind us in 2023. A little early to call what 2024 will be. However, we do expect some tailwinds coming in from policy, specifically around IRA. Don't -- can't size that yet because the rules are still a little unclear on IRA, but we do believe it will be a tailwind for our businesses in both the residential and in commercial. Chris, anything you want to add? Chris Kuehn : Going back to Q2, Q3 last year, I think we felt like we led in price over 2021 and 2022, so that is a part of the reason in the tough comp. And to Dave's guidance on the full year, revenue is down mid-single digits, units down high singles. We've built into our guide plus or minus revenues down mid-singles. We feel like that's part of our guidance that we've updated here on top line revenue growth and our earnings per share. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. And then just my second question on the backlog outlook, maybe to ask it a slightly different way from the prior question. But pre-COVID, I think the backlog to sales coverage was 20%. Last 18 months, it's run at sort of 40%-plus. So with the sort of the broad idea here that, that coverage shrinks slowly but surely but ends up at a place well above where you were pre-COVID. Is that how we should sort of think about the backlog? And so your commercial HVAC orders, therefore, don't see a big drop from current levels? Chris Kuehn : Hey Julian, this is Chris, I'll start. I think about the backlog at the end of December to now at the end of the second quarter, backlog is up about $100 million, but you're seeing residential execute foods normalization, Thermo King executing through its backlog and actually commercial HVAC is up from even six months ago. So we just continue to see very strong strength there. Our view is we're going to be greater than $6 billion going into the end of 2023. It's going to set us up very well for healthy revenue growth in 2024. And I think, it will continue to be a high-grade problem, we're going to have for a little bit of time to come. The backlog will normalize over time. We're just not seeing very much of that happening this year. In Dave's comments, $2 billion of the current backlog here at the end of the second quarter is already built for 2024. And that's five times the normal level we'd have here at the end of the second quarter. So, we're getting a lot of visibility into next year already. And as you mentioned, a normal percentage of the next 12 months of revenue in backlog is 20%. Dave won\u2019t let me commit to $30 billion of revenue next year. We end the year at $6 billion of backlog. But it will normalize to your point, Julian. It's just going to take some time, but we're still seeing some very strong strength in commercial HVAC right now. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Julian. Dave Regnery : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Josh Pokrzywinski : Hi, good morning, guys. Chris Kuehn : Hey Josh, how are you doing? Dave Regnery : Good morning. Josh Pokrzywinski : Dave, you mentioned ESSER and IRA a couple of times. IRA specifically having a hard time quantifying just yet. But maybe thinking about how those two maybe intersect and then diverge. Where are we in sort of the total ESSER spending, whether it's orders or shipments? And then, do you feel like IRA will be similar sized, larger, smaller? Any way you can kind of dimensionalize those two things as we're maybe maturing in one and entering the other. Dave Regnery : Yes. We'll start with ESSER. I think if you look at it from a revenue standpoint, I'd say it's middle innings. If you look at it from an order standpoint, it's obviously a little bit ahead of that because we have orders in our backlog for this. Our team has just done a great job there working with school systems across the country and really helping them help them increase the ability for them to have a safe environment for the children that are learning there. And it really started -- I think you heard me say this before, I started when we were doing indoor air qualities. We created road maps, and we're really executing to that. So revenue standpoint, think of it mid-single digits. IRA, it's all in front of us, okay? It's going to be a 2024 tailwind, very difficult to size right now because, it's going to be each state may have a different set of standards, and we're trying to understand all those different standards now. It will be a tailwind. We're just trying to size it. With the breadth of our portfolio, regardless of how the final rules are written, we'll have a product that will be part of a solution for a customer and I know we tend to want to think of IRA in the residential space, and it will certainly be a tailwind there. It's also going to be a tailwind for our commercial business. And so we're working both fronts of it and stay tuned. And as we learn more, we'll tell others. Q \u2013 Josh Pokrzywinski : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just on the backlog. If I recall correctly, you guys don't count service in that reported backlog number. If that's correct, maybe give us some context for how service backlogs look if you had to parse them out that way. And how much kind of extra visibility you have on that front? A \u2013 Dave Regnery : You're correct. It doesn't provide any service. We don't include that in our backlog. Difficult to say. Services -- first of all, our service business is a great business, okay? It was up again high single-digits in the second quarter. Chris, I think we're now -- I think I could say six years now where we have compound annual growth rate of high single-digits across the globe, okay? So this is a very strong business that's key to our strategy and really allows us to be tethered to our customers for the life our products. We don't -- it's difficult to ascertain a backlog because if you start thinking of multiyear service agreements, it'd just really be difficult to say if it's a three-year service agreement. A lot of times, we like to add things to service agreements so it'd be hard to quantify that number. Q \u2013 Josh Pokrzywinski : Understood. Appreciate the detail. A \u2013 Dave Regnery : Thanks, Josh. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Chris Snyder : Thank you. Obviously, a lot of focus on orders. And what I wanted to follow-up on the prior commentary around the US megaprojects that we're seeing. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about how these projects flow into orders for Trane and then ultimately, revenue for Trane just to kind of get a sense for what that lag could be? Thank you. A \u2013 Dave Regnery : Yeah. Chris, good question. We are very -- one of our operating system is a very detailed process that we follow. So when we start all the way in the planning phase, we then move to permitting, we then go to engineering, we then go to groundbreaking and site prep and through construction. So it's a very detailed approach you need to follow and the earlier you're involved, the more value you're going to create for the customer. As far as the timing on these, it depends on the type of project, okay? If it's a semiconductor plant, that process could take 3.5, 4 years from planning all the way through completion. Think about HVAC equipment probably being installed and operating maybe 9 to 12 months before operation of the facility. So you can start to back that up as to when you start to see orders. That could be -- it's a bit different on a battery plant, a little bit shorter duration. But again, it's really being involved early in the planning phase and then all through the process. And again, these are very complex projects. So you often have influencers in different parts of the globe that you need to have relationships with and be able to call on. Q \u2013 Chris Snyder : Thank you. Appreciate that. And if I could follow-up on data center, another big focus in the market right now. I mean, it's a vertical that the company has always done well in. Can you maybe talk about how activity is trending here? Is the business seeing any impact from AI investment into data centers? Is that still on the horizon? Any color or outlook there would be helpful. Thank you. A \u2013 Dave Regnery : Yeah, Chris. Well, thanks for the question, Chris. Yeah, it is a vertical that we've been strong in for a long time, okay? And the answer on AI and the new GPU chip that's now going to be used with AR predominantly with AI, that's a graphic process unit. These units produce a lot more heat. So think of a conventional CPU or central processing unit versus a GPU, graphics process unit. The graphics process unit throws off about 3x the amount of heat versus what we've seen in the past. So if you take that and you think about a data center, the cooling loads within data centers are going to have to change. And we're working with a lot of data center customers because we have a lot of really neat solutions around these high heat applications. So it's definitely going to have an impact on the data centers of tomorrow, how they're being constructed, how they're being planned. And I would tell you that our teams are working very closely with our customers and developing really creative solutions. Q \u2013 Chris Snyder : Thank you. Appreciate that. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Hey. Good morning, guys. Christopher Kuehn : Hey, Joe. Good morning. Joe Ritchie : Hey, Chris. I know that you don't want to give, I guess, maybe too many details on just price/cost but following up on Andy's question from earlier. I'm just curious like the benefit that you got in 2Q, are you expecting that benefit to be fairly consistent through the remainder of the year, or is it kind of like the biggest benefit you'll see in 2023? And then as you kind of think about the transformational cost out beyond this year, I'm just curious like what's in store beyond 2023. Christopher Kuehn : Yes, Joe, we did see price of around 5 points in the second quarter. We do expect that to moderate into the second half of the year. If I think about Q3 and Q4 of 2022, we delivered over 10 points of price in the second half of last year so we do expect that to moderate. As I think about the full year, our 8% organic revenue growth guide, we still see a bias towards a little bit more volume growth and price. So that price contribution will moderate, still be above the normal levels, let's say, of price pre-pandemic and pre this inflation. But this is where that dovetail with productivity, I think, is another way for us to fully leverage the P&L. As the supply chain continues to get better, we had 6 points of volume growth in the quarter, and we're expecting strong volumes in the second half. We're seeing better productivity in the plants. And to your second question, there's a lot of lost productivity for us to recapture over the last couple of years with these supply chain constraints. That, I think, is the next layer of opportunity for the company is we're A, well on track to deliver the $300 million of savings from transformation, and then B, we're always looking to make improvements in our business, leverage our business operating system to drive efficiencies and offset other inflation and productivity. But there's a productivity recapture here that I think is a tailwind for the company and gives us confidence that a 25% or greater organic leverage target is something we can achieve over time. Joe Ritchie : Yes. That makes a lot of sense. It's great to hear, Chris. Maybe 1 quick follow-up for Dave. I'm curious, this is a much broader question around the labor markets and then kind of the tightness we've seen over the last couple of years. I'm just curious, how is that kind of impacting some of the projects actually getting completed and whether it's actually elongating the time lines of some of these projects. I know that you mentioned earlier that we're probably halfway through the ESSER funding coming through in the P&L. But I'm just curious, like what are you seeing in terms of construction projects and labor tightness today? Dave Regnery : Yeah. I'll answer the question two ways, Joe. One is from a -- on the commercial side so construction projects, we've seen some delays but nothing that I would call. I think those were -- those have improved from what we've seen in the past. I wouldn't say that's something that's -- we're seeing some projects push but not a lot. So that's not a major problem. I think from an internal source of our direct labor, we've done a lot of work with developing programs to really apprenticeship programs to really grow talent and to give opportunities to people to learn new skills. We've done a lot with tuition advancement programs so that we could deliver, at a grassroots level, the talent not only for today but also for the future. We've had a lot of success with that. I was out in La Crosse, Wisconsin a couple of weeks ago, and it was just refreshing to see the apprenticeship labs we have out there and teaching individuals that were not experts in welding become experts in welding. And it's a great job. It's a great living that these individuals can have with Trane Technologies and there's great advancement. So overall, we're okay. Joe Ritchie : Sounds good. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hi. Good morning. Dave Regnery : Hey, Steve, how you doing? Good morning. Steve Tusa : Not too bad. Can you just give the split between light commercial and applied in that equipment number, sales number or bookings, either one? Dave Regnery : Yeah. In the Americas, our revenue was very strong in equipment. It was up over 30%. Applied was a bit stronger than unitary, but both were strong. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. And then just on resi. The guidance this year, so I think your units are down like low double so far first half maybe, something like that. It's hard to tell how much price you're getting there. You're guiding for, I guess, for the year, a high single-digit decline. Is that just the comps in the second half? And then maybe just some color on what you guys are seeing so far with the hot weather here in July. Dave Regnery : Yeah, Steve, it's a bit of all of that. I think sequential improvement we're expecting from Q2 to Q3, the delayed start to the cooling season that's fully in force at this point so we see that sequential improvement into the second half. The comps get a little bit easier as you go into the second half of the year. As Dave mentioned 30% growth in Q2 a year ago, it was mid-teens growth in Q3 and then flattish in Q4. So we just see a little bit easier comps in the second half of the year for resi than where they were in the first half of 2022, but have a lot of confidence that we think we were calling the units down high single digits for the year. Revenue is down probably around mid-singles. And again, plus or minus, we've got that in our guide for the full year outlook. Steve Tusa : And is there any difference between the sell-in and sell-through, your independent distribution versus your captive in the quarter? Dave Regnery : Yes, a bit, like our revenue was down in the mid-teens. Our sell-through was down in the mid-single digits. So the inventory adjustment happened in the second quarter, Steve. We just think more of it will happen in the third quarter as well. Steve Tusa : Yep. Make some sense. All right. Thanks, guys. Dave Regnery : Yeah. Chris Kuehn : Yeah. Steve, one more thing on price. Just I think you were trying to dial in price in the first half. We're not getting the strong levels of prices you may think we're getting in the first half. It is less than 5% for the first half, and it's going to get lower in the second half for resi. That's just really a strong, very strong comp against where we led with price in 2021 and 2022. We're just seeing that normalize here in the business. So hopefully, that helps clarify a couple of things. Q \u2013 Steve Tusa : Yeah, great. Thanks. A \u2013 Dave Regnery : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks. Good morning all. A \u2013 Dave Regnery : Hey, Jeff. How are you doing? Q \u2013 Jeff Sprague : I am doing really well. Thanks. Hope you are too. Dave, I wonder if you could just give us your thoughts on the refrigerant transition in 2025 for resi and whether that does, in fact, cause any sort of pre-buy or channel distortions in 2024? A \u2013 Dave Regnery : Yeah. I mean, there is a refrigerant change that will happen in 2025 moving away from 410. Look, we're ready for it, I'll start with the engineering side of it. We're ready for it. We've been -- we've worked with next-generation refrigerants for a while so this is right up our alley and the team has done a great job preparing us. We're also preparing our manufacturing locations as we speak to be ready for it. The new refrigerant is classified as slightly flammable, so you have different procedures as to how you handle the refrigerant. But we'll be ready for it. We're not concerned about that. As far as the pre-buy goes, Jeff, the product is going to be more expensive, yes, because it's a -- what they call A2L refrigerant, slightly flammable. You will have additional sensors on the equipment so the cost will be higher. But there's also going to be a limit on the sell-through. So if you had a -- if you were trying to create a pre-buy, you'd have to sell through that inventory. The way it's written right now is within 12 months or it would be stranded inventory. So I do not anticipate that we're going to see a large pre-buy at this time. We'll see how it plays out. Q \u2013 Jeff Sprague : All right. Great, understand. And then it looks and feels like M&A is picking up a little bit, select kind of technology bolt-ons and the like. Is that the playbook going forward? Do you see the prospect for larger things? Are there larger things in the pipeline, whether or not they may be actionable or not? A \u2013 Dave Regnery : Yeah. I mean, as you could imagine, being a global HVAC player, we get to see a lot of different opportunities. We like these technology acquisitions. We've been very successful with them. We acquired MTA, great industrial process cooling technology. We'll be able to scale that predominantly in Europe. We'll be able to scale it in our channels. We also acquired Helmer in the second quarter. Think of that in the life science space. Think about it as at the storage capability but also in the processing capability. So again, a nice acquisition that we'll be able to scale with our channels. We like this technology. We've been very good at taking these technology companies with great products and bolting them on to our operations. And with our strong channel, we've been able to create a lot of value for our shareholders. Q \u2013 Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you. A \u2013 Dave Regnery : Sure, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Nigel Coe : Hi. Thanks, good morning. Thanks for the question. So want to go back to margins. A \u2013 Dave Regnery : Hi, Nigel. Q \u2013 Nigel Coe : Hi, David. I want to go back to margins, obviously the improving organic incrementals. So I'm hearing better productivity at the factory. Obviously, price/cost is a nice tailwind. So I'm just curious, how do margins and backlog look generally compared to what we're converting now? Do we have better backlog margins to come through over the next year or so? And then on the investment spending, I think we had a slight back-end loading on the investor spending this year. Is there anything on the timing of investments that we need to factor into our models? Chris Kuehn : Hey Nigel, it's Chris. I'll start. We've been happy with the margins in backlog. Obviously, our backlog is more focused on equipment than it is service, but we're happy with the margins in the backlog, gives us confidence on the 30%-plus leverage for the year. We're just starting to build some backlog for 2024, so we'll comment more on that as we get to guiding for 2024. But the team's just done an outstanding job for several years now, making sure that we're embedding inflation and expectations around that and making sure that we're getting price. And it's a lot easier. As Dave reminds me all the time, it's a lot easier to get price and you've got innovative products out there and you're talking to the customer about an improved solution from what they previously have. All that is reflected in our higher organic leverage guide for the year. And we'll kind of update as we go through the end of this year getting ready for 2024. On the investments, yes, we're still targeting, call it, 70 basis points of incremental investment. Think of this as investments in our electrification portfolio across our product lines and electrifying the portfolio, investments in the digital strategy, the connectedness back to customers, the previous question on AI. We have over 36,000 connected buildings, over 1 million pieces of connected assets. This is an area that we're continuing to invest in, and we're really pleased with that progress in investment so far this year. Third area of investments for us would be around automation and investing in our own factories. This is starting to see some early results with better productivity as well. So the pipeline is strong on the investments. We're continuing to make sure we can accelerate and where we can, and it just gives us a lot of encouragement that's going to drive results in the future. Dave Regnery : Yes. And that's all baked into our guide, Nigel. And if you look at the midpoint of our EPS guide for the year, will be above 20% EPS growth for the third year in a row. So I mean, I'm super proud of what the team has been able to accomplish there. And it's the flywheel of innovation. It's the flywheel around how we operate our business operating system. I always tell people it's a system of things that makes Trane Technologies as a great company, and hopefully, investors see how we're executing to that system of things. Nigel Coe : No question. So base points, I think you mentioned in 1Q that, that was a bit lighter than the base points. I just wondered to see, if maybe on timing as well. But my follow-up question is maybe a bit piece, but the -- most of your industrial peers have gone to cash EPS. And I think you're carrying about $150 million of intangibles right now. I think it's about $0.50 per share or thereabouts. It's a chunk of change for sure. Have you considered maybe moving to cash EPS, especially as you do in these bolt-ons, which do tend to carry a lot more -- fair amount of intangibles? But have you considered that move? And if not, would you consider that if you were to do more deals? Chris Kuehn : Nigel, appreciate the suggestion. We'll look into it. We like the simple methodology of looking at just net earnings and how much free cash flow are we driving off of that. When I think about our conversion in the last three years, the average free cash flow conversion and earnings for us is 110%. And we're targeting this year equal to or greater than 100% on conversion. So we do look at that metric. When it comes to return on invested capital, we look at cash flow return on invested capital as another metric. I think it takes out the noise a bit of some of the accounting conventions that we have to manage through and ultimately, on an ex-intangible basis, let's look at the cash returns of those investments. And we'll start that with an acquisition really year 1, year 2, year 3 and evaluate its accretiveness over a period of time. So we like the ability to by the third year of an acquisition, have accretive EPS growth, drive accretive cash flow return on invested capital. And I would say while very modest this year, even the acquisitions we just made this year will have a very modest impact on EPS already in year 1. So I think that's a bit of the metric, but I appreciate the insight. We'll certainly give that some thought. Q \u2013 Nigel Coe : Fair enough. Cash is king. Thanks, guys. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Nigel. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, can we put the spotlight on China? For a moment here, it was really a standout. And whereas a lot of the other industrials have struggled in terms of COVID reopening and so forth, how much of that was a catch up? Just kind of give us a perspective on what the cadence of orders are and what you're expecting in the second half? A \u2013 David Regnery : Yes. I mean we did have an easy comp in the second quarter in Asia Pacific, specifically in China because of COVID lockdowns. Think about, I think it's like $60 million that pushed out of the second quarter into the back half of the year. But even with that, we had very strong results in China. And if you look specifically in China, I mean, the verticals that are strong, we're strong in. So think of the high-tech vertical, semiconductors, data centers, health care, those are all -- with a direct sales force, again, we're very strong in those verticals. And the team there has just executed at a very high level. We have a very strong team in Asia Pacific and we continue to do very, very well in that region of the world. Deane Dray : That's great. If we just -- data centers come up multiple times. AI has come up multiple times. We get that. And in your answer to Chris' question about the implications of AI and the whole 3x heat factor with the new chips. The legacy cooling for data centers will still be in demand. But more investment is happening on the liquid cooling side. Have you -- and maybe you teased us a bit with say you've got some other projects that you're working on. So maybe there's some liquid cooling opportunities there. But how do you see, as a legacy air cooling business, how do you see the rise of liquid cooling? Is this a threat? Is this a business that you need to get into? Just share us sort of what you think the road map is. A \u2013 David Regnery : Great. Great question, Dean. You obviously did your homework in this space. We made an equity investment in a company called Liquid Stack at the end of the first quarter, and they specialize in emerging cooling. And think about emerging cooling is, you're actually putting the rack into what they call a dielectric fluid. And all that means is it doesn't conduct electricity. These are very efficient systems. So we have our scientists working with Liquid Stack scientists, and we actually have some data center customers that are involved in this as well as we really triage this opportunity. Early days is -- this has a lot of promise. And we're excited about it. I think when you get into these high heat applications, this is where a new technology will be developed. And we're going to keep working it. We're not there yet but we think it has a lot of opportunities for the future. Deane Dray : Yeah, we agree. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Sure. Nice question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hi, guys. Good morning. Dave Regnery : Hey, Andrew, how are you doing? Andrew Obin : I'm doing well. Just a question trying to size another opportunity. Obviously, these big megaprojects, EVs and semiconductors, what's the right way of sizing it per project as a percent of sales? I mean, I've heard a number, I think, 100,000 ton chiller fab plant. You guys brought up, I take it, at Long in Texas. Is that sort of the right size of thinking per facility? Thank you. Dave Regnery : I mean, it's a good question, Andrew. The short answer is it depends, okay? You have some fab plants that are extensions. You have other fab plants that are new. The EV battery plant could be really all over the map as far as the size that they'll be putting in. So I hate to give out a number because averages will always -- I know you're trying to size the total opportunity. I would just tell you it's large. And it's large on both the chilled water side as well as on the air handling side. So if you think about it as an applied system, this is a large opportunity. It will be a tailwind for our business into the future. Andrew Obin : And just maybe shifting a little bit to light commercial. Can we just talk about what has been driving the strength in light commercial? And anything that sort of concerns you about maybe channel inventory in light commercial, just comps getting tough, or frankly, you talked about not seeing any impact from IRA into 2024, if that just runs everything and we should just take a longer-term view. But just more color on light commercial units? Thank you. Dave Regnery : I don't think there's anything I would call out. I think there was an efficiency change. You knew about that. So certainly, there could have been some pent-up demand. It's not a product that we have a lot of inventory on. Some of it goes through our IWDs on the very light side, but not where -- that's not where the -- when we talk about our residential business, we talk about normalizing, that's not where the normalization has to occur. So it's been strong. We've been strong for a while. And obviously, we have a very competitive portfolio there with some really neat innovations. I think I told you when we were together that we took the opportunity, when we had the efficiency change, to really refresh the portfolio. Now, all of our light unitary product can be offered in what we call a dual fuel option. So think of it as a heat pump that could also operate with fossil fuel based on what ambient temperatures are in a particular region at a particular time. So, variable customers. So it's -- we're super excited about the opportunities there. Andrew Obin : Got you. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back to Zac Nagle for closing comments. Zac Nagle : Thank you. I'd like to thank everyone for joining in today's call. Thanks for your interest and time spent with Trane Technologies. We'll be at a variety of investor events in the fall, and we hope to see many of you there. We'll chat soon. Thanks.

David Regnery : Thanks, Zac and everyone, for joining us on today's call. I'd like to begin with a few comments on our purpose : to boldly challenge what's possible for a sustainable world. Our purpose is at the heart of our strategy, which is aligned to powerful mega trends like energy efficiency, decarbonization and digital transformation. Coming off the hottest summer on record, we see policies aimed at decarbonizing the built environment continuing to expand. We see growing sustainability commitments for our customers, our suppliers and for our investors. We see corporations not only setting goals but taking action. We are their partner of choice. And we have the technology to help bend the curve on climate change, and that's exactly what we're doing. We are scaling today's technology and relentlessly innovating for tomorrow to meet our customers' needs to dramatically reduce emissions. This enables us to consistently outgrow our end markets and deliver differentiated financial results. The end result is long-term value creation for our customers, our shareholders, our employees and for the planet. Moving to Slide #4. Our global team performed extremely well in the third quarter, setting us up for a strong 2023 and positioning us well for 2024. We delivered strong organic growth of 9% and leverage throughout the P&L, resulting in adjusted EPS growth of 23% and powerful free cash flow. We continue to see very strong customer demand for our products and services, with the enterprise bookings at an all-time high of nearly $5 billion in the quarter. Bookings were exceptionally strong in our commercial HVAC businesses globally, with organic bookings growth of low to mid-teens in all segments. Our Americas commercial HVAC business was once again a standup with organic bookings up mid-teens in the quarter and up approximately 65% on a 3-year stack. Enterprise backlog ended the quarter at $6.9 billion, with the composition shifting increasingly towards commercial HVAC. Year-to-date, backlog in commercial HVAC is up approximately $800 million. Over the past 3 years, our commercial HVAC backlog has nearly tripled, up approximately 170%. As residential and Thermo King have normalized, the backlog burn in these businesses has been completely offset by growth in commercial HVAC backlog, including a large percentage of long-cycle applied systems. We continue to drive strong demand and a healthy pipeline of projects in key growth verticals across our commercial HVAC businesses. We're leveraging the power of our direct sales force, which brings specific expertise on how to customize solutions and leverage policy, programs and incentives to optimize customers' paybacks, total cost of ownership and performance. Our leading innovation and unique direct go-to-market strategy enables us to quickly pivot and win in the highest growth verticals as markets evolve. We have a resilient and diverse portfolio, and our business operating system is designed to deliver consistent top quartile performance. As our residential business has normalized and transport markets have softened, our overall business has delivered strong results and is on track to deliver high single-digit organic revenue growth and 20%-plus adjusted EPS growth for the year, our third consecutive year of 20% or higher adjusted EPS growth. We're on pace to deliver free cash flow equal to or greater than 100% of net earnings and continue to execute our balanced capital allocation strategy with high levels of business reinvestment, a strong and growing dividend, strategic bolt-on M&A and share repurchases. Our strong execution, robust bookings and revenue growth and exceptional backlog gives us confidence in raising our 2023 guidance and confidence in our ability to deliver strong performance in 2024 as well. Please go to Slide #5. Demand for our innovative products and services continues to be broad-based across our segments, highlighting the strength of our global portfolio. Organic bookings were up 8%, led by our commercial HVAC businesses. In the Americas, commercial HVAC was very strong across the board. We discussed booking strength on the prior slide but revenues were exceptional as well, up in the low 20s percent range with equipment up approximately 30% and services up low teens. Our residential business continues to normalize as expected with revenues up low single digit. Consistent with our prior comments, the nature of our transport refrigeration business is lumpy, and our performance in Q3 was in line with our expectations on both bookings and revenues. Revenues were a bit lower than our guidance of down 10%, driven by the timing of customer deliveries between Q2 and Q3 but remained strong against a tough 60% prior year growth comp. On a 2-year stack, revenues were up more than 40% in the quarter. Americas backlog is approximately 3x historical norms with the largest component being commercial HVAC applied systems for 2024 and beyond. Applied systems are the most complex and innovative systems and the largest driver of our service business in commercial HVAC. Our EMEA business was right on track with our expectations. Bookings were strong in both businesses, both up low teens. Commercial HVAC revenues were robust with mid-single-digit growth on tough prior year comps. TK EMEA revenues were up versus a down market. Backlog remains strong, approximately 60% higher than historical norms and predominantly commercial HVAC. Our Asia Pacific business performed well with strong bookings growth in China and the rest of Asia. Asia revenues were slightly lower against a tough prior year comp of nearly 30% growth. Our outlook for the region continues to be positive. The verticals we play in remain strong with good opportunities for future growth. Asia segment backlog continues to be robust as we approach 2024, approximately 70% above historical norms and predominantly commercial HVAC. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Christopher Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #6. The scoreboard for the quarter highlights strong execution top to bottom. Organic revenues were up 9%, adjusted operating and EBITDA margins were up 130 basis points and 100 basis points, respectively, and adjusted EPS was up 23%. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up high single digits and low teens, respectively. We continue to highlight our exceptional services growth because our services business continues to differentiate us in our industry. It makes Trane Technologies more resilient with higher recurring revenues at higher margins over time and represents about 1/3 of our enterprise revenues. Over the past 6 years, including 2020, our services business delivered a revenue growth CAGR of up high single digits, and we're driving even stronger growth in 2023. Our high-performance flywheel continues to deliver results with relentless investment in innovation driving strong top line growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. Please turn to Slide #7. As an enterprise, we delivered about 5 points of volume and about 4 points of price in the quarter. Strong volume growth, positive price realization and productivity combined to more than offset inflation in the quarter. The supply chain continues to stabilize, enabling improving productivity as we move throughout the year. In the Americas segment, we delivered about 7 points of volume and 4 points of price that accompanied strong leverage and margin expansion led by our commercial HVAC business, more than offsetting volume declines in transport. The EMEA segment delivered very strong organic incrementals and margin expansion, with organic revenues up low single digits in the quarter. The segment also delivered approximately 12 points of M&A growth in the quarter, which impacted reported leverage, given year 1 integration costs. The Asia segment delivered strong margin expansion and organic leverage in the quarter on slightly down revenues. For the enterprise, we earmarked an additional 30-plus basis points for incremental business reinvestment in 2023 to accelerate the timing of key projects across the enterprise. This nearly doubles our average run rate of approximately 40 basis points annually or a total of 70-plus basis points in 2023. We're extremely pleased we've been able to make these incremental investments in 2023 while driving strong leverage. We see a tight linkage between investments in innovation and market outgrowth, and we're taking opportunities to go further and faster in 2023. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide #8. Overall, our positive outlook for our segments and our end markets is largely unchanged from the prior quarter. And as we move into the fourth quarter with continued high levels of absolute demand, exceptional backlog and strong execution, we're gaining additional visibility into healthy growth in 2024. Across the enterprise, there are some key themes. Strong demand for our sustainability-focused solutions remains high. While we expect the law of large numbers to kick in at some point and for order growth to decline, absolute bookings are expected to remain robust, given our new baseline is at a very high level. Across our businesses, we see the stacking effect of supportive policy and regulatory changes that play to our unique strength as a leading climate innovator. In addition to all the tailwinds at a national level in both the U.S. and Europe, we see activity at the state and municipal levels, and our direct sales force is able to help customers leverage these programs. In Americas commercial HVAC, our business is extremely strong as we've outlined. We're winning with customers and developing innovative solutions in data centers, education and high tech, just to name a few strong verticals. And we're driving tremendous growth in our applied business, which makes up the majority of our backlog. Applied business is the most differentiated and complex and it's where our competitive advantages shine. It's long cycle with higher-margin service opportunities, representing a multiple of initial purchase price over the life of the system. Additionally, this business helps to forge long-term relationships with customers as they move from project to project over a multiyear period. We have the most comprehensive portfolio of products in the industry, which enables us to compete and win across all verticals, driving leading long-term sustainable growth. There's no change to our residential business outlook. We expect residential to continue to normalize through the fourth quarter and for the normalization process to be largely complete in 2023. Also, as expected, strength in commercial HVAC is more than offsetting the decline in residential in 2023. Our transport refrigeration business was largely in line with our expectations in the third quarter and up more than 40% on a 2-year stack. We expect to outperform the market for the year. ACT is projecting a dip in 2024 and a bounceback in 2025 and continued growth afterwards. However, ACT's forecast has been volatile in recent months, and we are in the process of validating assumptions versus our internal forecast and other sources. We'll update the market when we hold our year-end earnings call. In our EMEA segment, the third quarter was also in line with our expectations for both businesses. As we highlighted in our second quarter call, EMEA HVAC has very tough comps in both the third and fourth quarters, up high 20s and low 40s, respectively, and revenue growth is expected to be more moderate in the second half. The 2-year stack for Q3 is up more than 30%. Our transport refrigeration outlook is unchanged. Likewise, our Asia Pacific segment, our outlook for the full year is unchanged. Revenue in the second half is expected to be flattish, purely related to tough prior year comps while bookings continue to be strong. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris? Christopher Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #9. Strong execution, record bookings and near-record backlog puts us in an excellent position as we move into the fourth quarter. We're raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance for 2023. Organic revenue growth is expected to be between 8% and 9%, up from our prior guidance of up approximately 8%, reflecting strong Q3 performance and a largely unchanged outlook for a robust Q4. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $9, up from a range of $8.80 to $8.90, mainly reflecting a flow-through of our third quarter outperformance versus our guidance and continued strong leverage of 30%-plus for the fourth quarter. We're pleased with our free cash flow performance of approximately $1.3 billion year-to-date. And on the full year, we continue to expect to deliver powerful free cash flow of equal to or greater than adjusted net earnings or approximately $2 billion. As we've highlighted before, we pay close attention to our investment peer group and consistently target top quartile financial performance, including adjusted EPS growth and adjusted free cash flow conversion. We believe our guidance places us in a strong position to deliver against that target in 2023. As we said in our last earnings call, we expect an increased M&A contribution in the second half versus the first half due to the timing of acquisitions. We had approximately 3 points of M&A in the third quarter and expect to have approximately 2 points of M&A in the fourth quarter as 1 acquisition passes the 1-year mark and is included in our base. There is no change to our full year guidance of approximately 2 points from M&A. Please see Slide 19 of the presentation for additional details related to guidance to assist with your models. Please go to Slide #10. We remain on track to deliver $300 million of run rate savings from business transformation by 2023, including $60 million which will be realized in 2023. We continue to invest in these cost savings and high ROI projects to further fuel innovation and other investments across the portfolio. Our continuous improvement mindset is an integral part of our business operating system, and it's designed to drive gross productivity each year to offset other inflation. While it's been extremely difficult to realize meaningful levels of productivity in recent years, given the supply chain and other macro challenges, productivity is improving as supply chain challenges abate and is contributing to our 30%-plus organic leverage target in 2023. Please go to Slide #11. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. In 2023, we received upgrades to our credit ratings, which are now Baa1, BBB+, reflective of our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide #12, and I'll provide an update on our capital deployment for 2023. Year-to-date, as of the end of October, we've deployed $1.6 billion in cash with $513 million to dividends, $535 million to M&A and $550 million to share repurchases. We have significant dry powder with over $2.6 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, and our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we have deployed or committed approximately $900 million year-to-date as of the end of October to bolt-on leading technology acquisitions and equity investments. Our latest acquisition, Nuvolo, was announced in early October. Nuvolo will augment our energy services, enterprise management and digital capabilities in commercial HVAC. We expect the Nuvolo transaction to close in the fourth quarter. All in, we're on track to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash in 2023. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide #14. Transport refrigeration market forecasts for both North America and EMEA remain unchanged, and we expect to outperform each market in 2023. Our performance through the third quarter is on track to meet these expectations. The slide shows key data points on the markets and on Thermo King specifically to provide additional transparency and reference information. Please go to Slide #15. As discussed, ACT's projections for 2024 have been volatile, and we are focused on conducting a thorough analysis of the markets. In the interim, we've included ACT's most recent forecast for 2023 through 2028 for your reference. Please go to Slide #16. We expect to provide 2024 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. However, given increasing visibility, we believe it may be constructive to discuss key dynamics at play that give us confidence we'll see healthy growth in 2024. Our commercial HVAC businesses, which make up roughly 65% of our total revenues, are executing well in healthy markets, and the agility of our sales teams to quickly pivot focus to growing vertical markets is driving record bookings and backlog. Our applied backlog is a standout and provides a long higher-margin service tail that makes our business stronger and more resilient. Secular mega trends continue to support growth, and policy and regulatory stacking is amplifying these tailwinds with the majority of these programs still ahead of us. We expect to enter 2024 with our residential business largely through the normalization process and on path to our long-term target of GDP-plus growth. We continue to lead with innovation, which yields healthy pricing opportunities, and our business operating system is primed to stay ahead of inflationary pressures. The supply chain has vastly improved and pockets of remaining challenges continue to abate. Our culture is lean-based and we're excited about the productivity we can unlock as we move into 2024. We've also been heavily investing in productivity-enhancing projects such as factory automation, which we expect to unlock further value. ACT is forecasting a dip in North American trailer production in 2024, a snapback in 2025 and growth thereafter. While we're in the process of further assessing their forecast, our North America transport refrigeration business is approximately 10% of our total revenues. We expect to execute well, manage the business tightly, outperform the end markets and, if necessary, manage deleverage within gross margin rates. Lastly, while we don't talk about our service business a lot, we're quietly putting up double-digit growth in 2023 on top of a 6-year compound annual growth rate of high single-digit growth. Our service business is strong, resilient and poised for growth, and we continue to build out our energy services and digital capabilities and offerings, which represents a big current and even larger future opportunity. Please go to Slide #17. In summary, we are well positioned to drive significant value over time.

Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Scott Davis : I'm kind of getting sick of congratulating you on good quarters, but this is one of the better ones. David Regnery : Please keep it up. Scott Davis : You're making Lehigh proud, Dave. All good. Guys, when you think about the backlog that you have and the demand environment in commercial, is this the type of environment where you can really be selective on projects and kind of cherry pick the stuff that as really the margin, price margin structure that you want? Or are you still -- or is that not kind of how it works and you're just out there bidding on a wider array of stuff but just bidding at a higher price? I was just trying to get a sense of that interplay between project selectivity and really just the supply-demand imbalance that's out there right now. David Regnery : Yes, Scott, it's a good question. We have strong core business right now. And we spend a lot on innovation and we price our innovation to ensure that we get proper returns. So I would say it's leading more with innovation, and we're constantly looking for how we can improve our portfolio, how we can improve the efficiency of our products, how our products can use next-generation low-GWP refrigerant. That's all inclusive in our business operating system when it comes to innovation. And that's what's really leading our markets right now. And I would also tell you that having this, and I know I've told you this before, but this direct sales force and being able to educate them on new innovations real time and having them take those messages to the influencers on jobs is very, very important when you go to close especially some of these large applied jobs. Scott Davis : Yes, that's helpful color. I have to ask this question. You have a competitor who had a ransomware issue in the quarter. Did that help you guys as it related to bidding on things and such or was that a nonevent? David Regnery : It was not -- it was a nonevent so I hope everything is okay there, but it was a nonevent. Operator : Your next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays Capital. Julian Mitchell : I think, Dave, you emphasized a couple of times the strength in applied bookings and the difference versus light commercial because of the service element. So maybe just a follow-up on that point would be around sort of what's the rough split today of, say, the revenues in your commercial HVAC business between applied and light commercial? And just wondered when you're looking at the revenue outlook next 12 months, do you anticipate much of a difference in revenue trends of applied versus light commercial maybe because of stimulus impacts or the scale of the respective backlogs? Any sort of perspective around that, please. David Regnery : Yes. Julian, we don't look at just light. We look at units are in total so it would be light and large. And historically, it's been about 50-50 in our equipment business. But obviously, in the third quarter, we had very, very strong demand in our applied business. So think of data centers, high tech, education, we're very strong. We had solid performance in other verticals, too, like health care, life science, government, industrial. And then there were some weaker verticals as well. Think of traditional office, warehousing and retail and those weaker verticals where you tend to see more unitary than applied systems. Julian Mitchell : That's very helpful. And then just my follow-up. It's more of a sort of silly short-term one, but only 1 quarter left in the year. Your sales guide, I think your Q4 sort of construct on guidance is the same as it was back in July, and you just kind of flowed through the Q3 beat to your full year guide. But if I wanted to look at the Q4 for what that's worth, the revenue guide implies nearly, I think, sort of 8%, 9% sequential sales decline from Q3, which seems a bit heavier than normal. Is that just kind of noise around backing out from the year? Or is there anything specific maybe in transport or something like that, that's weighing on Q4? Christopher Kuehn : Julian, it's Chris. I'll start off. The Q4 implied guide is kind of around mid-single digits organic revenue growth, and it is a little bit of a stepdown versus Q3. But if we put a few reasons behind it, one is when I think about the toughest comp of the year, our commercial HVAC businesses, this is really the toughest comp across the board going into the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis. Second would be the contribution from price. We would expect to be a bit lower in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. We commented price delivered around 4 points of growth in Q3. You probably dialed that into about 2-ish points of growth in Q4, so there's about 2 points right there sequentially. And then maybe just to round out another response here, really be around residential as it continues to normalize. We did a little better in the third quarter on revenues. Our constructive view around residential for the full year hasn't changed with revenues down around mid-single digits. So we're very focused on making sure inventory in the channel is positioned well for the start of 2024. So we would expect that normalization to continue really into the fourth quarter. So hope that gives you a little bit of some view here on how we think about Q3 to Q4. But let's not forget maybe the first point, the commercial HVAC on tough comps, we had 40% growth in EMEA last year, 30% growth in Asia last year, really toughest comp of the quarter. Operator : Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Impressive quarter. Dave, with the understanding that orders can be lumpy, it appears that you actually had a positive inflection in orders in Americas commercial HVAC in the quarter despite concerns of higher U.S. rates. So did you see larger mega projects start to hit a little more frequently in the quarter? I know you mentioned strength in data centers. Did you see like some of your bigger verticals actually heat up a bit as the quarter went on? And would you say that, that gives you more of a probability of ending backlog at the end of this year closer to $7 billion and $6 billion as I know you're guiding? David Regnery : Yes. I mean, we're still tracking a lot of \"mega projects\", and we're defining a mega project, again, as a project where the total revenue -- total size of it is over $1 billion. We're still tracking a lot of those in our pipeline. So yes, we had a little bit of activity in the third quarter but we just had some really nice growth. And as I said earlier, data centers, education continues to be very strong. And then we had like what I would call solid performance over a lot of different verticals, health care, life science, government, industrial. Those are all very solid performance in the quarter. So I think a lot of the mega projects are yet to come, which is still good news. And I think I've told you on our second quarter call, our ability to track these projects and to triage them on a global basis because some of these big mega projects, you have decision-makers that are in different parts of the world. And you have -- you could have the owner in Korea, you could have the engineer in Seattle, Washington and the project is in Texas. And we're able to triage that and work with the customer and show the value that we can provide. So we're super excited about a lot of the mega projects that are still in the pipeline. Andrew Kaplowitz : And then Chris, could you give more color into the organic leverage you've been delivering. Organic leverage in the mid-30% range is obviously a good result for Trane. We know you're guiding to 30% for Q4 and 25%-plus long term. But maybe you could talk about whether you have an extended period of productivity projects along with good price versus costs that could help your margin performance well into '24, given I think it was more difficult to engage these projects during the pandemic? Christopher Kuehn : Yes, Andy, it's a great question. And I would say we go into every year looking at incrementals in the 25% or better category, right? And we'll dial that in as we get a little closer to 2024. But we continue to see this dovetail of the contributions from growth price normalizing, with the gross productivity getting better as we work through the quarter this year -- the quarters this year. The supply chain has continued to improve. With that, the volume growth has continued to grow each and every quarter. We delivered around 5 points of volume growth here in the third quarter. And with that, the inefficiencies, as you said, it was hard to get that productivity the last couple of years. The inefficiencies have gotten less. So there's a lot of room to go here. We're starting to see some of the benefits of that in 2023, but this will be a continued opportunity for us as we go into 2024 really and beyond.  We're really getting back to the DNA of the company, right? The ability for us to drive the lean culture and look at cost takeout and ultimately lean through with automation in our factories, these are all investments we're making this year. And we're able to pivot the workforce to focus on that versus the supply chain challenges over the last few years. David Regnery : Yes, Andy, I had the opportunity to visit several of our locations during the quarter. It was just such a great feeling to feel the flow that's happening in the operations today versus where we were a year ago, where we were looking at the yard full of product that had to go back on the line to be reworked. So that's all helping with the productivity. So we're really starting to hit our stride here in our operations, which is a great job by the team because they've had some tough times they're working through the supply chain. But I'm glad to say that they're operating extremely well right now. Operator : Your next question is from Gautam Khanna of TD Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Great quarter. Just wanted to get your sense on, you mentioned the transport refrigeration, you opened the order books in October. Any early read on how demand looks and how far out you're booking into 2024 right now? David Regnery : Yes. I mean, like I said, we did open the order book in October. As expected, Gautam, I mean, the Thermo King business has performed very well for us over a number of years. And with our current guide, we're forecasting that we're going to outperform the markets again in 2023. So it's a great business. We have a lot of innovation that we're pumping through that business right now as we electrify our portfolio of products. Great team, and it's -- I'm pretty excited about where we are with Thermo King. I know that ACT is forecasting a bit of a dip in 2024. We're validating that. There's some things that don't align up with our internal forecast, but we'll validate that in the short term and update everyone as we report out our fourth quarter earnings. Gautam Khanna : Okay. Can you comment on how far out you guys are actually booking into '24 at this point or... David Regnery : It's always within a 12-month period. So these orders don't get booked way out. But in fact, in the prior years, we would only open up the book for 6-month increments. So just because we wanted to make sure we are pricing right when we were in a higher inflation market. Christopher Kuehn : Yes. I think for Americas, it [indiscernible] through middle of '24, Gautam. And I think for Europe, it may be open for a bit longer than that. But to Dave's point, the order book would really only be for 2024 at this point. Gautam Khanna : And just 1 quick follow-up on resi. Any evidence of people deferring replacement and instead repairing units? Are you seeing any uptick in those products? David Regnery : Yes. I was with the resi team recently. We're not seeing that, no. So I think the short answer is no, we haven't seen that yet. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Snyder of UBS. Christopher Snyder : I wanted to ask on commercial HVAC. Orders this quarter clearly bifurcated from the broader industry. And the company has always prided itself on driving innovation. So I guess my question is the world moving to emissions targets and just higher electricity prices globally, are you seeing customers more so appreciate the innovation and efficiency that you are providing to them? And do you think that could result in a higher rate of share gains moving forward? David Regnery : Chris, hope all is well with you. Great question. Look, we always lead with innovation. I think our customers always appreciate higher efficient products, greener products using low-GWP refrigerants, so we pride ourselves on that. Look, we do a lot of innovation around verticals, and I don't talk a lot about that for obvious reasons. But if you think of data centers, we had a very strong quarter in data centers. A lot of that has to do with the innovation that we're providing working with the customer. So these are unique solutions for them and then they scale it through all the data centers that they're building. So we'll continue to do that in the future. We'll continue to sell our energy efficiency to our customers. And we'll continue to make sure that we have a connected solutions so that our service business can continue to expand in the future. Christopher Snyder : I appreciate that. And then maybe following up, Dave, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that orders need to go down at some point due to the law of large numbers. So the other question is wouldn't you need like a step change negative in the macro to see that? Because it feels like the lead time compression headwinds are kind of largely in the rearview at this point. Commercial is healthy. Resi seems to be turning. And you mentioned before, the mega projects really haven't ordered yet. It's mostly still in the pipeline. So I mean, what do you need to see on a macro standpoint to have material order declines off these levels? Christopher Kuehn : Yes, Chris. It's Chris. I'll start. This is why we want to make sure it's important that investors look at growth rates as well as backlog position and just absolute bookings levels, right? I think the trends around decarbonization, and as you mentioned just before, customers putting out emissions targets, we see these as long-term tailwinds. Growth around data centers appears to be a multiyear tailwind as we think about the need for data and for saving data and to process data. So we see this as some longer-term tailwinds. When we think about the beginning of the year, we guided ending backlog down to around $6 billion, and that would have implied bookings down around 5%, 6%. But even on a down 5% or 6%, that would have been still very elevated levels in terms of absolute bookings, and we continue to see that strength here through the third quarter. So I would say the trends, we don't necessarily see, as abating. Could we find some quarters where the backlog will start to normalize or bookings growth will be negative? I guess we could. But I would just encourage people to look at absolute bookings levels because when you look at 2-year stacks, 3-year stacks around bookings growth, they're significant. You think about commercial HVAC in the Americas, a 3-year booking stack of over... David Regnery : 65%. Christopher Kuehn : 65%. So the fact is if we went down 5 points in a given period, you still have to subtract that from 65% points of growth. So maybe a bit of a long answer to your question, but where we're confident we've got a long-term tailwind here. Operator : Your next question is from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Nice quarter. So yesterday, Eaton resized the mega project funnel up 25%, now tracking almost close to like $900 billion. And they suggested that about 20% of the projects have kind of broken ground and a lower percentage, they've actually bid. I'm curious, like I know that you guys have your own funnel and you guys are also tracking projects over $1 billion. But does that all kind of jive with what you're seeing in your pipeline broadly? Or any other color around that would be helpful. David Regnery : Yes. I haven't read Eaton's reports so I can't comment specifically. I would just tell you that we have a lot of projects in the pipeline right now that we're tracking. I think it's always -- you always have to be a little bit careful when you track 1 company versus another company is when orders are procured by different companies could vary. So Eaton maybe a bit before us. But I guess the good news is we still see a lot out there. It sounds like Eaton does as well, and we're very, very confident with many of the solutions that we have that we're talking with customers about and we feel that many of these projects, we're in a unique position. Joseph Ritchie : Yes. Maybe following up on that, Dave. [indiscernible] had any concerns? I know you're not seeing it really in the order book today, but are there any concerns out there on project financing or things putting to the right, just given the rate environment that we're in? Christopher Kuehn : Joe, it's Chris. No, we're not. I think while certainly interest rates have gone in the negative direction on paybacks, I would tell you that the change in paybacks is minor when we think about the energy-efficient systems that we're able to quote customers. A payback may have gone from 2, 2.5 years to 3-ish years now with interest rates. So the fact is there's still very strong paybacks when you're implementing some of these solutions. So we're not seeing that right now. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That makes sense. And I guess maybe 1 last 1 quickly for you, Chris. I know that we're kind of not ready to bless any 2024 numbers at this point. But as you kind of think through both pricing and mix for next year, just any thoughts -- initial thoughts on how that should kind of play out across the Americas business? Christopher Kuehn : Yes. We'll dial it in a little bit further, Joe, as we get a couple of months from now. But we do target, from a price inflation measure, let's say, a spread of 20 to 30 basis points in a normal year. We'll dial that in as we get closer to next year. To Dave's earlier point, we're making sure we're pricing for innovation and also long-term customer relationships. So I'm confident that we'll have a good set of numbers there. We're going to target positive on a dollar basis and a margin basis on price versus inflation. And we've been able to demonstrate that for the last 3 years, so I have a lot of confidence our teams will be able to do that going forward. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Charles Tusa : I'll echo, those orders, pretty strong for sure. What were -- there's been a lot of strength in light commercial. How strong was your light commercial business, large and light? David Regnery : Our revenue was up, in the Americas, was up over 20%. Equipment was up over 30%. Applied was stronger than unitary. Charles Tusa : Applied was stronger than unitary? David Regnery : Yes, yes, yes. Both were strong but applied was stronger than unitary. I mean, you could look at the verticals that really had the strength in it, Steve. You have data centers, high tech, education. Those tend to be more applied systems. And even the verticals that were solid like health care, life science, again, those tend to be the more intricate projects where you need really a design system, which is our applied systems. So we're pretty happy with the performance that we saw in the third quarter. And again, not to iterate, but these implied, I know you know this, but this is where you get the long service tail. And so this is going to continue to fuel our service business in the future. Charles Tusa : Yes. Can you just give us maybe a little -- I know you kind of -- you haven't done this before, but like you've mentioned these 4 verticals in every slide presentation for like the last several years. Obviously, you guys are doing a great job there. Can you just give us -- given it's so important now, I mean, commercial HVAC 65% of your revenue base. Can you just give us some sort of color on how much those 4 verticals represent now? I mean, is that like 50% of your portfolio? Like just roughly how much those growth verticals represent? Christopher Kuehn : They're strong, Steve, is what I would answer. We track about 14 verticals in the Americas. And certainly, office and warehousing would be areas, retail, that'd be a little bit weaker today. I know the office vertical has a number of things kind of buried in it today. We've been lobbying to try to break that out, just given demand on warehouse and data centers. But I won't dial it in specifically but we like our positioning here. And what I think is, again, most important with the direct sales force is their ability that if a vertical is slower like office, the ability to pivot into another vertical is really... David Regnery : That's exactly where I was going to go, Chris. I mean, these verticals, we track 14. You could even get 18 if you do a little subdividing there. But there's oftentimes when 1 vertical is stronger than another vertical for an extended period of time, I'll use warehousing as an example. Two years ago, 3 years ago, warehousing was extremely strong. We pivot our sales force to focus on warehousing. We develop programs for them, and they go capture share in those particular verticals. Right now, the strength in data centers, I don't see that going away in the near term. High tech, we have all the mega projects that are really in front of us. And education, education has been strong. Obviously, ESSER funding is helping that. I think ESSER funding is probably in the fifth or sixth inning, but we've been extremely strong in education for an extended period of time. Charles Tusa : One last 1 for you. Your peers have talked about this refrigerant change in resi driving some pretty nice price mix, 10% to 15% or something like that over the next couple of years, perhaps a bit more back-end loaded into '25, given the change comes then. Can you just give us your latest and greatest lens on price and mix from that transition and what potentially you could see in '24 and '25 on that front for resi? David Regnery : Yes. The short answer is we're dialing it in. But I mean, if you think about the whole refrigerant change, right, we've been leading with refrigerant change really the industry, I think we've been at it since about 2013 with next-generation refrigerants. So we're more than ready for this transition away from 410 to, in our case, 454B. Our designs are complete, our manufacturing is ready to go. We're going to start up production here in early Q2. So all systems goes there. There are some definitions, Steve, that we're still working with the EPA to make sure our interpretation is correct. And then really our focus is going to shift to the channel. I'm sure we have a clean phase in, phase out of inventory. We will be manufacturing both 410 product and 454 product in 2024 and probably even into 2025, at least our interpretation right now, what we're seeing with the EPA. As far as price, we're still dialing that in. The 454 product is going to be more expensive. Obviously, it's a slightly flammable refrigerant so you're going to have to put different sensing equipment around the union. So we'll get more data on that in the coming weeks here, and we'll update everyone on our fourth quarter call. Operator : Your next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Jeffrey Sprague : Not as good as you guys but doing well. I wonder if we could just dig a little bit more into just customer behavior and backlogs. As big as the backlogs are versus history, right, if I think about 90% of $6 billion, maybe it's $6 billion-plus, right, but that would be, call it, my math, roughly half of your 2024 commercial revenues are in backlog. I mean, that's a good healthy number. But given the size and scope of some of these projects, maybe goes back a little bit to one of the earlier questions. I'm not sure why backlog would really go down much from here. Do you actually see customers just kind of changing their order patterns or there's kind of something else that would suggest that backlogs really do need to kind of go back down towards where they were historically? Christopher Kuehn : Jeff, I'll start. I mean, I think the lead times are still a bit extended in applied systems, getting better certainly from where we were beginning of the year. Same in unitary, getting better. So I think as the lead times come in a bit, you may see where the backlog contracts a bit over time. It is elevated today. You're right, 90% of the backlog would relate to our global commercial HVAC business. And when you think about our commercial businesses, including Thermo King, it's over 95%. So it gives us a lot of visibility into what we think 2024 would be with some healthy growth. But let's see how the policy stacking effects that continue to positively affect us and order rates. Mega projects, as Dave said, are ahead of us here in terms of bookings. And applied, these are long-cycle kind of projects. Let's see how this plays out. We think it can be elevated for longer, but it will start to normalize at some point. David Regnery : Yes. I think the only thing I would add to that, Jeff, is I'll go back to data centers again, and kind of our strategy was to work with the data center engineers and develop solutions that are optimal for them. Once we do that, they do tend to lock in for an extended period of time with you. So they'll provide orders beyond your lead times just to ensure that they have slots available and we don't disappoint missing a shipment. Jeffrey Sprague : And can you gauge in any way what percent of this forward project pipeline is tied to various stimulus programs, be they IRA, CHIPS, other things and what's coming down through the state promulgations? Christopher Kuehn : Jeff, I would say from an IRA perspective, that's really all in front of us. I don't think that's necessarily in the backlog today. But from an ESSER funding for several years now, we've had projects and making sure that over the summer months when schools are open, we're ready to service and upgrade equipment. So I think that's certainly been the backlog for a while. Data centers continues to elevate and we see it as a long-term tail. But CHIPS and Science Act, we don't have that dialed in but that would be one where I guess you could specifically say this is driving this demand. But in the data center, there's no -- that's more about just pure demand for data centers right now. Operator : Your next question is from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : So going back to the commercial HVAC growth in Q3, which was obviously spectacular, but especially in the Americas, the pickup Q-over-Q was quite something. So you called out obviously the strength in the verticals. Was there any kind of supply chain sort of loosening or kind of flush there that maybe drove that? Understand demand is very strong. And then within that, education, I think there's some concerns out there with the stimulus funding kind of reaching a peak, perhaps that maybe education falls off in '24. So any visibility on education would be helpful. David Regnery : Yes, I'll start with the latter. The education, we haven't seen a cooloff yet. We still have a lot in our pipeline as well. There's still a lot of money to be spent out there. As I said, I think if we had a -- we were playing baseball, I'd say we're in the sixth inning. There's still some funding to come there. We've been strong there for an extended period of time. The other question was... Nigel Coe : Yes. Just obviously, supply chain constraints have been a factor in the applied business, yes. David Regnery : The supply chain, it's -- I wouldn't say it's normal but it's pretty close to normal. We always have some noise that you're going to see in the supply chain, but our teams have done just a great job there. So I wouldn't say it was -- I would not say our third quarter performance was because supply chain suddenly got better because it's been [indiscernible]. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then on the comment... David Regnery : We're executing very well on the front end of our business. We're executing very well on the operations side of our business and you really see it in our results. Nigel Coe : Okay. Just quick -- another crack at the pricing question. Chris, you mentioned basis points spread versus inflation is what you target. It does feel like some of your competitors are taking a much more aggressive policy towards pricing. So I'm just curious on 2 aspects. Number one, the potential to really be a bit more aggressive on price as you go into '24. And then secondly, as this commercial HVAC backlog starts to convert, is there sort of embedded pricing in that backlog that's going to emerge over the next 12 months? Christopher Kuehn : Yes, I'll start with your second question, Nigel. As we think about the backlog that runs out 1 year, 1.5 years, we're making sure that we've got the right cost escalators built in. And it could be a reference to an external index or it could be where we've put cost inflators into the project to ultimately make sure we're pricing effectively. So I think we've got that embedded in the backlog right now on a best view. And the teams have done an outstanding job with this over the last 3-plus years in the inflationary environment to stay ahead on inflation. Yes. Look, I think pricing will remain a way for us to continue to drive with our innovative products, making sure we're pricing effectively. It's going to be healthy. I just want to get 3 more months ahead of us here before we dial it in for 2024. But I am confident that as we think about the cost environment and the innovation of our products, we're going to make sure we're pricing effectively. And again, making sure we've got long-term customer relationships here, as Dave described, with the applied business, we want to make sure that the services business continues to grow with that, which we can and it will. And that, of course, brings with itself healthy margins. So we're well positioned for next year. Just give us a little more time to dial that in. Operator : Your next question is from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : Maybe to circle back on China, you had good bookings. It was impressed that even though you had lighter margins -- lighter revenues, the margins were much stronger. So how did China play out for you? David Regnery : I'm very happy with our performance in Asia Pacific overall, so thanks for the question. You think about -- I'll start with orders, right? I mean, orders were up in the low teens, up 12%, okay, for the region. And China had high single digits and the rest of Asia had mid-teens, so very strong performance on order rate. On revenue, we were flattish, down a bit. But remember, last year, we had 30% growth in Asia Pacific so it's really just a comp issue. The team there is performing very well. I was very, very happy with the incoming order rates in that region. And the pipeline is strong as well. Deane Dray : Great. And just as a follow-up to that September customer experience event in New York, can you give us a sense of the -- on the applied business, both the backlog and the funnel, how much is -- are customers opting for this thermal management feature? We still -- since you're like using the baseball analogy, is it -- are we in the early innings of adoption? Where does that stand? David Regnery : Yes, thermal storage. Yes, I mean, we have adoption that's continuous there. We've been selling thermal storage systems for quite some time. I do think that one of the elements of IRA that could accelerate that is that would be included there. And we're still dialing in what that exact rebate would be and how it will be applied. But that could be significant and really drive that. And just so everyone's aware, thermal management -- our thermal storage systems are great ways for energy efficiency but they're also great ways to help balance the grid. And if you have a need and a peak period to shut off power or limit power, this is a great way to do it because you burn ice versus running your compressors on your chillers. So we're excited about the technology. We've had it for a while, and IRA could be a catalyst to even have it grow faster. Operator : Your next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Andrew Obin : A question on gross margins, I guess. Look at my model, I think gross margins are hitting all-time highs. And I know you guys don't look at other companies but we do. And I'm just wondering how much price cost, the spread between price cost is a benefit. And I guess the bigger question is, have we rebased gross margins? Because clearly, you guys have done a lot of work on cost cutting, right? It seems that you have an aggressive stance on maintaining the spread. But also how much of it is timing, right? It's just the peak between the balance between price and cost. So if you could just talk about, are we in the new normal with gross margins or should we expect the gross margins normalize somewhat going forward? Christopher Kuehn : Andrew, I'll start. As I think about the third quarter, we really were able to execute across all parts of the P&L to drive leverage and gross margin expansion. So the price execution versus inflation, as I said earlier, it was positive on a margin and dollar basis. There are areas, though, of inflation, especially in tier 2 around wage and energy inflation that are impacting the business. So it was a positive. The incrementals on volume and 5 points of volume in the quarter so we like those incrementals. And we've continued to invest in the business as well, right? We're still targeting for the full year around 70 basis points of incremental investment above a 40 basis point normal. So all parts of the P&L are really working. But I would tell you the productivity opportunity for us as price comes back to a bit more of a normalized level, that is really the opportunity for us going forward to really continue to drive 25% or better incrementals. David Regnery : And we really like our mix and service. Andrew Obin : So services was driving high gross margins as well? Christopher Kuehn : It's a contributor, right? David Regnery : It was a contributor. It was a system of things that does it, but we really like the mix we have with our service business. Andrew Obin : Great. And just a follow-up question on Nuvolo, right? I think JCI also bought a workplace management software company. Fortive has a presence. Can you just talk about what excites you about this vertical and maybe also remind us how big is software as a business for you at this point? David Regnery : Yes. Nuvolo is a cloud-based connected workplace and enterprise asset management company, and it's leveraging the ServiceNow platform. Look, we look at this as a way to augment our current digital capabilities. Just to remind everyone, we have over 36,000 connected buildings. We have well over 1 million connected assets. So we think this is a great company, great leadership, great technology, and we're excited to get this closed and have it be part of the Trane Technologies portfolio, and it's going to really help us grow our digital business at a nice clip. Andrew Obin : And how big is the digital business now? David Regnery : I won't be specific on that. I would say that this acquisition is less than 1% of the enterprise revenue. Operator : We have completed the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zachary Nagle : Thanks, operator. I'd like to thank everyone for joining on today's call. As always, we'll be available in the coming days and weeks to answer any questions that you may have, so please don't hesitate to reach out. Stay safe, and we look forward to seeing everyone soon. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President, Investor Relations. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We're also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Zach and everyone, for joining today's call. As we begin, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which drives our differentiated financial results over time. Our strategy is aligned to powerful mega trends like energy efficiency, decarbonization, and digital transformation. These trends continue to intensify and increase the demand for our sustainable solutions. The year 2023 was recently confirmed as the warmest on record and caused many extreme weather events around the world. Urgent action is needed to reduce emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change on people's lives. That's where Trane Technologies is uniquely positioned to lead. We are the partner of choice to help our customers advance their own sustainability goals while driving broad impact through our Gigaton Challenge, a pledge to reduce customers' emissions by 1 billion metric tons by 2030. Our purpose-driven strategy, relentless innovation and proven business operating system, enable us to consistently deliver a superior growth profile, strong margins and powerful free cash flow. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our customers, our shareholders, our employees, and for the planet. Please turn to Slide number 4. We expect to deliver top quartile financial performance over the long-term, consistently and reliably on behalf of our shareholders. This is core to our culture and central to how we set our targets and execute our strategy across our global portfolio. I'm proud of how our global teams rose to the challenge in 2023 and met or exceeded our targets top to bottom. We track top quartile performance against our core peer group closely. And while the results are not yet in, we believe we'll hit top quartile on organic revenue growth up 9%, and adjusted EPS growth up 23%. We also delivered free cash flow of $2.2 billion or 103% free cash flow conversion, enabling us to make key strategic M&A investments while raising our dividend and returning significant cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Please turn to Slide number 5. Relentless investment in innovation and growth, people and culture and our business operating system are hallmarks of Trane Technologies. And over time, we see clear benefits accruing as evidenced by our strong track record. Since 2020, we have delivered a revenue compound annual growth rate of 12%, 260 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion and free cash flow conversion of approximately 100%, enabling us to execute a balanced capital deployment strategy. We believe we're well positioned to continue to drive strong performance for shareholders over the long-term. Please turn to Slide number 6. Q4 was another strong quarter. Despite challenges in our transport and residential businesses, we leveraged the strength of our diversified and resilient global portfolio in our best-in-class business operating system to deliver strong financial performance as an enterprise. In the Americas, we expected the residential markets to continue to normalize and for the transport refrigeration markets to move into a moderate down cycle in Q4. While the markets were down more than anticipated, each business delivered strong bookings growth in the quarter, strengthening our position entering 2024. Global commercial HVAC markets continue to be robust, and we're leveraging the power of our direct sales force to identify and pivot to the highest growth opportunities. We're thriving in key verticals such as data centers and high-tech industrial, working alongside these highly sophisticated customers to solve their most pressing challenges with ultra-efficient bespoke solutions. This is one of the things that Trane Technologies does best, and our commercial HVAC bookings, backlog and revenue reflect our success. To put this into context, our Americas commercial HVAC bookings are up more than 50% on a three-year stack. Our applied bookings, where we estimate an 8 to 10x multiplier of higher-margin services for every dollar of equipment sold, are up over 100% on a three-year stack. As we look at our commercial HVAC end markets over the next several years, we see a strong pipeline of projects increasingly playing to our unique strengths. We entered 2024 with a backlog of $6.9 billion, with the composition shifting increasingly towards commercial HVAC, including a large percentage of long-cycle applied systems. For 2023, backlog in commercial HVAC is up approximately $700 million. Over the past three years, our commercial HVAC backlog has nearly tripled. Turning to guidance. We expect another year of strong financial performance, with organic revenue growth of 6% to 7%, and adjusted EPS of $10 to $10.30. Chris will discuss some of the key dynamics later in the presentation. Please go to Slide number 7. Demand for our innovative products and services continues to be broad-based across our segments. During the fourth quarter, organic bookings were up 12%, led by our commercial HVAC businesses. In the Americas segment, commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-teens and revenues were even stronger, up mid-20s. Revenues were up more than 30% in equipment, with particular strength in applied. Services growth was also outstanding, up mid-teens as our service business continues to compound at a rapid rate. Our residential business continues to normalize, as expected, but the market declined at a faster rate than anticipated entering the quarter. We expect the normalization process to continue in the near term but to return to a GDP plus growth over the medium to long-term. Bookings were healthy, up 8%. Our transport businesses was the tale of two halves. The first half of the year, revenues were up about 20% and the back half of the year down 20%. Q4 marked the beginning of a modest market down cycle, which is expected to snap back in 2025. Our fourth quarter was down approximately 20% against a tough prior year growth comp of up 30%. For full year 2023, we modestly outperformed end markets, which were down 5%. Our EMEA segment delivered strong performance in the quarter. Commercial HVAC bookings were robust, up mid-teens. Revenues were up high single digits in Q4 and up more than 50% on a two-year stack. Transport bookings were flat as expected, and revenues were up mid-single digits for Q4. In 2023, revenues were up low single-digits, outperforming end markets, which were down mid-single digits. Our Asia-Pacific segment performed in line with our expectations. Revenues were flat in commercial HVAC due to a tough prior year comp, which was up low 20s. China bookings were down low single digits but up high single-digits on a two-year stack. Revenues were down mid-single digits against and up low teens prior year comp. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number 8. The scoreboard for the quarter highlights strong execution top to bottom. Organic revenues were up 6%, adjusted EBITDA and operating margins were up 150 basis points and 190 basis points, respectively, and adjusted EPS was up 19%. Q4 adjusted EPS includes a $0.03 headwind related to foreign exchange losses from the devaluation of the Argentine peso. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up low single-digits and low teens, respectively. Services growth continues to be a standout, representing about one-third of our enterprise revenues and making Trane Technologies more resilient, with higher recurring revenues and higher margins over time. Over the past six years, our services business delivered a compound annual growth rate of high single-digits. 2023 services growth was even higher, up double digits. Last but not least, I want to thank our global teams for once again delivering strong free cash flow throughout the year, resulting in a 103% free cash flow conversion. Please turn to Slide number 9. At the enterprise level, we delivered robust volume growth with strong incrementals, positive price realization and productivity that more than offset inflation. In the Americas segment, we delivered about 4 points of volume and 3 points of price and 200 basis points of margin expansion. While volume growth was modestly higher than price growth at the segment level, it's important to understand the dynamics below the segment level. Robust volume growth of approximately 20 points in commercial HVAC accompanied by strong leverage more than offset volume declines in residential and transport. EMEA segment delivered strong incrementals and margin expansion, with organic revenues up high single-digits in the quarter made up of approximately 5 points of volume and 3 points of price. The segment also delivered approximately 6 points of M&A growth in the quarter. Organic incrementals were greater than 30%. The Asia segment delivered strong margin expansion and organic leverage on flattish revenues, with positive price and productivity in the quarter adding to margin expansion. As we've highlighted throughout the year, we reinvested heavily in our business and accelerated the timing of key projects across the enterprise in 2023. We see a tight linkage between investments in innovation and market outgrowth, and we will continue to leverage opportunities to go further and faster. A few high-priority areas in 2023 and 2024 are sales and services excellence, digital, and factory automation. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide number 10. Looking at our segments and markets, we're excited about excited the year ahead. We expect continued strength in our commercial HVAC businesses globally, which comprise about 65% of our revenues, supported by robust end markets, unprecedented backlog, our innovative portfolio and our world-class sales and services teams. We expect the strength of this business to more than offset softness we may see in other parts of the portfolio. We expect the residential markets, which comprise about 20% of our revenues to continue to normalize in the near term but to show significant improvement in 2024 versus 2023. We expect modest declines in our transport markets globally in 2024, which comprise about 15% of our revenues, with a snapback to growth in 2025. Further, we see opportunities to outperform and further mitigate the market impact and to deleverage within gross margin rates. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide number 11. Our guidance for 2024 reflects our optimism in key end markets and our ability to outperform. Embedded in our guidance is our philosophy around our value creation flywheel, which builds in continued investment in innovation, outgrowth across our end markets, healthy leverage and strong free cash flow. We\u2019re guiding 2024 to 6% to 7% organic revenue growth and $10 to $10.30 in adjusted earnings per share or approximately 11% to 14% EPS growth. We\u2019ve included approximately 1 point of growth from M&A in 2024, reflecting the carryover impact from bolt-on acquisitions completed in 2023. We\u2019re targeting organic leverage of 25% plus for the year, which is consistent with our stated long-term target. While we expect our recent M&A transactions to have a strong payout over the next several years, we\u2019re expecting a modest headwind to operating income and to leverage in 2024 from M&A. Overall, we expect a negative impact of $30 million to operating income for the full year, primarily related to our technology acquisition Nuvolo, which carries non-cash accelerated intangibles amortization of approximately $25 million plus year one acquisition and integration related costs. We expect this acquisition to be EPS accretive by year three, consistent with our M&A. Turning to cash. We expect 2024 to be another year of free cash flow conversion of 100% or greater. We also wanted to provide some color on how we see the first quarter. We expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7%, led by continued strong commercial HVAC growth partially offset by softer residential and transport markets. We expect adjusted EPS between $1.60 and $1.65, reflecting high levels of incremental business reinvestment we\u2019ve discussed for 2024 and consistent with our historical Q1 adjusted earnings as a percentage of our full year earnings between 15% and 16%. Please go to Slide number 12. During 2023, we delivered an incremental $60 million of transformation savings. Over the last four years, we have successfully delivered $300 million of run rate savings from our business transformation program. The additional savings have allowed us to reinvest in our high performance flywheel, which ultimately drives consistent top quartile EPS growth. While this discrete program is complete as a lean based company with a world class business operating system, self-help, cost reduction programs, through productivity are part of our DNA. This has been a strong lever for incremental margins historically and will continue to be in the future. Please go to Slide number 13. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we\u2019re committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide number 14 and I\u2019ll provide an update on our capital deployment for 2023 and our outlook for 2024. During 2023 and including activity in January 2024, we deployed $2.4 billion in cash, including approximately $750 million to share repurchases, $684 million to dividends, and approximately $900 million on strategic M&A. We\u2019re targeting $2.5 billion in capital deployment in 2024 and expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time. We have significant dry powder with approximately $2.5 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, and our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet continue to give us excellent capital allocation optionality. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and in 2023 we made key strategic investments to accelerate our progress across energy services and digital solutions, industrial process cooling and precision temperature control technology. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please go to Slide number 16. In 2023, we delivered solid execution across our transport businesses globally and outperformed our end markets. Over the past three years, we\u2019ve outgrown our end markets by roughly 30 percentage points. Globally in 2024, we\u2019re expecting a relatively shallow down cycle and an Americas transport weighted average forecast of down 10% and an EMEA forecast of down low single digits. In the table on the page we\u2019ve also included forecasts for the big three trailer, truck and APU for your reference. We expect to outperform the markets in both segments in 2024 and to delever within gross margin rates. This slide also includes some additional data points related to our transport businesses that you may find helpful. Please turn to Slide number 17. We operate our transport businesses for the long-term and while we\u2019re moving through a modest downturn in 2024, this is a great business with a bright future. ACT projects a strong trailer market rebound from 2024 to 2025, up 19% and projects continued growth through their forecast horizon in 2028. We have a diversified transport business globally with opportunities to grow across the portfolio. With leading innovation, strong execution through our business operating system and a world class dealer network, we\u2019re well positioned to outperform in any market environment. Please go to Slide number 18. In summary, we are well positioned to drive significant value over time. We are proud to have been recently named to Corporate Knights 2024 Global 100 list. Our uplifting culture and our talented team around the world help us fulfill our purpose every day. This focus on purpose, along with the strength of our business operating system and continued high levels of customer demand, enable us to consistently deliver strong financial performance while continuing to reinvest in our business. We believe we have the strategy, the innovation and the team to deliver strong performance in 2024 and differentiated shareholder returns over the long-term. And now, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, guys, Dave and Chris and Zac. Dave Regnery : Good morning. Scott Davis : Feel like a broken record, but good quarter year, et cetera. You took looks like $60 million or something of cost out structurally. Just to clarify, is that to kind of reset the cost base into this downturn in transport and perhaps resi? Or is that more kind of structurally spread out? Chris Kuehn : Hey, Scott, it\u2019s Chris. The $60 million is, let\u2019s say, the final year of that $300 million cost takeout program that we launched at the start of Trane Technologies. $300 million run rate savings now achieved by the end of 2023. So we did really just want to put a little bit of a bow around that program. However, I would tell you that the business operating system that we\u2019ve had and we\u2019ve built over, over a decade it\u2019s really driven to drive strong productivity and cost savings over the long-term. So while that discrete program is behind us, I would say we\u2019re very focused on the cost structure of the company and making sure we\u2019re getting the right leverage over the long-term. And so we\u2019ll always look at opportunities to lean out the structure in the organization. Scott Davis : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And guys, you\u2019ve got a high class problem and that you\u2019re generating a lot of cash. You\u2019ve delevered. Give us a sense, the M&A kind of possibles. Is there a pipeline? I know you have a competitor that seems like they\u2019re going to be selling some assets. But is there an active pipeline that\u2019s interesting and material enough to kind of help put capital to work? I mean, share buybacks obviously can always be an option. But walk us through kind of how you think about M&A at least? And whether there is kind of a higher or lower or some sort of a TAM associated with potentials out there that you guys think about. Dave Regnery : Hey, Scott, how are you doing? This is Dave. Look, our M&A pipeline is strong, and I think we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate, I think we actually closed five deals in 2023. We like technologies, we like products that we could put through our channels. And I think you see the success that we\u2019ve had with those, whether it be MTA last year, AL-KO. We recently acquired Nuvolo, which we\u2019re very excited about from think of it as augmenting our connected solutions. Very excited the more I learn about Nuvolo. So, look, we have a very active pipeline. We love the portfolio we have today. So I think you\u2019ve heard me say in the past, we don\u2019t need to do anything, but obviously, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities where we can take a technology or a channel and expand what we do great today. So we\u2019ll continue to be active in that area and expect more to come. Scott Davis : Fair enough. Best of luck this year, guys. Dave Regnery : All right. Hey, thanks, Scott. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just the first question around the organic growth framework for the year. So you have the 6% to 7% guide. When we\u2019re thinking sort of by maybe end market vertical, let\u2019s say, rather than your geographic segments, is it fair to assume that that growth rate you\u2019re embedding sort of 9%, 10% in commercial HVAC, maybe flattish in resi and then down single digits in TK globally, is that roughly the right framework? Dave Regnery : I think you\u2019re pretty close there, so you\u2019re spot on there, Julian. Julian Mitchell : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then just my, I guess, quick follow up would be on the operating leverage point. The organic operating leverage of sort of 25% plus, you\u2019ve got that that\u2019s your normal run rate, but a step down from what was realized in 2023. The step down is that just \u2013 it\u2019s early in the year, so no reason to diverge from the long-term framework. Or is there anything specific going on in terms of, say, a much smaller price cost tailwind, maybe something in mix or accelerating reinvestment spend, anything like that you\u2019d call out when thinking about the organic leverage 2024 versus last year? Chris Kuehn : Yes. Thanks, Julian. It\u2019s Chris. Look, the 25% organic leverage 2024 versus last year? Chris Kuehn : Yes.  Thanks, Julian. It\u2019s Chris. Look, the 25% organic leverage, or better, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s part of our long-term target within the company and our guide for 2024, it gives us a lot of optionality to invest back in our businesses at a steady rate and really drive market outgrowth. And I\u2019ll tell you, we continue to see lots of opportunities to invest back into our businesses. We do expect 2024 to be a year of increased investments, just like 2023 was. And some of the examples we put out there. I mean, there\u2019s the continued innovation investment. Think about the electrification of our portfolios and heating, cooling and transport products, self help around factory automation, and we\u2019re always looking out three years to four years in terms of demand and making sure we\u2019ve got the infrastructure to keep up with that demand. So factory automation is a big investment for us. We continue into 2024. Digital, think about digital services, digital controls. Dave just talked about the Nuvolo acquisition we\u2019re very excited about as we continued investment there. Expanding digital twin opportunities. I can keep running down the list, but I\u2019ll end with sales and service investments. We really see that over now six years, driving high single-digit CAGR and services growth. We really like making investments in that space as well. It\u2019s about a third of our overall enterprise revenues. So the fact that we want to get started earlier in the year with those investments means that the payback will come sooner from that earlier start. So those are some of the reasons. But the guide is 25% plus. We want to make sure we\u2019re always relentlessly investing, and frankly, we don\u2019t want anyone to catch up to where our investments are today. Dave Regnery : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. We really like the model we have today with 25% plus. It gives us a lot of optionality, and as a CEO, you look at our results, right? And you look at the top-line, you say, okay, we\u2019re going to have 9% growth for the year. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be top quartile. We believe it will be. We\u2019ll see when everyone else reports. I look at the bottom line and I look at EPS growth of 23%. Pretty confident that\u2019ll be top quartile. And by the way, that\u2019s the third consecutive year that we\u2019ve had 20% or greater EPS growth. And then I look at the quality of our earnings, Julian, and I\u2019ll use free cash flow as a proxy to determine that. And over a three-year period, free cash flow of 100%. So, we\u2019re very happy with the model. And you take that and you wrap it around our culture, which is uplifting and a can do culture that we have at train technologies. We\u2019re very excited about the future, and we\u2019re very happy with our performance in the past. But I always tell people our brightest days are still in front of us. So expect more investment, expect more growth, and expect us to continue to innovate for the industry. Julian Mitchell : That makes a lot of sense. I just had one tiny follow up on the sales outlook, Dave. Transport down single digits. Any big divergence? First half versus second half in terms of the year-on-year there? Or right now, it looks pretty sort of steady down through the year. Dave Regnery : No, I think the first half will be tougher than the second half. Okay. A lot of that has to do with the comps. As I said in our prepared remarks. Think of the America\u2019s weighted average will be down in the 10%. We\u2019ll do better than that. We\u2019ll outperform. EMEA is a little bit down low single digits. We\u2019ll do better than that as well. Look, our Thermo King business, it\u2019s a great fact \u2013 actually, after right up to this meeting, I\u2019m going to be joining the Thermo King dealer network in the Americas. And it\u2019s a great business. We have such a great dealer network there. We\u2019ve been through these slight downturns before. This will snap back. If you look at what axe projecting right now, it\u2019s down in 2024, a quick snap back into 2025, and then they have growth through 2028. And we\u2019re very optimistic with a lot of the innovation that we\u2019ve already launched and what\u2019s coming, that this is a great business not only today, but well into the future. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Julian. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to ask about orders. The back half of the year, orders have been incredibly strong and have really bifurcated when compared to any sort of industry benchmark we look at or peers. Is there anything specific that\u2019s driving that pickup in orders that we\u2019ve seen over the last six months and anything you would comment on data center, because it feels like a lot of the ramp we\u2019ve seen has kind of lined up with a lot of the investment that we\u2019re seeing in data center and AI specifically? Thank you. Dave Regnery : Yes, Chris, great question. And our team has just executed at a very high level. I\u2019ll start with that. And you think about it, with the direct sales force, we\u2019re able to really pivot to where the opportunity is. And we track, I\u2019ll use the Americas here, but we track 14 different verticals and there are some verticals that are very strong right now. Data centers you just spoke about also in the high tech, think of the semiconductor space. Education is another, healthcare is another, very strong verticals. We\u2019re able to capture those opportunities with our direct sales force, very technical sales force, and be able to really meet or exceed, in many cases exceed our customers\u2019 expectations. So very happy with what we\u2019ve seen from an order growth standpoint in the Americas, very help and very happy as well as in Europe, that team has continued to perform very well. And in Asia, I know there\u2019s a lot of, we\u2019ve heard a lot on the different calls that have already occurred where people were talking about being down in Asia. Well, our business in Asia, with the leadership team we have there, we\u2019re doing very well in Asia. And our revenue growth in Asia last year was 10%. By the way, that\u2019s on a two-year stack that\u2019s 20%. So the team performs very well there. And I\u2019d be \u2013 also, the service business that we have, I could not be prouder of what our service business really on a global basis has been able to do. In 2023, our service business was up in the teens on a compound annual growth rate over the last six years; our service business has been up in the high, high single digits. As our installed base continues to increase in the applied space, you could see that tailwind really happening within service. So very happy with our results and very happy with the order book that we have going into 2024. It gives us a lot of visibility into 2024. Chris Snyder : I appreciate that. And then maybe just following up on data center, and I know we\u2019re in the very, very early innings on AI, but is there any way that you could frame Trane\u2019s positioning in that market, the opportunity that you see going forward, just because it is very new, but it also does seem very significant. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Yes, I mean, it\u2019s not new to us. We\u2019ve been in data centers for a long time. We\u2019re very strong in that vertical. There\u2019s a lot of public information out there that\u2019s trying to size the data center market, and it\u2019s somewhat difficult. You have a lot of variations in those reports just because by nature, the data center market is very confidential to data center providers. Okay? They don\u2019t want a lot of that information out. But if you look at the reports and just kind of triangulate it, you get a global market anywhere between, I mean it\u2019s a big range, but $6.5 billion [ph] to up to $10 billion. So, I mean, it\u2019s a big range out there. And if you look at growth rates, if you take the most conservative growth rate, you\u2019re going to see high teens, maybe mid teens growth on a compound annual growth rate for the next five years. So this is a very strong vertical today. We do very well in it with our very technical sales team calling on data center customers and working with them. It\u2019s very strong today and anticipate it being strong well into the future. Chris Snyder : Appreciate that. Thank you. Dave Regnery : All right, thanks, Chris. Have a great day. Operator : Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Dave Regnery : Hey, Gautam. Gautam. Operator, I think we might want to come back to Gautam. Operator : Certainly. I\u2019ll move on to Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Hey, guys. Good morning and nice end to the year. Dave, look, the service business we\u2019ve talked about now for several years, it\u2019s been great for you guys, and yet continues to accelerate in 2023. The double-digit growth number is pretty impressive. Could you maybe just point out what\u2019s allowing you to continue to accelerate that business here? Is it something around your digital offering connected? How much you\u2019re connecting? How much feet you\u2019re putting on the street? What is it that\u2019s kind of driving this acceleration and growth in that service business? And how do you see that playing out in the coming years? Dave Regnery : Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. I think I\u2019d say yes, yes and yes. Okay. It\u2019s a system of things that makes our service business great. It starts with a great operating system around our service business. We track probably 30 different KPIs. And if you went to one of our offices, you\u2019d see very detailed tracking on our service, which really leads to our success. So it\u2019s a great business. Okay? I won\u2019t disclose too much about our playbook, but we have a very detailed playbook, and you see it in our results. And I would tell you that our service business is really built around our applied systems. And as our applied systems continue to populate at an increasing rate, you could see the tail that we\u2019re getting in our service business. Think about applied system. I said this in our opening remarks. Think about it as for every dollar of equipment; think about eight times to 10 times over the life our service business. And you could now start to see that flywheel that\u2019s being created in our service business. So great business today. As Chris said, it\u2019s about a third of the enterprise growing nicely, and we\u2019re investing heavily in it, because we know there\u2019s a lot of opportunities in the future as well. Joe Ritchie : That\u2019s great to hear. And I guess, look, there\u2019s a lot of good news in this print. I know that there\u2019s some investor concern around the healthiness of the office market in 2024 and ultimately whether that\u2019s going to be a drag on growth for a lot of companies. Can you maybe just address that market specifically and how that\u2019s impacting your business or expected to in 2024? Dave Regnery : Yes, I mean, I\u2019ll speak of the Americas, and I think I said earlier, we track about 14 different verticals. Office is one of the weaker ones in 2023, and right now we\u2019re forecasting that weakness to continue in 2024. We do believe that at one point office will come back and with our direct sales force, we\u2019ll pivot to that opportunity and capture that opportunity. But right now, it\u2019s going to be soft at least through 2024. We\u2019ll see \u2013 we\u2019ll report back as the year progresses as to how that vertical is behaving. There\u2019s a lot in the news about it, so it\u2019s got some recovery to do, but it\u2019ll be soft in 2024. But that\u2019s all baked into our guide, Joe, so, that\u2019s we\u2019ve taken that into account. And I would tell you that the strength that we\u2019re seeing in some other verticals are going to be more than compensate what we\u2019re seeing in the office vertical. Joe Ritchie : Understood. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey, good morning and congrats on a very strong 2023. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Steve. Appreciate it. Steve Tusa : What are you guys embedding for price this year in general for the Americas? I mean, you said it was 3% in the quarter, I think. But what are you embedding for your 2024 guide? Chris Kuehn : Yes, Steve, it\u2019s Chris. Think about 2024 at the enterprise level around a point of price. It could be a little better than that. But as we\u2019ve seen throughout 2023, the price contribution has started to level off as we move through the quarters. We had over 6 points of price in Q1, and we ended the fourth quarter with less than 3 points of price. So there'll be some carryover into 2024, but we're dialing in at the enterprise level probably around a point, it could be a little bit better than that. Steve Tusa : Okay. And your inflation is kind of stable, I would assume? Chris Kuehn : Yes. Tier 1 is fairly stable. I appreciate the notes you put out every weekend with updates on commodities, it's a close read. At Tier 2 that happens to be inflationary, right. As we're looking at wage inflation, refrigerants are a couple of examples in that space and we continue to work with our vendors on the demand we're putting through with our order growth. So Tier 2 is a bit inflationary. Freight could be a little bit inflationary going into 2024 with a very positive, at least for us in 2023, on the cost side. But overall, I would say we're on track to get 20 to 30 basis points, price over cost in the year like we would normally target. But we remain flexible right where we see things turn and we need to make another price adjustment. We've got the business operating system to do that. Steve Tusa : So I would have, sorry, just on a follow-up on the price, I would assume that the majority of that price is still coming in commercial. So when you talk about that flat revenue number for resi, is that basically like, what's the volume kind of price split that you're assuming in resi? I guess is the question. Chris Kuehn : All in for resi, its \u2013 we're dialing in a flat year. Our guide would take into account a plus or minus low-single digits on full year revenues for resi. I'd expect price to be at that one or less kind of level for residential. Really is going to depend on what we think for the volume in the year, but not a lot of price necessarily coming through at this point. Steve Tusa : And then for 2025, are you guys going to push through the A2L price like everybody else, the 10% \u2013 10% to 15%? Chris Kuehn : Yes. We don't have a lot baked into 2024 on the conversion to 454B. If we think that does have an impact, it's certainly second half of the year, maybe fourth quarter impact. We haven't dialed in the pricing exactly on that. We'll do that as we get ready to launch our products. But it's in the ballpark of what others have said around pricing. But we'll see how the year evolves, we'll see how the demand plays with the 410A product versus the 454B transition, and we'll update as we kind of go through the year. Dave Regnery : But to be specific, Steve, this is Dave. Yes, for sure we'll see that in 2025. Steve Tusa : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. Dave Regnery : Hey, Andy, how are you? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Andy Kaplowitz : Good. How are you? Dave, can you give us some more color on the traction of your thermal management systems in EMEA and the progress you're making in bringing thermal management systems to the U.S.? Is it possible to quantify the business at this point or at least give us color on how to think about how much of your growth is coming from thermal management systems and where you are in terms of bringing it out here in the U.S.? Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, it's a great question. We continue to do very well in Europe, obviously, as you see in our results. Obviously some of that has to do with thermal management system, which is really electrification of heating. Some of it has to do with some key verticals that are very strong, like data centers and electronics. Look, we're migrating that technology to different parts of the world. It's not just in the U.S. we're also bringing it to Asia. We think there's a tremendous opportunity to electrify heating and to significantly reduce the carbon footprint for buildings and help them de-carbonize around the globe. We have already introduced several products in different regions. That trend will continue in 2024. And by the way, I don't want you to think that we've stopped innovating in Europe because that continues, it well. I think we're on our, last time I was there was like our fourth or fifth generation of what's happening there. So this is an evolving market. We believe its tremendous opportunity, excuse me, for the future, but we have solutions that have set great paybacks for our customers that, and a lot of people, I was getting asked the other day about some of the incentives around this. I'm like, yes, the incentives are great tailwinds, but these projects stand on their own. I mean there's great paybacks, if you're able to increase the efficiency by three, four times these are fantastic opportunities for Trane Technologies and they're fantastic opportunities for our customers to really help them de-carbonize and actually save money as well in the process. So we're really excited about thermal management systems and expect to see more around the world. Andy Kaplowitz : Very hopeful. And then, Dave, I wanted to double click on your comments around Asia and China in particular. As you said, China bookings barely down, I think revenue up. But as you mentioned, one of your peers had a relatively sharp deterioration in bookings in China. You mentioned the strength of your team there. Maybe talk about the durability of growth that you see there and what you're doing to sustain that growth? Dave Regnery : Yes. I'm so proud of what our team has been able to do in Asia. In fact, Thursday morning I have my 06 :30 a.m. call with the Asia team and they're super excited about what they see moving forward. I think that sometimes if you look at the headlines coming out of China specific, where you're going to see GDP down and you see what's happening in the residential space there. I would tell you that the verticals that we're really strong in continue to be strong. And it is the pharmaceutical, it is semiconductor, it is data centers. We have great offerings there and we continue to win. So we're excited about the opportunities that exist in front of us there. Andy Kaplowitz : Awesome. Keep up the good work. Dave Regnery : All right. Thanks Andy. Talk to you soon. Chris Kuehn : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Hey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Dave Regnery : Hey. Good morning, Jeff. Jeff Sprague : Hey, good morning. Sorry, I was on a few minutes late. I got kind of the end market kind of organic outlook within the six to seven. How about geographically, did you address that? How the three regions fit within the six to seven guide? Chris Kuehn : Yes. Hey, Jeff, it's Chris. What we really talked about was in the Americas and in EMEA for commercial HVAC. We can really see from our guide probably up high-single-digits for the year in the Americas with resi. We're guiding that around flat plus or minus LSD, but we're calling it flat. TK Americas markets are down around 10 points on a blended average basis. We'll outperform that. Think of that around mid-single digits down in the Americas. And then if I go to transport and EMEA markets also down low-single digits and we'll outperform those markets. And one of the slides we really like putting into the materials is really just the history of market performance versus our performance within the transport businesses and it gives us a lot of confidence with the investments we made over the years and we continue to make that we've got the ability to outperform markets again in 2024. But think of EMEA as if the market is down-low singles, then we're flat to maybe a little bit better than that. And then Asia, to Dave's point, with a great team there, we're seeing somewhere in the mid singles kind of range. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of context. Julian got pretty close to it when he asked the question before, but I'll just kind of summarize it here. Dave Regnery : And Jeff, just think about a lot of strength around commercial HVAC globally. Jeff Sprague : Yes. It sounds, Dave, that commercial HVAC price, I guess is up a little bit more. Enterprise is up 1, resi is up 1 on price. Maybe TK's got less with the volume pressures. I actually would have thought commercial price would be a little bit better than maybe kind of the 1-plus implied. Can you just maybe kind of talk to that a little bit like the price in the backlog versus new things that you're trying to do on price just to kind of react to that Tier 2 inflation you were talking about? Chris Kuehn : Yes. Jeff it's Chris. I mean, look it's early in the year, resi on the comment. We're calling it flat on a full year basis. We'll see if we get any price growth there. Maybe a little bit and even on our 1% guide for the full year, could it be better than that? Yes, we remain flexible as we move through the year and we'll look at the dynamics of cost. But right now we've got positive spread in the guide like we would target any year. But we'll be nimble to opportunities, so think of it as just the start of the year. We like putting out guidance that we can meet or exceed on a full year basis, and we'll update you as we go through. Jeff Sprague : Hey, maybe one just quick follow-up, Dave, a lot of your earlier comments on the call kind of about making your own luck, right, with the salesforce and everything. You may have heard one of your competitors sort of gave up on the IRA yesterday. Like, be nice if something happens, but we don't see it. Like, what's your view on really how some of the stimulus might work its way through the system and are you actually seeing any tangible benefits? Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, we're still holding out hope, okay, look, we are seeing some of it in the commercial space with the 179D tax credit, so that is driving some tailwinds, okay. On the resi side, yes, that's been a little bit muted. We're still hopeful that that could work through. We're still marketing to the customers about heat pumps and the importance of heat pumps and how we can help them. The key is going to be on IRA, and I've said this in the past, Jeff. You got to make it simple, right. So make it simple. It's complex. Don't let that complexity make its way to the customer because they won't understand it. So we've been really good with taking the complexity out of some of these more intricate policies, and that's going to be the key to success. So the short answer is we still believe it's a tailwind. It's going to be a tailwind for both residential and for commercial. We just hope that the pipe starts opening in residential sooner versus later. Jeff Sprague : Great. Thank you for that color. I appreciate it. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Jeff. Chris Kuehn : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Dave Regnery : Hey, Deane, how are you? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Deane Dray : I'm doing real well. Thank you. So what has surprised you about the resi inventory normalization process and how long do you think it might extend into 2024? Dave Regnery : What may be surprised me a little bit is the amount of time it's taken to burn off. I think you heard me in our third quarter call was we thought we'd be complete in Q4 and that's \u2013 that's not the case. So this will burn off eventually. Right now it's going to go in through at least the first quarter, really the first half. But look, we're optimistic on residential, it's a great business. It will snap back. It is, I've always said for a long time now think of resi as a GDP-plus business that hasn't changed. And the inventory in the independent wholesale distributor channel will start to align to demand. It's the first quarter, I remind you that. So we'll see what happens here as we get into peak season. So we'll give you an update as we get to our first quarter earnings call. Deane Dray : That's all good to hear. And then just data center has come up multiple times already and where the fastest growth is happening is in liquid cooling. And I know you all made what looks to be a great investment in liquid stack. The business is still really fragmented and do you see opportunities where you can invest further there because that's where you're seeing plus 30% growth for the next several years in that technology, and you have a right to be in that business and a right to win, but you'll have to invest. So just what are the expectations? Dave Regnery : Yes, I mean, Deane, I appreciate your insights in emerging cooling. I think you did a great piece on that so appreciate that educating really the industry on the possibilities that we have with immersion cooling. Look, we\u2019re still very bullish. Our view hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019re working through the technology, okay really on the fluid itself. So that\u2019s continuing to evolve. But we also believe it\u2019s a big opportunity. And if you think about it right, I mean, think about data centers. It\u2019s a massive market today. Think about the growth rates that\u2019s going to happen over the next five years. And whether you choose the high teen\u2019s compound annual growth rate or you\u2019re in the 20s, it\u2019s a large growth number. And the technology is going to continue to evolve. And I think that immersion cooling could be one of those technologies of the future. And we\u2019re certainly right in the middle of it, as you said, and we\u2019re going to continue to be bullish on that. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. Dave Regnery : All right, thanks, Deane. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. So today you\u2019ve been fielding a few questions on price. So let\u2019s have a couple more pricing questions. What\u2019s really kind of struck me is that some of your competitors, some of your larger competitors are actually going out with very aggressive price increases and really guiding for pretty significant realized price increases. And your message is very, very different. So in your experience, have you seen situations where the market has this divergence on price and does it tend to lead to share shifts? It just feels like it\u2019s unsustainable, this gap here. So any thoughts? And then just kind of a sub question to that would be the service fleets. You\u2019ve got obviously, a lot of labor inflation to deal with there. I mean, would you expect service pricing to be better than that 1%? Dave Regnery : Yes. Let me just start, and I\u2019m going to let Chris talk about price. Nigel, I think it\u2019s always important to look at the history on pricing. So if you remember, we were really early with pricing. Right. And that\u2019s really because of our business operating system. We were able to see around that corner. So you really have to go back in history and kind of look at what we did early on versus maybe some of our competitors are catching up a little bit. So, Chris, I\u2019ll let you answer the rest of the question. Chris Kuehn : Hi, I think that\u2019s where it starts, Dave. Right. 2021, 2022, even 2023, we really saw where we led on price there. So, we\u2019re being strategic, Nigel, as we think about that again, the 1% guide for the year right now, it\u2019s early in the year. We\u2019ll see how we do as we move throughout the year. But services, what we would look at is, we look at wage inflation, look at the demand out there in the marketplace and make sure we\u2019re pricing appropriately. We\u2019re also not there, and we\u2019ve said this for many years, we\u2019re really not out there to try to gouge our customers. What we were trying to do is offset inflation a few years ago with price. We want customers for life. And so we\u2019re going to think about that as we move through the process here. But we don\u2019t see pricing moving backwards here in the businesses. But again, the 1% guide, it\u2019s just early in the year, we\u2019ll update you as we move throughout it. Nigel Coe : Okay. And there sounds, obviously, you guide him for about $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion of capital deployment in 2024, consistent with what you did in 2023. Obviously tough to know how much of that\u2019s going to be buybacks versus M&A. But as you do more M&A, the amort is going to be increasingly a burden to your GAAP EPS. I know I asked this question last year about a move to cash EPS, but is that something that\u2019s under consideration? Chris Kuehn : We\u2019ll give it some thought as we move throughout. You\u2019re right on amortization. It\u2019s actually really the main driver with the Nuvolo acquisition that we wanted to call out with higher amortization, non-cash accounting rule based shorter lived assets in terms of how you amortize those with a high technology business, that\u2019s a youngish company. But yes, we\u2019ll watch it as we go forward. I really like our cash EPS in 2023. I calculated that after knowing your question was going to come up with 103% on cash and net income. I like our cash EPS. We have lots of opportunities still within our working capital, especially in inventory to make sure we have that level set, and that\u2019ll be a nice opportunity for us on cash going forward. But as we move out into the future years, right at some point we\u2019re going to start comping against the Trane acquisition amortization. Right. So as we move out into the future years, we may see some of that starting to roll off as well. Not so much here in 2024, but as we look out in the future, we could start seeing that being a tailwind, let\u2019s say, on operating income. But that\u2019s why we like also showing the EBITDA margins for investors. Right. It takes out that noise on the amortization and just gives another metric to look at. Nigel Coe : Right. Okay. Thanks for the details, Chris. Appreciate it. Chris Kuehn : You\u2019re welcome. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Nigel. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hi guys, good morning. Dave Regnery : Hey Andrew, how are you? Andrew Obin : Hey, how are you? Just a question on CMS, I think you highlighted it to us back last year and my understanding that it sort of qualifies ITC, I think was clarified back in November, and I think there are potential more tax incentives. Does this change the game on TMS in North America? Or it\u2019s know, just more arrows in your quiver and just to work with your customers and to provide a good solution for them? Is that a game changer? That\u2019s a question I guess. Dave Regnery : I certainly think it is a game changer, when you start thinking about thermal management systems and electrification of heating and being able to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of a building and have a very, very efficient system versus a conventional system. So, I think if you wrap all together I\u2019d say sure, absolutely. It\u2019s a game changer. It\u2019s making its way around the world and as we launch it in different regions and continue to see more of that in the future. Andrew Obin : Yes, I guess I was referring to is the tax credit a game changer? No. I know you\u2019re excited about the technology. Dave Regnery : So I think any policy or tax credit become tailwinds. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the only driver. I think the main driver of these systems is very, very efficient, they\u2019re very sustainable and they have great paybacks with or without any kind of policy or tax credit. Tax credit will be a benefit to it, but it\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s driving. Andrew Obin : That makes sense. And then as we think about inventory in the channel and the refrigerant change both on residential and light commercial, how do you see, I think you addressed inventory on residential, but how do you see it playing out on light commercial? And I know it\u2019s sort of hard to pin down what qualifies as light commercial. And then the second question does it introduce different seasonality first half versus second half for the unitary business? Thank you. Dave Regnery : Yes, I really don\u2019t. I think last year the EPA came out and kind of clarified so you can manufacture to the end of this year and then you have a complete through 2025 to do the sell through. We see that as all that was a good ruling by the EPA. We support that it gives the channel time to do proper sell through. So, we see that all as possible. I don\u2019t see any different dynamic there on the light unitary and I\u2019m defining light unitary as less than 25 tons. So it\u2019ll really be the same dynamic that we\u2019re seeing in res. Andrew Obin : And how big is under 25 tons for you? Dave Regnery : It\u2019s a large portion of our unitary business, but we also have this great applied business, Andrew, that\u2019s even bigger. Andrew Obin : I appreciate it. Thank you. Dave Regnery : All right. Thanks. Operator : Our last question today will come from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Appreciate it. Thanks. Since you talked earlier about some of the digital investments you\u2019re making this year, and you appointed a Chief Digital Officer in December, which seemed like a pretty significant milestone. Just to help us understand, is there more of a digital transformation opportunity internally over the next few years, or is this more about adding offerings to your quiver? Maybe you can get a little bit deeper into some of the focus areas for those digital investments, cyber, digital twin, et cetera. Dave Regnery : Yes. I would tell you we\u2019ve been in the digital space for a long time. Okay? So digital twins are not new to us. Connected solutions are not new to us. I think that bringing Riaz on board, which is he\u2019s just a fantastic talent and early days, is just doing a great job. It\u2019s just creating a huge focus, and we believe that digitalization is a big part of our future, and Riaz is going to help us see the opportunities that exist. You take with Riaz, You take the Nuvolo that we\u2019ve added on, you think about what we\u2019re doing with digital twins. There\u2019s a lot of opportunities there. And you think about the level that we\u2019re seeing in our service business today, the growth rates we\u2019re seeing. Just think of that even getting stronger with a digital application in the future. Noah Kaye : Appreciate that Dave, maybe the last question. I think around this time last year, you shared with us your view of where backlog would end. You said greater than $6 billion exiting 2023. $6.9 billion. So, you clearly surpassed that. Can you share with us today where you see it ending 2024? Dave Regnery : Yes, I would just say that expect our backlog to remain elevated for several periods. Look, we\u2019re at $6.9 billion right now. It\u2019s the same level we were at when we entered 2023. So it\u2019s very strong. I think one thing I would say is that the composition of the backlog is changing quite a bit. And as we went through 2023, it\u2019s now like 90% plus commercial HVAC. And think of that as applied systems, which has that long service tail associated with it. So a lot of demand in the verticals, data centers, et cetera, that really require applied systems. So, we\u2019re very happy with our performance. Noah Kaye : Appreciate that, caller. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Sure. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. I\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining today\u2019s call. As always, we\u2019ll be around to answer any questions you have in the coming days and weeks. We\u2019ll also be attending a number of the upcoming conferences as we enter the big conference season, and we hope to have the opportunity to connect with many of you there soon. Have a great day, and we\u2019ll talk to you soon. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. David Regnery : Thanks, Zac, and thanks, everyone, for joining today's call. As we begin, I'd like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which drives our engaging, uplifting culture and enables our differentiated financial results over time. Our purpose is centered on creating a more sustainable world, and our strategy is aligned to powerful mega trends like energy efficiency, decarbonization and digital transformation. Customer demand continues to increase as the need to address climate change becomes more urgent. We need creative solutions and game-changing innovation to bend the curve on global warming and that's where Trane Technologies leads. Our relentless innovation, proven business operating system and high-performing culture enables us to consistently deliver a leading growth profile, strong margins and powerful free cash flow. The end result is strong value creation across the board for our customers, our shareholders, our employees and for the planet. Please turn to Slide #4. In the first quarter, we extended our track record of strong execution. Our global teams delivered robust performance across the board. Quarterly bookings of more than $5 billion were at an all-time high and up 17% organically. Organic revenues were up 14%. Adjusted operating margins were up 230 basis points and adjusted EPS was up 38%. First quarter bookings strength was again led by our Commercial HVAC businesses globally, which were up over 20% with growth in more than 30% in equipment and mid-teens in services. Bookings in our Americas Commercial HVAC business were once again a standout, up 30% with more than 40% growth in equipment and more than 15% in services. Booking strength was broad-based with growth in nearly all vertical markets. We delivered exceptional bookings growth across our applied solutions, leveraging the power of our direct sales force, deep customer relationships and leading innovation to capitalize on increasing project complexity in high-growth verticals. Our Commercial HVAC pipeline remains robust around the world, and we see tremendous growth opportunities well into the future. Our strong growth profile provides us with excellent optionality to accelerate key investments in 2024 while delivering strong leverage, EPS and free cash flow. And we put a number of high ROI investments in flight in the first quarter. With a focus on future growth, these investments include product innovation, increased capacity, sales and service excellence, digital and automation. Our bookings performance further strengthens our position for 2024 and increasingly for 2025. Q1 ending backlog of $7.7 billion is up 10% from year-end 2023. And we increased our backlog for 2025 and beyond by $800 million to a total of $1.8 billion, increasing visibility to future growth. Based on our Q1 results and expectations for continued strong performance, we're raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Chris will cover the details in a few minutes. Please go to Slide #5. Demand for our innovative solutions continues to be exceptional with a book-to-bill of 120% on strong organic revenue growth of 14%.  In the Americas segment, our Commercial HVAC business delivered strong performance across the board. Bookings were up 30% in the quarter and up over 60% on a 3-year stack, led by our applied solutions portfolio, which we estimate carries an 8 to 10 multiplier of higher-margin services revenue over the life of the equipment. Backlog for applied solutions continues to grow, which bodes well for future growth. Commercial HVAC revenues were up mid-20s with more than 35% growth in equipment and mid-teens growth in services. The compounding of services revenue year after year provides strong growth in good times and is resilient in more challenging macro conditions. We're investing heavily in sales and services excellence programs, strengthen our business for the long term. Turning to residential. Bookings were down low single digits and revenues were up low single digits. The business performed stronger than our initial expectations for Q1, and we're cautiously optimistic moving forward. Our transport businesses performed as expected, with bookings down low single digits and revenues down mid-teens. While we see the down cycle in transport as modest overall, the business is facing tough comps from 2023, a plus 20% growth comp in the first half and a down 20% growth comp in the second half, which impacts the OpEx in the near term. In 2024, we expect to see a soft first half and a strong second half. Turning to EMEA. The region performed in line with our expectations. Commercial HVAC bookings and revenues were strong, up low teens and up high single digits, respectively, while transport bookings and revenues were down low single digits. The book-to-bill was very strong at approximately 120%. Turning to Asia. The team delivered strong performance consistent with our expectations for the quarter. China remains very strong, with bookings up more than 20% and revenues up high teens. Asia's book-to-bill was also very strong at approximately 120%. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Christopher Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #6. This slide provides a snapshot of our performance in the first quarter and highlight strong execution top to bottom. Organic revenues were up 14%, adjusted EBITDA and operating margins were up 200 basis points and 230 basis points, respectively, and adjusted EPS was up 38%. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in equipment and services, both up low teens. Our high-performance flywheel continues to pay dividends, with relentless investments in innovation, driving strong top line growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. Please turn to Slide #7. At the enterprise level, we delivered robust volume growth with strong incrementals, positive price realization and productivity that more than offset inflation. In our Americas segment, we delivered about 12 points of volume and about 3 points price, with our Americas Commercial HVAC business delivering very strong volume growth of approximately 20 points. Strong adjusted operating margin expansion of 240 basis points was driven by strength in our Commercial HVAC business, which more than offset the expected impact from revenue decline in our transport business. In our EMEA segment, we delivered about 3 points of volume and about 1 point of price with stronger volume in our Commercial HVAC business. Adjusted operating margins were up 30 basis points for the segment and stronger when you consider the impact of acquisitions and FX in the quarter. Excluding FX currency losses related to the devaluation in the Egyptian pound in the quarter, EMEA EBITDA margins would have been 19.5%. The Asia segment delivered mid-teens revenue growth almost exclusively from higher volumes. Strong volume, productivity and modest price contributed to 310 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. We reinvested heavily back into each business in the first quarter and expect to ramp these investments through the year to drive growth well into the future. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide #8. Our end market segment and business unit outlook is largely unchanged from our Q4 earnings call with a couple of notable differences. First, our Americas Commercial HVAC business had a very strong quarter, stronger than we expected despite a tough comp of mid-teens revenue growth in the first quarter of 2023. We're encouraged by the strong start for the business, especially when you take into account the exceptional 30% bookings growth and 125% book-to-bill ratio on mid-20s revenue growth in the quarter. We expect the Americas Commercial HVAC business to remain strong throughout 2024 versus increasingly tough comps from 2023 as we move throughout the year. Second, our residential business performed stronger than we expected in the first quarter. We expect the business to be down modestly on continued destocking, and we believe the EPA clarification on sell-through helped to mitigate some of the independent wholesale distributors concern heading into this season. While we're pleased with the results, the first quarter for residential is typically a very small percentage of the year and doesn't provide a sufficient read through to the balance of the season. We believe it's prudent to move through Q2 and gain more visibility before extrapolating too much from Q1. All other businesses performed as expected, and the outlook for the year are unchanged. We provided additional details on the slide for your reference. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris? Christopher Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #9. Our initial 2024 guidance reflected optimism about key end markets and our ability to outperform. While we're only 1 quarter in, our exceptional bookings, revenues and backlog in our Commercial HVAC businesses strengthen our conviction that 2024 will be another year of robust top line and bottom line growth.  We're raising our organic revenue guidance by 2 percentage points to 8% to 9% from 6% to 7% prior. We're also raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.30 at the midpoint and raising the low end of our guidance range above the high end of our prior guidance range. Our new adjusted EPS guidance range is narrowed to $10.40 to $10.50, up from $10 to $10.30 prior. Embedded in our guidance is our philosophy around our value creation flywheel, which builds in relentless high levels of business reinvestment to drive end market outgrowth, healthy leverage and strong free cash flow. We expect to see investments continue to ramp in the second quarter and into the back half of the year, accompanied by leading growth and strong incrementals. We continue to expect about 1 point of growth from M&A in 2024 with a negative impact of approximately $30 million to adjusted operating income for the full year or a negative impact of about 5 points to reported leverage versus organic leverage. The impact is primarily related to the technology acquisition, Nuvolo which carries noncash accelerated intangibles amortization of approximately $25 million, plus year 1 acquisition and integration-related costs. We also expect a negative impact to revenues of about 1 percentage point from FX in 2024. FX is expected to offset the point of M&A revenue growth on a reported basis meaning our organic and reported revenue growth guidance is now the same at 8% to 9% for 2024. There's no change to our organic leverage target of 25% plus for the year, consistent with our stated long-term target. Turning to cash. We had a strong start to free cash flow generation in the first quarter, and we expect 2024 to be another year of free cash flow conversion of 100% or greater. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 8.5% and adjusted EPS of approximately $3.05. Please see Page 17 for additional information that may be helpful for modeling purposes. Please go to Slide #10. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A to further improve long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide #11, and I'll provide an update on our 2024 capital deployment. Year-to-date through April, we've deployed $540 million in cash with $190 million to dividends and $350 million to share repurchases. We have $2.1 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, providing us with strong optionality as our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. Our M&A pipeline remains active. We continue to see potential opportunities for value-accretive M&A as we did in 2023 where we made key, strategic investments to accelerate our progress across energy services and digital solutions, industrial process cooling and precision temperature control technology. For 2024, we expect to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet give us excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave.  Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please go to Slide #13. As discussed, our transport performance in Q1 was as expected, and there's no change to our outlook for the year. The overall markets are expected to be down modestly, and we expect to outperform in both regions. We've continued to provide this slide in the deck for your reference. Please turn to Slide #14. We operate our transport business for the long term. And while we're moving through a modest downturn in 2024, this is a great business with a bright future. ACT projects a strong trailer market rebound from 2024 into 2025, up 19% and project continued growth through their forecast horizon in 2029. We have a diversified transport business globally with opportunities to grow across the portfolio, with leading innovation, strong execution through our business operating system and a world-class dealer network, we're well positioned to outperform in any market environment. Please go to Slide #15. In summary, we are well positioned to drive differentiated growth and value over time. Our leading innovation, proven business operating system and unmatched culture enables us to consistently deliver top quartile financial performance over the long term while continuing to reinvest in our business. And I believe our best days are ahead. We have the team, the strategy and the track record to deliver a leading performance in 2024 and differentiated shareholder returns over the long term. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Andrew Kaplowitz : Dave, can you give us a little more color into your order momentum and backlog growth? You obviously enjoyed significant acceleration orders and you mentioned strength in applied. So can you give us any more color to how much of the continued Americas orders acceleration is coming from data centers. Do you think you can continue to grow your backlog from here? And maybe your thoughts on the duration of this order cycle if it is, in fact, data center-led? David Regnery : Yes. Thanks for the question, Andy, good question. Look, in the quarter, we saw a broad-based growth -- and it wasn't concentrated necessarily in any 1 vertical. I mean, we certainly had strength in data centers. We certainly have strengthen in education, health care, high-tech industrials. It was almost hard for us to find a vertical that we didn't grow in. We did have a bit of weakness, and I guess you would say, conventional office and some in lodging. But for the most part, it was broad-based growth, and it was really on a global level. So a lot of strength in our Commercial HVAC businesses. And the good news is our pipeline is also very strong. So this would be before an order actually comes in to be a booking, this is what our sales teams are working on. That continues to be very strong as well. So look, it's a lot of innovation. I'm certainly proud of what the team's been able to deliver, and we're executing at a very high level right now. Andrew Kaplowitz : David, definitely, I can appreciate that. So on that note, organic incremental margins continue to trend higher than your 25%. Given the strength in your markets and the overall ability to execute, why isn't 30% or 35% as you've been able to record for a while now, the new 25% for Trane? And then where are you on, let's say, the slope of productivity projects that you've been undertaking? Because we know you've been really focused on productivity after not being able to do as much during the pandemic. Christopher Kuehn : Andy, it's Chris. I'll start and then Dave may jump in. So as we think about the first quarter, investments back into the business began to ramp really stronger into February and March than, say, the start of the quarter and our run rate exiting Q1 is stronger than when we started. The pipeline for investments continues to grow. And these are across multiple categories. So to your question, we really like the long-term framework of the 25% or better incrementals. That's what we're continuing to guide for 2024. But the investment pipeline and where we can see the market outgrowth here and the order rates and the revenue rates, I think, just tells us we want to keep investing back in the business. Think of these investments, again, around innovation, sales and service investments that Dave talked about in the comments. These are upfront tools as well as people investments, making sure we've got capacity investments, automation in the factory; digital, the list goes on, and we want to make sure we're always funding back into the business. On the productivity side, we're not there yet. We're getting better on the gross productivity, but there's still more opportunities for us going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Scott Davis : Guys just following up on Andy's question a little bit. But can you mark to market where you're at on data center capability? I know you made that investment in liquid stack. I think it's called -- do you have kind of -- are you developing kind of soup to nuts capabilities in the data center to be able to handle some of these newer, hotter chips? David Regnery : Yes. Great question, Scott.  I think we've been very well positioned in data center vertical for a long time. And I think you know this, but technology tends to move pretty fast in this vertical compared to others. And we're certainly aware of these new technologies that are being developed really at the terminal side of cooling. So think of that as direct cooling to the chip or think of it as emerging cooling at the rack level.  One of the things that we do really, really well at Trane Technologies is we think about systems. And if you think about a data center's cooling systems, you need to think about the entire system. So some of it certainly is what we would call the terminal side, and that's what we just referred to. But these systems also require sophisticated air handling. They also require high efficiency chillers, and we look at the entire system to really help the customer think through the entire energy needs for the whole data center. The other thing that's really emerging, you're going to hear more about this is we think of the data center, think of it as a thermal management system. So I know you know this, but when you're cooling a space, you're removing heat from it. Data centers have a lot of heat. What do you do with that heat that you're removing? Conventional thinking would be it gets emitted back out into the atmosphere. But how can you repurpose that heat, and we've done some projects still early stages here, where we're creating district heating loops from the heat that would normally just be wasted and reusing it as an asset. So it's a very dynamic space. It's obviously growing at a nice clip. It will grow at a nice rate for the continued future and we're spot in the middle of it, and it's always been a very strong vertical and it will be in the future. Scott Davis : That makes sense, Dave. And just a little bit of a pie in the sky here. But does it make more sense to think about you guys in a data center partnering with somebody like Vertiv or explicitly competing against them because it seems like you both have very different capabilities, but obviously overlap on some critical apps there. So how do you guys think about that opportunity when you think about these giant, giant about like a 1-gigawatt data center, something where the engineering capabilities would presumably almost rely on maybe more than 1 supplier, not just 1. Is that accurate, Dave? Or am I thinking about it wrong? David Regnery : Yes. I wouldn't call out any particular company here, but I would tell you that we have technology partners that we work with because you're spot on. It's a cooling system, right. It's no different than think about a system that exists within a building, right, we may not have every component, but we would have a partner that would have that component, but we would help integrate it into a system that would be operating in an efficient way for the customer. Scott Davis : Best of luck guys, congrats on this start for the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Julian Mitchell : Maybe just a first question on the organic sales guide for the year. So it looks like the first half, you're up maybe about 11% based on the guidance, the full year you've got up sort of high singles, so second half is there at maybe 6% or so. Is the way to think about that and understand we haven't yet seen cooling season and so forth. But is the way to think about that revenue guide framework, it's a big slowdown in commercial HVAC versus Q1 because of the extremely tough comps -- because I would have thought resi and TK would look better year-on-year sales in the back half versus the first half. So with the total enterprise sort of going from 11% to 6%, is it just really that Commercial HVAC piece just battling the tough comps? Christopher Kuehn : Julian, it's Chris. I'll start. It is tough comps for Commercial HVAC and especially the Americas. They're going to have a great year on a full year basis. But when you think about go back a year in the first quarter of 2023, the growth there in Commercial HVAC Americas is around mid-teens. And then by the fourth quarter of last year, the growth was mid-20s. So think of that as a 10-point increase in terms of growth and revenue throughout last year. So the comps do get tougher as we work through 2024. But again, they're going to have an outstanding year this year. But you're right, it is a bit of the tough comps in Commercial HVAC. Transport Americas, we do expect the second half to be stronger than the first half. That is also due to tough comps. The business was up 20% the first half of '23, down 20% in the second half of '23. So the comps get easier as we go throughout the year. But you're right, you've dialed it in a little bit there. And look, we feel comfortable with the guide that we put out there now and our ability to meet or exceed that guide on the full year. Let us get through another quarter of results here in the second quarter. As you know, the first quarter within Trane Technologies is generally our smallest quarter of the year. Let us get through the second quarter. We'll have a better insight on the second half of the year at that time. We feel very confident with the guide that we just released today. Julian Mitchell : And maybe just my follow-up would be on the sort of price and price/mix outlook. So I think in the first quarter, maybe price was about a 2-point tailwind to revenue. Maybe remind us kind of what you're embedding for the year as a whole. And has there been any shift in the expectations on the sort of price/mix tailwind in light commercial and resi HVAC from the refrigerant change in the sort of various EPA movements on that? Christopher Kuehn : Julian. So in the first quarter, at an enterprise level, we delivered about 3 points of price, those comps get tougher as we move throughout the year as we start getting to a little bit more of a normalization of price. Think of the full year now, we're guiding to about 2 points of price, was certainly a question on the call that we had a few months ago in our full year guide on price. We thought we could maybe do a little bit better there. And delivering on Q1 gives us the confidence to raise our full year revenue by 2 points. Think of that as a point of price and a point of volume. In the Americas, we led with price in the Americas, that's generally been the model within the company and within that Commercial HVAC would have been stronger. As we think about price/mix and maybe inflation a bit, we're very confident in terms of delivering the 20 or 30 basis points, maybe better in terms of price/cost, price versus inflation on the full year. That's one of the best parts, if I think about our business operating system has been our ability to remain nimble with pricing. We've got the right inputs. And as we think about commodities and how they kind of play out over the next year to 2 years, remaining nimble in terms of pricing is something that [indiscernible] offering. Your comment on residential. We're not -- Dave, do you want to cover that? David Regnery : Yes, we don't have a lot of 454B at least in the Americas, built into our guide, okay. We're obviously ready from a product standpoint, we'll be launching those products as we go through the year, but we're not anticipating a lot of volume in 2024, and we'll see how the year progresses for 2025. On -- one of the things, too, on 454B is, I saw a couple of pre comments come out about being a new refrigerant. I just want to make sure everyone's clear. We've been using 454B in Europe for over 2 years now. So this is not a new refrigerant for Trane Technologies. We're very comfortable with the refrigerant and we've had in our portfolio for some time. A lot of it's baked in America [indiscernible]. Operator : Your next question comes from Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Gautam Khanna : Great results. I wanted to ask if you could opine again on what you think happens with resi -- average resi pricing next year given the 454 transition. You still think it's up kind of 10% to 15%? Or just how would you characterize... David Regnery : It's a good question, Gautam. Look, we don't anticipate a lot of 454B product in 2024, as I just said. That will obviously ramp up in 2025. We're not projecting 2025 yet. From a pricing standpoint, we're going to -- we'll announce pricing when we release the products. But I think what you've heard from others is probably in the ballpark as to what to expect from a pricing standpoint. We're going to see how the year plays out, okay? We don't see a big pre-buy happening in -- at the end of the year for 410. Maybe you'll get maybe a minor one with some high runners. So it's really going to be -- nobody wants to get stuck with inventory. And it's just -- we have to watch out to see how the balance plays out, and we'll give you an update as we move through the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Joseph Ritchie : Yes, stellar results. Just -- maybe just taking it back to the data center discussion for a second. Is there a way to maybe parse out or range or on a relative basis, kind of give us like any sense for your dollar content on a data center and what the opportunity is? David Regnery : Yes. You start talking about averages, which are always dangerous, Joe. I mean I've read reports where people have estimated the 3% to 5% range. In some cases, I'd say they're in the ballpark, and then you get into some hyperscale that may have a different configuration. But it's not that far off. Look, we're very strong in this vertical. We have been for a while, and it's going to have a lot of growth in the future, which is exciting. But understand, it's one vertical of many verticals that we play in. And in the first quarter, we had broad-based strategy. So it wasn't just focused on data centers. Joseph Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful, Dave. And maybe the follow-on question for the other things that are strong, right, you had an electrical peer throughout a $1.2 trillion mega project number today. It seems like there's just a lot of investment on the comp. At the same time, like you do have some other funding like ESSER funding as an example that might be coming down. So just maybe high level, just talk to us about what you see in terms of like your quoting activity? Or what do you see coming through the pipe over the next couple of years? David Regnery : Yes. I'll start with mega projects. I mean I think that mega projects are happening in verticals that we've always been very strong in. So it's always difficult to say what's additive versus what's ongoing strength in a particular vertical. That said, our team is tracking over 300 mega projects. And we've had some orders that have been received. However, the majority are still in the pipeline as these are typically longer duration projects to close. A lot of these projects that are deemed as mega projects are global in nature, which gives us really a competitive advantage with our direct sales force because we're able to triage decision makers and provide technical support in different parts of the world. So well in tune to what's happening with mega projects. As far as ESSER goes, look, ESSER funding, the way it's designed right now, you can take an order up until September of this year, and it has to be fulfilled within the first quarter of 2026. And we've done very well with ESSER funding, but we don't believe that the whole education vertical stops after ESSER funding. There's also IRA funding that's available. And there's, of course, the municipal bond process that's always been very robust in the past. So look, the education vertical has always been strong for Trane Technologies, expected to be strong in the future as well. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. C. Stephen Tusa : Some very nice orders. Congrats. Can you just talk about what you're seeing on applied versus light commercial, just orders and revenues? David Regnery : Yes. I mean, obviously, in the Americas, which I think is where your question is focused, we were very strong in equipment overall. I mean our order rate for equipment was up over 40%. And we saw strength really in both applied and unitary. And in the past, I've said applied has been a lot stronger. This time, they were pretty close. So there's a lot of strength out there. And that makes sense because if you look, we had broad-based growth across really almost all verticals. And a lot of those verticals are served with different applications. So it was very strong. C. Stephen Tusa : And I guess what are -- are there particular verticals in like commercial that you think your gaining share in because your main peer had orders down pretty dramatically there. David Regnery : Yes. I don't -- I can't speak to a competitor because you get comps from 1 year to another. I would just tell you that it broad-based, you're going to have some verticals that are more on the applied side but some verticals are more on the unitary side. So think about education, it's probably a 50-50 split. Conventional office typically tends to be more on the unitary side, not always, but tends to be -- retail will be on the rooftop side. But look, we're very happy with the performance we had in Q1. And I don't remember a quarter when I was talking about 40% order growth and it was as broad-based as we saw in Q1. C. Stephen Tusa : Right. And then just 1 last one, on resi. Can you just break down the -- in that business for the quarter, just the price/mix and volume for the quarter? Christopher Kuehn : Yes, Steve. Revenues were up low single digits, think of them as very low numbers, contributing price volume in terms of residential. It's just -- we start getting a [ lot of ] small numbers there in up low single digits. It did better than we expected, as Dave talked to earlier, think of price is really de minimis, maybe volume was up around 1% for resi. But let's see, we're just starting the cooling season here. Let's get through another quarter, and we'll see how the year plays out for residential. Operator : Your next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Deane Dray : So those were pretty positive comments coming out of China. So could you kind of give us a sense of where the demand is, the outlook? Because we have heard some mixed signals about at best stabilizing, but it sounds like you're seeing some pretty strong growth. David Regnery : Yes. The team there continues to execute at a very high level, very seasoned team, been in place for -- they have a lot of tenure with the company, a lot of strength in pharmaceutical, health care, high-tech, data centers, which is really where our portfolio plays well with our applied systems. Very happy with what we saw. Now China is a small percentage of the enterprise in the 5% range, but a lot of strength there, which is encouraging. Deane Dray : That's real helpful. And then can you give us a sense of where you stand on your services mix, refresh us on the target? And how do you think that plays out for this year? David Regnery : It's a great question. I was telling, Chris, I think we're going to -- in the Americas, we always said our service business was 50% service and 50% equipment. But with our equipment growth, we got to go back and look at the calculation.  Look, we had a very strong services business in the Q1 at a global level, it was up in the low teens. In the Americas, it was up over 15% and there's a compounding effect that's going on there. And this is the sixth year where we've had service growth of low single digits. So it's -- we've invested heavily in this. I think it's one of the areas that sometimes gets underappreciated in Trane Technologies. But I'd tell you, it's 1/3 of our business. It's very resilient, and it is an enabler and that team continues to execute at a very high level and expect it in the future as well. Christopher Kuehn : Deane, the 6 years, up high single digits growth in services, last year was up double digits, and Dave keeps pressuring us to kind of move to the double digits. But I'll tell you, it's -- the resiliency as he called out and we like the margins there and a nice start to the year in the business. Operator : Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Nigel Coe : And I don't often say this, but a great quarter, fantastic results. I guess -- I'm sorry, I've been going back and forth on the different calls here. So maybe just step back, I mean, what surprised you to the upside this quarter? I mean, obviously, organic came a lot better, really strong Commercial HVAC trends. But specifically, what really surprised you during this quarter? Was it just backlog conversion? Anything -- any color there would be helpful. David Regnery : Yes. I think there was really 2 things that were to the upside. One was our commercial HVAC business in the Americas. It really performed better than expectations. Just a lot of demand for our innovative products and the team executed extremely well. The other upside was in our residential business. Look, we thought that was a business that was going to be down low single digits, maybe even mid-single digits in the beginning of the year for Q1 with destocking that was going to occur. I think that where we kind of got help there was the EPA coming out with their clarification on the sell-through for 410 and gave confidence to our independent wholesale distributors that they should be stocking up and getting ready for the season, which is what we saw. So those would be the 2 big areas that kind of where we saw the upside. The rest of the world really played out the way we thought. Europe, strength in our Commercial HVAC business continues. Our Thermo King business, look, it's going to be a modest downturn in Thermo King in the year, we'll do better than the markets, but that's exactly what we saw play out in the first quarter. Asia, pretty much as we thought, maybe a little bit stronger in our commercial HVAC business, but it really played out as expected in the rest of the world. Nigel Coe : And then my follow-on is just the stand out here is just the resilience of the Commercial HVAC orders and backlog, especially in the backdrop of such weak [indiscernible] ABI et cetera. So just wondering, are there -- obviously, there's pockets of strength in data center, et cetera, but is there increasing evidence of just more proactive replacement demand, CO2 emission targets really driving demand? Any color? David Regnery : Yes. I can't answer that specifically. I haven't looked that way. But I would tell you that we continue to see a very strong pipeline. And so this would be what our sales force is actually are working on that they're putting in our CRM systems. And that remains very robust. So there's a lot of activity out there. And I hear the disconnect, too, when you look at ABI or some of the other macro numbers, you just have to look at -- we don't look at just one, okay. You have to look at several and some are aligned to one vertical versus another vertical. But look, we saw a very strong demand broad-based and the pipelines are still strong. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Andrew Obin : Can you  hear me? David Regnery : I can. Andrew Obin : Just a question. As we think about cooling for semiconductor plants and data centers, right? It seems that the scale of the project, it's going up. And the question I have for that, a, does this provide an opportunity to provide more sophisticated solution to your customers and also to capture more value to Trane? And second, what are you doing to your aftermarket support organization to take advantage of that? David Regnery : Yes. We talked a little bit about data centers earlier. But look, this is a vertical that tends to move faster from a technology adoption than others. And we're working closely with partners and data center customers to understand what the trends are, and I would tell you, we're right in the middle of it. In the data center, Andrew, look at the entire system, okay? We like to look at things at a system level. And you're hearing a lot right now on the terminal side of data center. So that would be like direct cooling to the chip or immersion cooling. We look at the entire system. So the air handling side of it as well as the sophisticated chillers, the high-efficiency chillers with next-gen refrigerants that are also required. I think where you're going to hear a little bit more is on the thermal management side of a data center. They produce a lot of heat that heat is taken out of the data center, how can you repurpose it. And that's some of the technology that we're in discussions, kind of at a thought leadership level as to how we can take an asset and -- or heat and turn it into an asset in the future. Andrew Obin : Yes. My question, I think, was more basic. I was just thinking that these systems are bigger and more complex, they're more energy hungry. So more opportunity for -- more need for your customers to partner up with you and more opportunity for you to sort of provide these packaged energy-saving solution. That's where I was going. David Regnery : You're right on, Andrew, all opportunities, and it's a growing vertical. Andrew Obin : Got you. And then just a follow-up on M&A. You guys have been pretty active over the past couple of years. But looking at the market, the market is on to the fact that once we get manufacturing, clean rooms, biopharma, all the areas you guys have been focusing on, but these I think, are getting hot, pardon my pun. So what's the environment looking like for these bolt-on? What's your ability to sort of pursue targets at recent valuations? What does the pipeline look right now? What are you interested in? Christopher Kuehn : Andrew, I'll start. It's Chris. Yes, pipeline remains very active. It's Sometimes episodic when an M&A transaction closes. So quarter-by-quarter, maybe hard to call. But over the course of the year, I think the pipeline remains very active. We're very happy with the acquisitions we've done over, say, the last 18, 24 months, right? You properly described them as a bolt-on bit of strategy. Think of that around investments in the channel and investments in technology. And in some cases, it's both. It's taking a great technology that has a limited channel and applying it to our deep channels in Europe and/or in the Americas. We've been very successful with that strategy. As it looks at the pipeline today, we're going to remain disciplined. We've got our hurdle rates. And as we think about what's constructive to be EPS accretive in 3 years, ROIC accretive in 3 years. But I'll tell you that we've got a great balance sheet to really deploy to not only acquisitions but also deploy if the cash isn't available for M&A over to share repurchases as we see the stock trading below our calculated intrinsic value. So if you go back even 6, 7 years ago with an acquisition in Europe with Thermocold, then it really started out with our more pipe chillers and thermal management systems and how that's grown over time now, I think to our sixth or seventh generation of thermal management systems, it tells you that we can take that early-stage technology and really grow it over a longer period of time. We've got the people, we have a great sales team. We have a great service team. That's where some of those investments are going as well this year is to make sure we have all the infrastructure and support to keep growing those businesses.  And I'll tell you, we've got a great team in each of our regions that can integrate acquisitions. When you think about the challenge of an acquisition, a lot of time, it's the success is depending on how well you integrate. We don't think of it as Trane Technologies is acquiring and let's take our best of Trane to the business. It really is also what are we learning from the business we just acquired and bring it into our organization. And I'll tell you some of our recent acquisitions, it's spot on with taking the learnings of the businesses we've acquired, bring them into the Trane family and how do we replicate that across 40, 50 plants across the globe. So I'll tell you where we're bullish in this area. So I'd just say the pipeline remains strong. Operator : Your final question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Noah Kaye : Dave, this is going to be a broad question, but it goes to what you discussed around the increase in complexity in applied. When we think about the customer value proposition, and I understand there are many dimensions, it's going to differ across verticals. How does the increasing complexity play into the customer value proposition? Maybe give us the 2 or 3 biggest dimensions that, that really speaks to and where that creates a sustainable competitive differentiation for the company. David Regnery : Yes, great question, Noah. I think it all starts with our direct sales force that's highly technical, right, they understand the applications and a lot of times, helping the customer think through what the best solution is for whatever their need may be. I always tell people we don't sell products, we sell solutions. And that's the way our account managers behave with customers. We don't -- and as the sophistication of these products continue to increase, obviously, our strength shines, not really on a global basis. A lot of the decision-makers on -- especially some of these mega projects right now are on a global basis. And because we have this direct sales force globally, we're able to really triage the decision-makers and help them think through the technical side. And then, of course, the downstream effect is -- these products are more sophisticated, they require OEM service in the future. So there's a long tail associated with these applied systems that we're selling. And we're investing heavily, too. It's not like people sometimes think about, as I say, we're investing in capacity. They think of it as just the plant, okay, that's part of our capacity investment, but we're also investing heavily in training of our direct sales force, adding to our direct sales force, adding to our service technicians, adding to our engineer skill set, adding to our critical to close process, adding to our back offices to make sure we have the right customer support. So it's all inclusive but it really -- the sophistication of these systems as they become more and more engineered, really just plays into the strength we have as Trane Technologies. Noah Kaye : And the follow-up is really around the attach rate of services to those projects, right. I think you've answered it in part, but just quantitatively how do we think about services attach rates for applied at this point? And where those grow to as you see the increasing complexity of the projects you're working on? David Regnery : As I said in my opening remarks, we think about an applied system, you can think about an 8 to 10x multiplier of services over the life of that system. And we want to be connected to the system, okay? So the -- it's no longer just a break/fix. This is all connected solutions. And by the way, the customer wants us connected to the solution. They want to make sure that it's -- their asset is always performing the way it was designed. I was telling a group earlier this week that it's no longer the system isn't operating properly. The system is using too much energy, but we were able to detect that. And that's where the sophistication goes both ways. It's on the application of the system, but then how you monitor and service that system is also increasing in complexity, and we're right in the leading edge there. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. We'll be around, as always, for any questions that you may have in the coming days and weeks, and we look forward to seeing many of you on the road or actually at our headquarters in some cases, in the near future here. So thanks again, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac Nagle : Thanks, Operator. Good morning. And thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies\u2019 second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com, where you\u2019ll find the accompanying presentation. We\u2019re also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today\u2019s call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today\u2019s call are David Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Zach, and everyone for joining today\u2019s call. As we begin, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which enables our differentiated financial results over time. Our purpose is centered on creating a more sustainable world and our strategy is aligned to powerful megatrends like energy efficiency, decarbonization and digital transformation. We\u2019re all seeing the dire effects of climate change, and governments, NGOs and companies around the world are increasingly taking action. We\u2019re hearing a lot about the need to invest in renewables and green the grid. What we\u2019re not talking enough about is demand-side management. That\u2019s where Trane Technologies comes in. Most buildings operate up to 30% inefficiently. Through our leading-edge technical solutions and sophisticated controls in AI, we can help our customers significantly reduce energy demand and emissions. Our relentless innovation, proven business operating system and uplifting culture enable us to consistently deliver a leading growth profile, strong margins and powerful free cash flow. The end result is strong value creation across the Board for our customers, our shareholders, our employees and for the planet. Please turn to Slide #4. In the second quarter, we extended our track record of strong execution. Our global team delivered robust performance across the Board, not only bolstering our outlook for 2024, but strengthening our visibility to another year of leading performance in 2025. Bookings continue to be exceptional, with healthy momentum into the back half of 2024, as our pipeline of projects continues to grow. Q2 bookings of $5.3 billion rose to an all-time high, up 5% from our prior high in the first quarter and up 19% versus the prior year. Organic revenues were up 13%, with strong execution through the P&L, delivering 23% adjusted EPS growth. Notably, we continued to reinvest heavily in our business and accelerated key strategic investments, further strengthening our competitive positioning for continued market outgrowth. Booking strength continued to be led by our commercial HVAC businesses, where we\u2019re seeing broad-based growth. In top growth verticals, such as data centers, market projections call for an exceptionally strong multiyear CapEx cycle and high levels of project complexity play to our unique strengths. The power of our elite direct sales force, deep customer relationships and leading innovation will enable us to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities ahead. As the leading applied solution provider, we are driving significant market outgrowth in the most attractive high-growth verticals in commercial HVAC. As an example, Q2 revenues of our Americas applied solution are up approximately 90% on the three-year stack. We estimate that our applied systems carry an 8 times to 10 times multiple of higher margin service revenue over the life of the equipment. So, we\u2019re also excited about the service opportunities that lie ahead. Our robust bookings momentum and exceptional backlog of $7.5 billion provides strong visibility into the remainder of 2024 and increasing visibility into 2025. Our backlog includes $2.8 billion for 2025 and beyond, which is the level of backlog we would historically see entering a new year and we\u2019re only halfway through 2024. All in, we\u2019re confident in raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance, which would deliver our fourth consecutive year of 20% or greater adjusted EPS growth. Chris will cover guidance in more detail in a few minutes. Please go to Slide #5. In our Americas segment, our commercial HVAC business delivered industry-leading performance. Bookings were up more than 20% in the quarter. Revenue was up mid-20s and broad base across vertical markets, with equipment up more than 30% and services up high-teens. In residential, the team delivered very strong results, with bookings up more than 30% and revenues up low-teens. Turning to transport, the business performed as expected. Revenues were down high-teens against a tough comp of more than 30% growth in the prior year. The two-year stack growth was more than 10% and well ahead of the market, which was down mid-teens. Bookings were solid, up low-single digits. In EMEA, commercial HVAC strength continues, with bookings up 20%. Revenues were also strong, up high-single digits in the quarter and up over 25% on a two-year stack. Our transport business performed in line with our expectations, with bookings and revenue both down modestly. Turning to Asia, results were in line with our expectations for the second quarter. Asia-Pacific bookings were flat, while China bookings were up mid-single digits. Revenues were down low single digits on a tough prior year comp of 40% growth. We\u2019re pleased with our performance through the first half and expect Asia-Pacific to have another solid year overall. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #6. This slide provides a snapshot of our performance in the second quarter and highlights continued strong execution, top to bottom. Organic revenues were up 13%, adjusted EBITDA and operating margins were both up 140 basis points, and adjusted EPS was up 23%. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up low-teens and mid-teens, respectively. Our high-performance flywheel continues to pay dividends, with relentless investments and innovation driving strong topline growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. Please turn to Slide #7. At the enterprise level, we delivered robust volume growth with strong incrementals, positive price realization and productivity that more than offset inflation and continued high levels of business reinvestment. In our Americas segment, we delivered about 14 points of volume and about 2 points of price. Our Americas commercial HVAC business again outperformed the markets and delivered very strong volume growth of more than 20 points. Adjusted operating margin expansion of 130 basis points was driven by volume growth, productivity and price realization, more than offsetting inflation and high levels of business reinvestment. In our EMEA segment, we delivered about 4 points of volume and 1 point of price, with strong volume in our commercial HVAC business. Adjusted operating margin expansion of 130 basis points was driven by volume growth, productivity and price realization, more than offsetting inflation and high levels of business reinvestment. In our Asia-Pacific segment, the team delivered 310 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, despite a mid-single-digit volume decline. Strong productivity and positive price realization more than offset inflation and high levels of business reinvestment. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide #8. Our end market segment and business unit outlook is largely unchanged, with some notable exceptions in the Americas segment. First, our Americas commercial HVAC business delivered another very strong quarter of market outgrowth. While we\u2019ve highlighted particular strength and key verticals, growth was again broad-based. Revenue growth on a three-year stack was extremely strong, up approximately 45% to 50% in both Q1 and Q2. With our continued positive outlook and exceptional backlog position, we expect three-year stack revenue growth to remain at this high range in the second half of the year. Second, our Americas residential business delivered stronger-than-expected growth in the second quarter, in part driven by three factors. The EPA clarification on the refrigerant transition, the normalization of channel inventories and a strong start to the cooling season. We now expect full-year revenue growth to be up mid-single digits. Third, in our Americas transport business, ACT has lowered their outlook for the 2024 transport markets to down mid-teens. Their expectation is for a much softer second half, which they project to be down more than 25%. We expect to outperform the transport markets in 2024. Looking to 2025, ACT projects approximately 15% growth as freight rates improve. Overall, the changes to our outlook in the Americas segment represent a significant net positive to our enterprise outlook for 2024 and gives us confidence in raising our full year guidance. All other businesses performed largely as expected in the first half and the outlooks for the year are unchanged. We provided additional details on the slide for your reference. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #9. Our initial 2024 guidance reflected targets that we believed would deliver top quartile performance on organic revenue and adjusted EPS growth for the full year. Halfway through, we\u2019re exceeding those objectives. Given our strong performance, positive outlook and exceptional backlog, we\u2019re raising our organic revenue guidance to approximately 10%, 1.5 percentage points above the midpoint of our prior range of 8% to 9%. We\u2019re also raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.35 at the midpoint to approximately $10.80, up from a range of $10.40 to $10.50 prior. With this updated guidance, we\u2019re poised to deliver our fourth consecutive year of 20% or greater adjusted earnings per share growth. We continue to expect about one point of growth from M&A in 2024, with a negative impact of approximately $30 million to adjusted operating income for the full year, for a negative impact of about 5 points to reported leverage versus organic leverage. We also expect about 1 point of negative FX impact in 2024, effectively offsetting the point of growth from M&A. Net, organic, and reported revenue growth guidance for 2024 are the same, at approximately 10%. There\u2019s no change to our organic leverage target of 25% plus for the year, consistent with our stated long-term target and we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings of 100% or greater. For the third quarter, we expect revenue growth of approximately 8.5% and adjusted EPS of approximately $3.15 to $3.20. Please see Page 17 for additional information that may be helpful for modeling purposes. Please go to Slide #10. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we\u2019re committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. Third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide 11 and I\u2019ll provide an update on our 2024 capital deployment. Year-to-date through July, we\u2019ve deployed $1.1 billion in cash, with $379 million to dividends, approximately $100 million to M&A and $650 million to share repurchases. We have $1.8 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, providing us with strong optionality as our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. We continue to have an active M&A pipeline, with potential value accretive opportunities to further improve long-term shareholder returns. For 2024, we expect to deploy approximately $2.5 billion in cash. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet give us excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? David Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please go to Slide #13. We discussed the transport markets in our outlook discussion on Slide #8, so I won\u2019t cover them again here. However, we\u2019ve continued to provide this slide for your reference. Please turn to Slide #14. We operate our transport business for the long-term and while we\u2019re moving through a down cycle in 2024, this is a great business with a bright future. ACT projects a trailer market rebound in 2025, up mid-teens and forecasts continued growth through their 2029 forecast horizon. We have a diversified transport business globally, with opportunities to grow across the portfolio. With leading innovation, strong execution through our business operating system, and a world-class dealer network, we\u2019re well-positioned to outperform in any market environment. Please go to Slide #15. In summary, we are well-positioned to drive differentiated growth over time. Our leading innovation, proven business operating system and unmatched culture enable us to consistently deliver top quartile financial performance over the long-term, while continuing to reinvest in our business and we believe our best days are ahead. We have the team, the strategy and the track record to deliver leading performance and differentiated shareholder returns in 2024 and beyond. And now, we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to start with the organic sales growth guidance. Understand sort of some of the year-on-year dynamics. It can depend, if we\u2019re looking at one-year, two-year, three-year stacks and so forth. So maybe it\u2019s easier to look sequentially. And I think the guidance implies sort of flat sales in Q3 sequentially, normally, they\u2019re up the last few years, sort of mid-single digits, and then the fourth quarter, I think, is implied down double digits sequentially, and recently, it\u2019s been down high singles. So, just wondered sort of from a sequential standpoint, anything in particular you\u2019re seeing or it\u2019s more of just a sort of conservative kind of construct based off the multi-year stacks? Chris Kuehn : Hey. Good morning, Julian. This is Chris. I\u2019ll start. Yeah. Look, we\u2019re happy with the guidance we just put forth and raised full year organic revenue growth target to 10%, up 1.5 points from our prior guide. Think about the second half of the year as I\u2019ll start with commercial HVAC Americas. They\u2019re going to have a great year on a full year basis. As I\u2019ve talked about in prior calls, the comps versus 2023 are just tougher as you go into the second half of the year. As a reminder, a year ago, that business grew mid-teens in Q1, high-teens Q2, and the second half of 2023, it grew in the low-20s to mid-20s Q3 and Q4, respectively. So it\u2019s going to have a great year. Think of that second half range. It\u2019s probably in the 10% to 12% range in growth. And what\u2019s interesting, and we did the math on this, when you think about the first half of 2024 in that business, the three-year revenue stack is a 45% to 50% growth, and it\u2019s actually the same when you look at the second half of the year in 2024 as well. It\u2019s a 45% to 50% revenue growth over the last three years. So, it looks really consistent when you think about it over the last several years with a lot of dynamic markets, so to speak, and dealing with supply chain. But they\u2019re going to have a great year. Think of transport second half of the year, as Dave called out in his comments. I mean, those markets are expected to be down further than what we even thought three months ago. ACT has called those markets down in the mid-20s in the second half of the year. So we expect that business to be down, but we expect to outperform on the full year. And then residential, I\u2019ll leave it within the Americas, mid-single-digit growth plan for the second half of the year. And could it be better? Yeah, maybe it could be better. It is a bit of a step down from the second quarter, but we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about that space. We\u2019re very much in the middle of the cooling season right now. We want to really see where it plays out. But maybe I\u2019ll end there, that we\u2019re confident in the full year guide and could things get a little bit better in the second half? Maybe. But we\u2019ll update you as we get to the call next quarter. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much, Chris. And just my second question on the operating margin outlook. So you\u2019ve got the higher investments that are sort of pushing the full year up leverage into that mid-20s plus framework after a 30s number in the first half. Anything else we should be aware of for the second half in terms of that margin element? Maybe flesh out anything around mix, perhaps? I suppose if resi and transport are a bit softer, there\u2019s a mix negative. Anything else to highlight in terms of, say, price, cost, tailwinds, and also within commercial HVAC mix, anything moving around on applied versus the light side in the back half? Chris Kuehn : Yeah. Good question. I think it\u2019s really less about mix of the businesses. When you think about performance last year and EBITDA margins across EMEA, Asia and the Americas, very different mix of businesses. EBITDA margins were fairly consistent across all three of the businesses, actually Asia leading. But if I think about the second half, this is really where Dave has continued to challenge all of our business units with advancing investments, right? We see it as, and I\u2019ve seen it for a very long time, with accelerating investments, and as we see high returns on them, that\u2019s where I would call it maybe second half of the year. There\u2019s a bit of compounding effect of the investments that we began to ramp in the first quarter of this year. Those wind up being a little bit more costly in the second half, but all of them have really strong returns. So we like the full year guidance and confidence in 25% or better organic leverage. Let\u2019s see where the year plays out. But the focus here is making sure we continuously and relentlessly invest in the business to keep driving this market outgrowth in the next several years and Dave\u2019s keeping the pressure on. David Regnery : I\u2019m sitting here smiling at Chris as he\u2019s saying that, Julian. So thanks for the questions, but we love investing in our business and we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate the results of the investments we\u2019ve been able to make and expect more of that in the future. Julian Mitchell : That\u2019s great. Thank you. David Regnery : Thanks, Julian. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey. Good morning, guys. Dave and Chris, is that? David Regnery : Hey, Scott. How are you doing? Scott Davis : I\u2019m good. Thank you. And today\u2019s results have been good. So it\u2019s been a good day. So I wanted to just dig in a little bit of backlog. It\u2019s kind of your comments about 2 times normal. I\u2019m trying to just tease out what\u2019s changed here. Obviously, demand is solid. But are these backlogs 2 times normal largely because lead times have gone up substantially because these projects have gotten bigger and more complex and folks want to get in front of the line? I\u2019m thinking data centers and semi-fabs and things like that. But perhaps I\u2019m overstating that a bit? David Regnery : Yeah. It\u2019s a great question, Scott. I would say that we should maybe challenge ourselves as to what\u2019s normal, okay. We\u2019re a lot bigger business than we were four years ago, obviously. Lead times, that\u2019s not -- I would say that\u2019s -- I would say lead times are back to what I would call a normal rate. For data centers, for sure. We have data center customers that are providing us visibility to their needs well in advance than, say, maybe some of the other verticals. So that\u2019s a part of it. But look, we\u2019re seeing tremendous strength, really, in almost all verticals. As we looked in the Americas in our commercial HVAC business in the quarter, I think we spoke before, we tracked 14 different verticals. It was hard for us to find a vertical that was down. So we just have broad-based strength. We certainly are seeing a lot of demand in the high growth verticals like data centers, but we\u2019re also seeing nice demand in other verticals as well. Scott Davis : Okay. Helpful. And then China, the bookings are up and I know it can be a little bit lumpy, for sure. But is there an indication that China is bottomed? I think kind of -- I guess my question is kind of A, on the macro side, but B, you guys are probably getting some outgrowth, I would imagine there. So if you have some color around that, B. David Regnery : Yeah. I\u2019d say it\u2019s a good question, Scott. I mean, Asia is less than 10% of the revenue for the enterprise. Okay. Think of it 50% China, 50% the rest of Asia. In the quarter, the region performed as we expected. Revenues were flat. I would tell you that we did see some choppiness in China towards the back half of the quarter. So we have our eyes wide open on that. But I would also tell you that we have that baked into our guide for the year. So I wouldn\u2019t say that China has bottomed. We performed well there. Our team is executing at a very high level. We were a very seasoned team there. A lot of innovations in their pipeline there that they\u2019re rolling out into the marketplace. But just to be clear, getting orders in China are pretty dynamic right now. Scott Davis : Okay. Congrats, Dave. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. David Regnery : Thanks. Appreciate it, Scott. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. David Regnery : Thanks, Andy. Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Andy. David Regnery : Appreciate it. Andy Kaplowitz : Dave, just a little bit more about bookings and backlog momentum going forward. We know you\u2019ve more difficult order comparisons coming up, but could you maintain book-to-bill ladder over 1 times? And then the renewed momentum in Americas commercial HVAC, I know you just said it was relatively broad-based, including data centers, but how long do you think this elevated bookings environment could last and at what point do strong orders give you confidence that 2025 should be another strong earnings growth year or even a double-digit growth year? David Regnery : Yeah. I\u2019m not going to forecast our incoming order rates for the rest of the year. I will tell you that we\u2019re going to have a backlog that\u2019ll be very strong going into 2025, much like you saw us at the beginning of 2024. We already have 2.8 billion booked for 2025 and I mean, that\u2019s a number that we haven\u2019t talked about that size of a number in the past. So we\u2019re very confident there. As far as the demand that we\u2019re seeing, look, we\u2019re seeing a lot of demand and I emphasize it\u2019s broad-based, right? It\u2019s not just in the high growth verticals because we\u2019re very strong there, but it\u2019s broad-based and it really has to do with a lot of our innovation and our ability to execute. And with our direct sales force, we go to where the opportunities are. Our teams are highly technical and we\u2019re winning in the marketplace. It\u2019s that simple. And I couldn\u2019t be prouder of what that team\u2019s been able to execute. And by the way, we\u2019re talking a lot about the Americas, but I would tell you that our commercial HVAC business in Europe also performed extremely well. Their order rates were up 20%. So you could see that investing in the business, always having that long-term vision as to where you want to go and the payback that you get for that, this is a flywheel, as Chris would say, and we\u2019re seeing the impacts of that and that flywheel is going to continue to spin for us. Andy Kaplowitz : Thanks for that. Yeah. I tried there to get to the forecast bookings. Oh, well. So let me then ask you a follow-up. Chris, you kind of alluded to resi and the strength that you\u2019re seeing. It looks like revenues in the first half were already up mid-single digits plus. Orders accelerate obviously in Q2 up 30%. I know you said you want to be conservative, but really is mid-single-digit growth the minimum for the year and what did you -- what have you seen so far during the cooling season? Chris Kuehn : Andy, good question. Yeah. I think mid-singles is probably the floor for the business. Could it be better? Yeah, we think it could be better. But as you know, bookings in that business, it\u2019s less important. It\u2019s really around seeing through the entire cooling season. As you know, there\u2019s a refrigerant transition that\u2019s happening later into this year, into next year, and we\u2019re ready for that. We can certainly answer any questions there as well. But we\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in that team. It\u2019s been a challenging market leading into this cooling season for about a year, year and a half. But yeah, we feel like could that be better? It could be better. But let\u2019s see how the year kind of plays itself out. David Regnery : Yeah. Andy, as I said in our prepared remarks, look, three reasons why we did so much better in resi in the second quarter. One is the clarification on the refrigerant transition. The second is certainly the inventory is at what we would call a normal level in the channel list through our independent wholesale distributors. And the third is not that I like to talk about the weather, but it\u2019s been a very, very warm start to the cooling season, which should have us all concerned for a different reason that we could talk about if you\u2019d like. But it\u2019s been a very, very strong start. So as Chris said, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic in this business, the team performed very well in the second quarter and it\u2019s a great start for that team. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate it, guys. David Regnery : Okay. Thank you. Chris Kuehn : Thank you, Andy. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. Your line is open. Gautam Khanna : Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about your expectations of any pre-buy given the A2L transition and just, yeah, have you already introduced the product, et cetera? David Regnery : Yeah. Gautam, good question. We\u2019ve introduced -- in our commercial business we\u2019ve introduced about half of the products that would be affected. And think about any product that uses a scroll compressor as a target for a refrigerant change, okay. So just in a broad brush. So in our commercial sites, about half of it we\u2019ve introduced. We\u2019re actually selling both. So we\u2019re selling 454B, the new refrigerant, as well as still 410. In our resi business, not yet. We haven\u2019t introduced it. That\u2019ll be rolling out in the back half of the year. As far as pre-buys go, look, we\u2019re not anticipating in our residential business a large pre-buy towards the end of the year. We\u2019ll see how that rolls out. But right now, we\u2019re not forecasting that. There\u2019s just too much timing that you have to work on to make sure that you could sell through all your products in the year and our focus really is on helping our independent wholesale distributors transition their inventory properly. So we\u2019ll be working with them as the year progresses here to make sure that they\u2019re ready for the cooling season in 2025 and then that\u2019s really where our focus is right now. So answer to your question, not a large pre-buy. At least we don\u2019t have one baked in. But I would tell you that the way we designed our operations, we\u2019re able to manufacture both products. So we have mixed model lines, which it was a little bit more upfront cost, but we believe that investment will pay, because as you know, in the resi area, you\u2019ll be providing components of 410 for some time into the future to make sure that we could service our product over the useful life of that product. Gautam Khanna : Great. Thank you. David Regnery : Thanks, Gotham. Appreciate it. Chris Kuehn : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Damian Karas with UBS. Your line is open. Damian Karas : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on the quarter. David Regnery : Good morning, Damian. How are you? Damian Karas : Doing well, thank you. I was wondering if you could maybe help us unpack the 13% organic growth a little bit. Just give us a sense for how much of this topline being driven by volumes versus some price and mixed benefits and just maybe kind of walk us through how you\u2019re thinking about that for the full year now? Chris Kuehn : Hey, Damian. It\u2019s Chris. I\u2019ll start. Yeah. For the quarter, think of it as a little bit over 2 points of price. You\u2019ll see this in the 10-Q that gets filed later today, about 11 points of volume. So as we anticipated coming into the year, we knew that price was going to be a contributor, but less of a contributor than what we saw in 2022 and 2023. That\u2019s been dovetailing. And the offset to that, and a nice offset to that, has been improved productivity. And so as kind of came out at the end of last year, middle last year with supply chain challenges largely resolved, we\u2019re continuing to see improvements on the productivity side. So if I step back, we\u2019re getting the right combination of price, dollars and margin above inflation. It is inflationary out there, to be fair. If I think about tier one costs with copper up, aluminum up to somewhat flat, steel down, refrigerants up, and ultimately, wage inflation really being up, all of that is still going to be a bit inflationary on us for this year. But I like where we are, price versus inflation, the productivity is getting stronger and making sure that we\u2019re funding the business with investments. It was another quarter of a high investment and continued high investment quarter with projects we think that are very, very strong. That volume growth, the 13 points, sorry, 11 points of volume on the 13 points of revenue growth, think of that as 20 points of volume in commercial HVAC Americas. On price that where we were in the second quarter, we\u2019re confident that gives us a lot of view into the full year. Price should be around 2 points as well. And that\u2019ll look a little bit lower in the second half of the year versus the first half, ultimately landing around 2 points on the full year. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. David Regnery : A lot of volume, Damian. Damian Karas : Yeah. Not a bad thing. That was helpful. Thanks. And then I wanted to see if you might be able to share some color on how things are progressing with some of your kind of early stage, emerging growth opportunities, if you will, investment immersion cooling, your AI partnership. Would you envision these being potential capital deployment opportunities down the road? Chris Kuehn : I\u2019ll answer the first question. Emerging cooling, as I\u2019ve said in the past, that\u2019s sort of -- that\u2019s got some hurdles it still needs to work through and we\u2019re working through some of that with our partner there. So that\u2019s not what I would call mainstream. As far as the AI tools, like the Nuvolo acquisition we did, it\u2019s early days, but we really like what we see there and this is going to really help us excel our connected asset solutions. And in my opening remarks, I talked about demand side management and we\u2019re not talking a lot about that. But a lot of people are talking right now about the generation side of power. A lot of people are talking about all the demand that\u2019s coming. What people don\u2019t realize is that, in a building, 30% of the energy that\u2019s consumed is wasted, right? So if you\u2019re connected to the asset, if you\u2019re connected to the building, you\u2019re able to ensure that that asset or that building is going to perform the way it was designed. And this 30% number, right, I\u2019d love to show you some of our stats, but this is a massive amount of energy that can be saved. So we\u2019re really happy. We\u2019re really bullish on Nuvolo. We\u2019re really bullish on what we\u2019re doing with our connected solutions. And I think you\u2019re going hear a lot more about demand side management in the coming years, because it\u2019s not just about generation, it\u2019s not just about forecasting all the demand that\u2019s going to be coming and you see a lot about data centers right now. It\u2019s like, how do we use what we\u2019re generating today in a more efficient way and that\u2019s what we know at Trane Technology we could help our customers with. Damian Karas : Great. Thanks, guys. Best of luck. David Regnery : Thank you, Damian. Thank you. Chris Kuehn : Thanks. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. David Regnery : Hey, Joe. Joe Ritchie : Hey, guys. Good morning. David Regnery : Good morning. Joe Ritchie : So I\u2019m going to touch on data centers again just quickly. I know that it\u2019s both broad-based growth across commercial HVAC in the Americas. I\u2019m just curious, though, are you seeing any constraints on your bookings for data centers, I know that that\u2019s been a hot topic of late. And then also, can you just maybe tell us a little bit about the margin profile of the business that you\u2019re booking in that vertical? David Regnery : I\u2019ll start. I\u2019ll let Chris talk about margins. But constraints from a capacity standpoint, no. I mean, we\u2019ve made capacity expansions over the last several years. So we feel as though we\u2019re in good shape there. It\u2019s more about working with the customers. It\u2019s more about working with the system level within the data center. We\u2019re not just a component supplier within a data center. We look at the entire cooling system, whether you\u2019re cooling at the building level, the server or the servers themselves. This is something that we\u2019re really good at and we\u2019re very strong in this vertical. And we\u2019ve been very strong in this vertical for a long time. I\u2019ll steal a bit of Chris\u2019s thunder here, but the margins in this space are very attractive and we really like our service tail that this provides. Chris, you want to add anything? Chris Kuehn : That\u2019s where I was going to go, Dave. I think, again, these are generally highly customized applied systems when you\u2019re talking about data centers for the most part. And so while we\u2019re pricing for innovation, we\u2019re also making sure we\u2019ve got customers for life. These are customers that are putting in multiple locations, multiple data centers, and we want to make sure we have not only a solution for today\u2019s order, but what that order can be a year, two years, five years from now. As all market projections would suggest that this is going to be a multiyear growth factor with the growth of data centers. And with that, to Dave\u2019s ending point, the opportunity still in front of us is to think about services here, and with typical applied systems generating 8 times to 10 times of the revenue and services from a dollar of equipment, that\u2019s still an opportunity well in front of us as we deploy products into this space and you\u2019re starting to see that a bit in the revenues, but more of that in 2025 and 2026, that\u2019s a nice opportunity still in front of us. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That\u2019s helpful, guys. And then just my quick follow-up, resi HVAC growth this quarter was much better than what some of your other public peers have reported so far. So it looks like you took some share. I was just wondering, was there any disruption that you noticed with any of your public or non-public comps in the quarter? And I know, Dave, you referenced some of the reasons why you grew this quarter, but the growth was surprisingly good? David Regnery : Yeah. I mean, the team executed very well. Look, I\u2019ve been saying for a long time, Joe, you got to look at the share in residential over a longer period than just a quarter. So did you do better in a quarter? Tell me what you\u2019ve done over the long-term. So I can\u2019t comment on if there was any one of our other competitors that didn\u2019t do well, I don\u2019t know that. But I am very pleased with our results. But look, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic here. Look at share over the long-term. Don\u2019t just look at it on a quarter. There\u2019s different sell-in models and you could get the wrong answer if you just look at a particular quarter. But I am very happy with the results that we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate. Joe Ritchie : Okay, guys. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Steve Tusa : Hey. Good morning. David Regnery : Hey, Steve. How are you? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Steve Tusa : Are you guys getting bored yet of putting up these kind of results? David Regnery : Steve, I never get bored of putting up great results. It\u2019s the flywheel that this talks about, right? Steve Tusa : Yeah. Congrats on great execution and very strong results. Could we just get a breakdown of the difference between applied and unitary equipment in the quarter and then what you\u2019re expecting for the second half in those two? Chris Kuehn : Yeah. Steve, I\u2019ll start. I\u2019m happy with performance in both of those businesses with applied and unitary. I\u2019d say both up strong. We talked about commercial HVAC revenues up over 20% in the quarter and both contributing to that. Equipment was up 30%, maybe unitary a bit stronger than applied, but not by much. Second half of the year, think of our -- I\u2019ll start with commercial HVAC Americas, think of that all in about up 10% to 12% in the second half. I described earlier great performance last year in terms of tougher comps with the growth in revenue from call it mid-teens in the first quarter of last year to mid-20s by the fourth quarter of last year. That team\u2019s going to have a great year this year. We\u2019re even more excited about 90% of the backlog is commercial HVAC, the $2.8 billion that Dave spoke about that we already have for 2025 and beyond. That\u2019s all equipment, we don\u2019t have service in that backlog and that\u2019s all commercial HVAC. So, it\u2019s going to be a really strong follow-on to this year and it\u2019s giving us a lot of confidence for growth going into next year. Hopefully, that kind of answers the question. Steve Tusa : And any -- will these diverge in the second half? I mean, it seems like, obviously, with the data center stuff, the applied business and the backlog-related businesses continue to grow really strongly, but the more short-cycle stuff maybe slows a bit given the tougher comps. Is that how we should think about it? Will they diverge a bit, unitary and applied? Chris Kuehn : I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll diverge a bit. I mean, with unitary maybe being up a second quarter, I think they\u2019re going to be somewhat close to each other here in the second half. Services is going to be strong for the second half as well. We\u2019re tracking, as we saw in the second quarter, in Americas business was up high-teens, enterprise was up mid-teens. That\u2019s going to be a nice contributor to the second half as well, but I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s going to be a big divergence in the second half. David Regnery : Yeah. I would agree. Steve Tusa : And then\u2026 David Regnery : \u2026 because I think that\u2026 Steve Tusa : Go ahead. Sorry. David Regnery : Yeah. Steve, I think that, again, when you talk about broad-based growth, right, different verticals are satisfied with different types of products. And if -- in this broad base that we continue to demonstrate results in, you could see that we\u2019re growing both applied and unitary. Not that we look at the business that way because we\u2019re really selling systems. But so our unitary, as Chris said, we were actually stronger in unitary in the second quarter than we were applied, despite the fact that we have very large backlogs in applied. Steve Tusa : One last question for you on the services growth. I mean, I usually think of services as being pretty solid growth, but more stable. These types of growth rates in services are obviously very strong. Credit to you guys. What is the key driver here? It seems like it\u2019s more than just a run rate of recurring break, repair, stuff like that. Is there anything that\u2019s standing out, because it just seems these types of growth rates, they\u2019re not lumpy, but they\u2019re just seemingly way higher than what you would consider to be a nice, steady services business? David Regnery : Yeah. It\u2019s a great question, Steve, and appreciate you noticing our high growth rates there. Just to remind everyone, we\u2019ve had a compound annual growth rate over the last six years of high-single digits. In the second quarter, we were up mid-teens, right? And I -- I\u2019ll just go back to our operating system, right? It\u2019s a system of things that makes our service business great. For sure, it helps when you keep growing your applied installed base because our service business is really built around our applied installed base. But I would also tell you that the mindset that we have of an asset is not performing when it\u2019s not heating or cooling properly and/or it\u2019s using too much energy is a different way to think about it and there\u2019s a lot of growth potential when you start thinking that way. So think about\u2026 Steve Tusa : Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks a lot. David Regnery : Okay, Steve. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes in the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open. Jeff Sprague : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. David Regnery : Hi, Jeff. Good morning. Jeff Sprague : Hey. I hope everybody\u2019s well. I want to come back to data centers too, maybe a little bit bigger picture, just competitive and customer behavior question. Obviously, you and your peers are talking about very strong growth. It seems like there\u2019s plenty to go around. It also does look like you\u2019re probably outgrowing them, but it\u2019s hard to tell. The nature of my question is, are your customers in general and maybe the hyperscalers in particular standardizing on OEMs? You end up dominating hyperscaler A and carrier as hyperscaler B, or are we looking at mixed fleets based on what people can deliver at a point in time? Just give us a sense kind of in this almost gold rush to stand this stuff up, just how the competitive landscape and customer behavior is unfolding? David Regnery : Yeah. I\u2019d say hyperscales, first of all, they like technology and they like always pushing the envelope and trying to increase the efficiency of the system. So, they\u2019re always working with us and they may be working with our competitors as well as to make sure that we can have a more efficient system tomorrow. And we have a lot of cool things that we\u2019re working on there with them. Some of it includes some things that are maybe a little bit outside of that, which is the heat recovery side of things, which I\u2019ve talked about in the past. Look, at the end of the day, these hyperscale customers, they like resiliency as well. So, they\u2019ll typically pick a prime and then they\u2019ll pick a secondary and that\u2019s just prudent behavior on their behalf and we\u2019ve seen that before, but I would tell you they really, really, really like innovative technologies. Jeff Sprague : And Dave, is there a way to think about just your available serve market here, dollars per megawatt deployed or some other metric as you try to really game plan for the capacity you need and the revenue trajectory you might be looking at? Any way you could help us frame that? David Regnery : We have some internal models that I won\u2019t share with you the results, but look, it\u2019s allowed us to be able to help forecast based on talking to our customers, understanding what their demands are, okay. And then kind of pushing that back into what would it mean for us. I would tell you that think of units getting bigger, think of units getting more complex, and think of added features on units like heat recovery. That\u2019s certainly a trend that we\u2019re seeing and that\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re working with our customers\u2019 kind of pushing into the marketplace. Jeff Sprague : Okay. Great. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. David Regnery : Thanks, Jeff. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Great quarter\u2026 David Regnery : Good morning, Nigel. How are you? Nigel Coe : \u2026 obviously. Yeah. Good. Thanks. Look, everything\u2019s really good. I\u2019m going to focus on a couple areas that aren\u2019t so great right now. So, Dave, in a world of down 15% trailer declines this year in NAFTA, how does TK Americas perform? And maybe just on top of that, to add in how the other verticals are performing, your bus rail, et cetera, and spare parts? David Regnery : Yeah. It\u2019s a fair question. Look, the Americas transport business is going to be down in 2014. It\u2019s a more cyclical business than our commercial HVAC business. ACT is projecting the back half of the year to be down 25%. To be fair, our internal models say it could be down even a little bit more than that and that\u2019s what we have baked into our full year guide. Look, I had the opportunity early in my career, Nigel, to run this business. And I would tell you that I\u2019ve seen these downturns in the past. And I would tell you that these markets will come back. And right now it\u2019s projected they\u2019ll come back in 2015. We\u2019ll stay tuned on that. But this is a very strong business. And when these markets come back, they\u2019re going to come back strong. And the key is to continue to invest in the business when you\u2019re in this down cycle. And when you do that, when the markets come back, you\u2019re able to delight your customers with a portfolio of innovation that really allows you to win through that cycle and that\u2019s what our plan is right now. As Chris said, we\u2019ve been investing heavily in the business. We\u2019re not stopping that. And TK is a big part of those investments that we\u2019re making. And I\u2019m excited about the innovation pipeline that\u2019s going to come out in the Thermo King business and when the markets come back, we\u2019re going to be ready. As far as the other businesses, I mean, they tend to follow a trailer, I mean, and the trailer is the big one, but they tend to follow that same cycle. We start to get freight rates to improve. If we start to get capacity coming out of the channel, we\u2019ll see the market start to rebound and I know they will. Nigel Coe : Okay. They certainly will. Absolutely. So, would down mid- to high-teens be reasonable for TK Americas in the back half of the year? Chris Kuehn : Nigel, this is Chris. Yeah. I mean, I think they could be down mid-single to high-single in the second half of the year. I mean, we expect it to be down probably in a range of low doubles, double digits on the year. If trailer markets are down mid-teens, we expect to outperform. And again, that\u2019s the innovation and the investments we\u2019ve had in this business for many, many years. And the key here is to make sure that while it is a down year and we\u2019re going to manage the decrementals as so far we have, and we expect to do that for the balance of the year, it\u2019s making sure that we\u2019ve got the investment pipeline that continues to run the business. Just in June, we finished our long range plans for each of our business units, thinking about capacity and not only in commercial HVAC, but all of our businesses. And this is one that we like these markets to Dave\u2019s point, want to make sure we\u2019re still investing so that when the markets do recover, we\u2019re ready. Could the market be down more than mid-teens? I mean, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve called it right now. To be fair, I know ACT\u2019s had multiple revisions here over the last several months. I think it\u2019s four or five this year already. Our internal models would suggest maybe it\u2019s down a little more than that. So we\u2019re making sure we bake that into our guide at this point. Second half of the year, we expect it to be down on down comps from a year prior, but we do expect to outperform the market. Nigel Coe : Okay. Guys, I had a follow-up question, but that was a great answer. So I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks a lots, guys. David Regnery : Okay. Thanks, Nigel. Chris Kuehn : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC. Your line is open. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. David Regnery : Hey, Deane. How are you? Deane Dray : I\u2019m doing real well. Thank you. I just want to circle back on unitary. One of your competitors this quarter talked about making a push into the emergency replacement of unitary into that market where they said they really don\u2019t have any share. How might the competitive dynamics change here and the economic returns? Just any comments from you would be helpful. Thanks. David Regnery : That\u2019s a tough one for me to answer. I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re planning on doing. I would tell you that we\u2019re very strong in unitary as far as the replacement market goes. Yeah, in the heat of the summer, if the unit stops working, it needs to be replaced and having the available unit on hand is very, very important. And we carry a lot of inventory stock and we also have, with our lean thinking in manufacturing, quick ship programs, which allows us to really win in this space. Deane Dray : Is it fair to say that the emergency replacement market is basically half of the business today or is that overstated? David Regnery : Yeah. I can\u2019t comment on that and I think it would be -- it would really -- it would depend on the time of year, okay. You also have a planned replacement market as well. So there\u2019s a lot of things that are part of that statement that you just made. So it really depends. Deane Dray : All right. I understand. That\u2019s helpful. And then second question, any updates on all of the megaprojects? Are you seeing any bidding coming through? Any updates would be helpful. Thanks. David Regnery : Yeah. I mean, we continue to track megaprojects. And as I\u2019ve said in the past, megaprojects tend to be in verticals that we were always strong in. So it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s incremental in that space. But right now, our teams are tracking over 300 projects and some of them have been closed, but many of them are still in the pipeline. And one of the things about these megaprojects is they tend to have lots of different decision makers, especially if any of the semiconductor space that, I mean, I\u2019ll give you an example. We had a project that the decision maker was in Asia, the engineer was in Seattle, Washington, and the mechanical was in Austin, Texas. And one of the advantages that we have with our direct sales force is we could really help the customer triage all the information that\u2019s required. And it allows us to really be focused on the customer needs, but also all the different individuals that are part of that process. So we really like our positioning with these megaprojects. And a lot of these megaprojects are very sophisticated, engineered products, which actually plays to our strength as well. Deane Dray : Great. Thank you. David Regnery : Sure, Deane. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Yeah. Thanks. I\u2019ll just ask one question. And David, goes back to your opening comments around demand-side management as an underappreciated lever here. You\u2019re sitting on one of the largest flexible capacity assets on the grid and you\u2019re expanding your ability to play in distributed resource management and virtual power plants, district heating. I was hoping you could maybe connect the dots for us a bit more and just frame up how meaningful this is becoming in terms of some of the commercial HVAC bookings and revenue trends, how much they expand your wallet share, anything you can do to help quantify for us some of these additional facets of the business? David Regnery : Well, I appreciate the question, Noah. I think we\u2019re still in the early innings on this. I know we\u2019re in the early innings. It\u2019s more about an education process. We were working with a customer, a large customer in New York City and we created a digital twin for their particular building. And we were connected and we were watching the energy consumption. And we saved that particular customer, it may not sound like a lot, but it was like $120,000, right, in energy that they would have wasted if we weren\u2019t connected to their solution. So, and you think about the universe, okay? If you think about the commercial space at 400 billion square feet, I mean, it\u2019s crazy the opportunity that exists. So, look, this is a massive opportunity. Demand-side management, you\u2019re going to hear a lot more about it. And the neat thing about it is you don\u2019t have to wait for new technology to be developed, right? This is technology that\u2019s readily\u2026 Noah Kaye : Right. David Regnery : \u2026 available and being connected from a structured data standpoint, which we\u2019ve been for a while, but now we\u2019re adding in unstructured data with our AI tools. We\u2019re able to really dial in algorithms to really help our customers save energy, which is saving carbon, which is good for the planet as well. Noah Kaye : Okay. Thank you. We\u2019ll look forward to hearing more. David Regnery : All right. Thanks, Noah. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : We\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining on today\u2019s call. As always, we\u2019ll be around for any questions that you may have. So, feel free to bring us up. And then in the coming months, we\u2019ll be on the conference circuit, obviously, and we\u2019ll hope to see some of you on the conference as well. So, thanks for joining, and have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

The call will begin in a few moments with the speaker remarks and the Q&A session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, we will have a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Zac Nagle, Vice President of Investor Relations. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Trane Technologies' third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast on our website at tranetechnologies.com where you'll find the accompanying presentation. We are also recording and archiving this call on our website. Please go to Slide 2. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Zac, and everyone, for joining today's call. Please turn to Slide #3. I'd like to begin with a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which enables our differentiated financial results over time. Climate change is occurring much faster than anticipated, affecting people and communities around the world, as we saw here in North Carolina just a few weeks ago. Urgent and transformative action is needed to reduce emissions and limit global warming. That's where Trane Technologies comes in. Through our innovation, we are helping our customers reduce energy and emissions. When you consider that in a typical building, approximately 30% of the energy after the meter is wasted, it's a massive opportunity. And for our customers, it's grain for grain, good for the planet and good for the bottom line. With our relentless innovation, consistent execution and uplifting culture, we are positioned to deliver a leading growth profile and differentiated financial results over the long term and build a more sustainable future. Please turn to Slide #4. We delivered strong performance in the third quarter, extending our track record of leading revenue and EPS growth among industrials. Our global team delivered 11% organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 120 basis points and adjusted EPS growth of 21%. Enterprise organic bookings were very strong at $5.2 billion, the second quarter highest in the company's history, up 5% in the quarter and up 13% on a two-year stack. To put this into perspective, bookings were only about $120 million or 2% below our highest bookings quarter in Q2 of this year. Organic bookings in Americas commercial HVAC this quarter were also the second highest in company's history, up low-single-digits and up mid-teens on a two-year stack. Q3 bookings were only $100 million below the highest bookings quarter in Q1 of 2024. Net absolute bookings remained very strong. Given the tremendous growth we've seen over the past four years and the variation in order timing, comps will likely continue to be somewhat lumpy. While absolute bookings are expected to remain very strong, backlog also remains very strong at $7.2 billion, up from $6.9 billion at year-end 2023, and we expect to exit 2024 with highly elevated backlog. We encourage investors to look at absolute bookings, revenues and backlog, along with growth rates in order to gain a clear picture of our strength. Robust performance continues to be led by our Americas commercial HVAC business, where revenue growth has been exceptionally strong and consistent. Revenues for each of the first three quarters of 2024 are up 50% plus on a three-year stack, inclusive of both equipment and services. And we expect the fourth quarter revenue to be up 50% on a three-year stack as well. We are building a strong track record of market outperformance, particularly as increasing project complexity plays to our unique strengths in innovation and direct sales and service. Case in point, organic bookings and revenue for our Applied Solutions in the Americas are both up well over 100% over the past four years. Our installed base is expanding rapidly, adding an estimated eight to 10 multiple of higher-margin services revenue over the life of the equipment. Our strong performance throughout 2024 has enabled us to accelerate incremental investments, while delivering full year leverage above our long-term framework of 25% plus. We've stepped up the pace of investments in the second half of 2024, further strengthening our position for 2025 and beyond. Given our strong performance and positive outlook, we are raising our full year organic revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. Chris will cover our guidance update in more detail later in the presentation. Please go to Slide #5. In our Americas segment, commercial HVAC has delivered exceptional bookings and revenues throughout the year, as I've highlighted on the prior slide, with broad-based strength across vertical markets. Revenue was very strong, up nearly 20% in the quarter, with equipment and services up nearly 25% and mid-teens, respectively. In residential, the team delivered very strong results with bookings up high-20%s and revenues up low-teens. Turning to transport, the business performed as expected. Bookings were strong, up high-20%s. Revenues were down high-single-digits, consistent with our guide. In EMEA, commercial HVAC strength continues to be driven by demand for our innovation, with bookings up mid-single-digits in the quarter and up high-teens on a two-year stack. Revenue was also strong, up low-teens. Our transport business performed in line with our expectations, with bookings up mid-teens and revenues flat. Turning to Asia, results were mixed between China and the rest of Asia. Starting with the rest of Asia, bookings and revenues were solid, up low-single-digits and up mid-single-digits, respectively. China had a challenging quarter, which I'll discuss in more detail on Slide 8. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #6. This slide provides a snapshot of our performance in the third quarter and highlights continued strong execution top to bottom. Organic revenues were up 11%, adjusted EBITDA margin was up 120 basis points, and adjusted EPS was up 21%. At an enterprise level, we delivered strong organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up double-digits and low-teens, respectively. Our high-performance flywheel continues to pay dividends with relentless investments in innovation, driving strong top-line growth, margin expansion and EPS growth. Please turn to Slide #7. At the enterprise level, we delivered robust volume growth with strong incrementals, positive price realization and productivity that more than offset inflation, and continued high levels of business reinvestment. In our Americas segment, we delivered about 12 points of volume and 3 points of price. Strong volume growth in our commercial HVAC and residential businesses was partially offset by muted performance in our transport business. Adjusted operating margin expansion of 130 basis points was driven by volume growth, productivity and price realization, more than offsetting inflation and high levels of business reinvestment. In our EMEA segment, we delivered about 7 points of volume and 1 point of price with strong volume in our commercial HVAC business. Adjusted operating margin expansion of 140 basis points was driven by volume growth, productivity and price realization, more than offsetting inflation and high levels of business reinvestment. In our Asia Pacific segment, volumes declined by approximately 22 points. The team was able to deleverage within gross margin rates. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide #8. Our outlook is largely unchanged as we move closer to the end of the year with America's commercial HVAC and residential a bit stronger and Asia Pacific more muted. We've talked about the strength of our Americas commercial HVAC business at length, so I won't go into a lot more detail. We expect the strength to continue in the fourth quarter with three-year stacked revenue growth of approximately 50%, consistent with our performance each quarter this year. Our residential business delivered stronger-than-expected growth in the third quarter, driven by the factors highlighted on the slide. We continue to expect a modest pre-buy of 410A in 2024, primarily impacting Q1 of 2025. We've raised our full year 2024 revenue growth outlook to up high-single-digits, up from mid-single-digits prior. In our Americas transport business, ACT continues to forecast the 2024 transport markets to be down mid-teens, and we expect to outperform. Looking to 2025, ACT has moderated their trailer growth expectations to up low-single-digits. This includes a weak first half and a stronger second half, and we largely agree with that view. We've been investing heavily in our transport business. And as the markets recover, we expect to emerge well-positioned to outperform. Overall, the changes to our outlook in the Americas segment are favorable, and we reflected this in our raised guidance for the year. Turning to EMEA, the business performed as expected, and there's no change to our outlook. Asia represents about 8% of our overall revenue mix with about 50% in China and 50% in the rest of Asia. The rest of Asia performed in line with our expectations in the third quarter, and we expect continued modest growth in Q4 as well. Our China commercial HVAC business came in below our expectations in the third quarter, primarily related to two factors : First, the non-residential markets in China deteriorated meaningfully since the June timeframe, and bookings and revenues were negatively impacted as a result. Second, we made the prudent decision to tighten our credit policies in China, primarily related to downpayments and progress payments. Despite the significant revenue decline in China, the team maintained deleverage within gross margin rates. While China will remain a dynamic environment, we expect some improvements in the fourth quarter as our customers and sales teams navigate the market and policy changes. We have an outstanding team in China that has delivered leading results for many years, and I remain confident in our team's ability to outperform over the long term. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide #9. We continue to target top-quartile performance on organic revenue and adjusted EPS growth for the full year and believe we're on track to achieve those objectives. Given our continued strong performance, positive outlook and exceptional backlog, we're raising our organic revenue guidance to approximately 11% from our prior guide of 10%. We're also raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.30 to approximately $11.10, up from $10.80 prior. We're well positioned to deliver our fourth consecutive year of adjusted earnings per share growth of 20% or greater. Between our strong year-to-date revenue performance and the addition of two small acquisitions that we made in the third quarter, we expect M&A to contribute approximately 50 basis points to 100 basis points to revenue in 2024, which we expect to result in about 3 points of negative impact on reported versus organic leverage for the year. We also expect a more moderate negative impact from FX for the year at less than 1 point, effectively offsetting the positive revenue impact of M&A. Net organic and reported revenue guidance is the same at approximately 11%. We expect full year organic leverage of approximately 30%, up from our prior guidance of 25% more. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings of 100% or greater. Absolute free cash flow is expected to be higher, reflecting our higher adjusted earnings guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue growth of approximately 7% and adjusted EPS of approximately $2.50. Embedded in this guidance is a step-up in investments and higher incentive-based compensation, reflecting strong performance in 2024. Please see Page 18 for additional details related to our guidance that may be helpful for modeling purposes. Please go to Slide #10. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy, focused on consistently deploying excess cash to opportunities with the highest returns for shareholders. First, we continue to strengthen our core business through relentless business reinvestment. Second, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet that provides us with continued optionality as our markets evolve. And third, we expect to consistently deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our balanced approach includes strategic M&A that further improves long-term shareholder returns, and share repurchases as the stock trades below our calculated intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide #11. Year-to-date through October, we've deployed or committed approximately $2 billion in cash, with about $800 million to dividends, $230 million to M&A and about $1 billion to share repurchases. We have $1.5 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, providing us with strong optionality as our shares remain attractive, trading below our calculated intrinsic value. We continue to have an active M&A pipeline, with potential value-accretive opportunities to further improve long-term shareholder returns. Our outlook for 2024 cash deployment remains unchanged at approximately $2.5 billion. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity, balance sheet and significant share repurchase authorization gives us excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please go to Slide #13. We discussed the transport markets in our outlook discussion on Slide #8, so I won't cover them again here. However, we've continued to provide this slide with additional details for your convenience. Please turn to Slide #14. We operate our transport business for the long term. And while we will continue to manage through a down cycle in 2024, this is a great business with a bright future. ACT projects a modest trailer market rebound in 2025, mid-teens growth in 2026 and 2027, and continued strong markets in 2028 and 2029. We're directionally aligned with these projections. We have a diversified transport business globally and opportunities to grow across the portfolio. With leading innovation, strong execution through our business operating system and a world-class dealer network, we're well positioned to outperform in any market environment. Turning to Slide #15. We expect to provide 2025 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call. However, given our strong bookings, backlog and growing pipeline of opportunities, visibility into 2025 has steadily increased. We thought it would be constructive to provide our early views on 2025 as another year of healthy growth. Our commercial HVAC businesses are executing well. Our world-class direct sales and service teams are a clear competitive advantage, enabling us to quickly pivot across vertical markets to capture growth opportunities. We have the broadest and most innovative portfolio in the industry, and we're relentlessly reinvesting in our business for growth. As we look at market opportunities, we're in the early innings of a strong multiyear CapEx cycle. We're also in early innings on the journey to decarbonize hundreds of billions of square feet across the built environment. Increasing complexity of these project opportunities plays to our unique strengths, and we're seeing this in our bookings, backlog and pipeline of projects. Net, we see another strong year ahead for commercial HVAC in the Americas and in EMEA. In Asia and more specifically, China, which is more than 90% commercial HVAC, the macro is more dynamic. However, with China at roughly 4% of our portfolio, we expect strength in the Americas and EMEA to more than offset a challenging backdrop for the region. Turning to residential. We've moved through a period of normalization in 2023 and 2024, and we believe we're returning to a GDP-plus framework. While we expect a moderate amount of prebuy in 2024, we expect this to largely impact revenues in the first quarter of 2025. Pricing differentials from the A2L transition should also act as a tailwind as we move through 2025. Turning to our Americas transport business, which is about 7% of our revenues, ACT is projecting modest growth, largely in the second half of 2025. Net, 2025 will be a modest tailwind for the enterprise. We continue to lead with innovation, which yields healthy pricing opportunities, and our business operating system is prime to stay ahead of inflationary pressures. Underpinning our enterprise growth is our resilient services business. Services comprised about a third of our enterprise revenues and has averaged high single-digit growth over the past seven years. We see opportunities for continued growth in services across our portfolio. In particular, we expect strong performance in our commercial HVAC businesses with our large and growing installed base. With increased focus on decarbonization, we're seeing increased demand for digital performance optimization and demand side management, where our energy services business shines. All in, we're excited about the opportunities for strong growth again in 2025. Please go to Slide #16. In summary, we are well positioned to deliver leading performance and differentiated shareholder returns in 2024 and beyond. We recently received the results of our annual employee engagement survey, and engagement was at a record level, and in the top quartile compared to external companies. I experienced that engagement firsthand when I see our team members engage with customers around the world. That engaging culture, combined with our leading innovation and proven business operating system continues to set us apart. I'm proud of our team's consistent track record and believe our brightest days are ahead. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Scott Davis from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Scott Davis : Hey, good morning, Dave, and Chris and Zac. Dave Regnery : How you doing, Scott? Scott Davis : I'm great. The numbers are good. I'm just trying to figure out a little bit of, perhaps, you can help with some context around data center specifically, just since it's so topical right now. Just anything you can give us, whether it's growth, orders, materiality to your algorithm? I'm just trying to get my arms around how important that is for you guys for the next year. Dave Regnery : Sure. Good question, Scott. Look, Scott, we've been strong in data centers for decades now, okay? So, this has always been a very strong vertical for us. And I think we were kind of early adopters in the data center. We had a dedicated team that just focused on data centers, which has really allowed us to continue to remain very strong in that vertical. If you look at data centers, the growth projection that's projected, I mean, if you take the middle there, and there's a lot of numbers out there, you're going to see the data center vertical is going to be growing at the mid-teens for the foreseeable future. And you should expect that Trane Technologies will continue to be very, very strong in this vertical as we have been for a long time. So, it's important that when you think of data centers, they're probably the most complex systems that we build, okay? We like working directly with the data center customers. We like thinking about it at a system level, okay? You'll hear a lot about different components within the system. We look at the entire system and really help the customers think through optionality that exists for their particular needs based on what they're going to be using in that data center for. And it does depend on what they're going to be using it for. Chris, I don't know if you want to add anything. Chris Kuehn : Yeah. What I would add, Scott, is year-to-date in our Americas commercial HVAC business, data centers have provided a lot of growth to bookings, but when you remove data centers from those bookings, the rest of the verticals, in aggregate, are also up very strong. So, we like the broad-based focus of our direct sales force. Data centers is one strong vertical, but as we highlighted in our release, there's a number of verticals that have been strong for us this year, almost nearly all of them year-to-date showing strength. Scott Davis : Okay. That's helpful. And I wish you'd size it for us, but I understand if you don't want to do that, it's totally fine. Just moving to China, guys. Is that market mature enough at this point where we can start to see it, perhaps moving to more retrofit and services and being a little bit more stable longer term? I understand the down 45%, projects can disappear pretty quickly over there. But it's been a couple of decades now that you guys have been pretty strong and have a pretty big installed base there. So, is that something that you see that kind of becoming a more mature market going forward? Dave Regnery : Yeah. I mean, we have a service business in China, as you're aware, it's not at the same level that you would see here in the Americas, but it's growing. Look, specifically in China, I know I've read a lot of the pre-reports here. Let me just be very specific. Look, our business in China, I think we all understand what's happening in the markets in China, and we were obviously impacted by that. The second is that we thought it was very prudent for us to tighten our credit policies and specifically around downpayments and progress payments. So for example, if a customer wants to give us an order and they don't give us a downpayment with that, we will not accept the order. If we have a product that's complete and ready to ship to the customer, and the customer doesn't provide the proper downpayment -- or progress payments, we will not ship that product to the customer. So look, long term, we know this is the right decision to make. We have a great team in China. It's performed exceptionally well for a long period of time. And I have 100% confidence that we'll continue to outperform the market there. Our teams are just going to be working through this in the fourth quarter and these changes. And look, it's the right decision to make for that particular region at this particular time. Scott Davis : Okay. Makes sense. I'll pass it on. Best of luck, guys. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Scott. See in December. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Snyder from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Chris Snyder : Thank you. I wanted to ask on services, which continues to be really strong, up low-teens again here in Q3. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about the mechanics of the service business? What is the lag between when you sell the equipment to when it starts generating service revenue? Anything you could talk about on service margins? And then, it seems like a lot of the reinvestment the company is making is in that service side. So, just what are you spending on to better position the company to capture more of that revenue? Dave Regnery : Sure. I'll start and I'll let Chris answer some of the margin questions. But look, we love our service business. It's a third of the company. And it's very, very resilient, okay, over the last seven years, it's -- compound annual growth rate is high-single-digits. So, it's a very, very competitive weapon that we have within Trane Technologies. And we continue to, as you've noted, invest heavily in it. Look, as far as the timing as to when a product gets installed, specifically on the applied side to when service starts, it varies, okay, depending on what the warranty is on a particular product. A lot of customers will have extended warranties. That's why I say it varies. And obviously, that would vary around the world. But think of it year two, year three, it starts to ramp up. And by the way, even if it's under extended warranty, we're going to be doing PM work on these products in many cases. The applied systems are so much more sophisticated today than they were just four or five years ago. And the customers are really demanding that the OEMs do the service on these systems to make sure that they're always performing the way they're designed. And Chris, you and I spoke a lot about connected solutions in the past. And I would tell you that, that's going to be so fundamental to how we continue to drive our service business in the future. I think you could certainly understand that our installed base is increasing. That's the -- that will continue to drive growth. But the connected solutions and making sure that the asset is always performing the way it was designed and consuming energy at that level is so important. Today and a little bit certainly into the future, an HVAC asset isn't performing not only if it's not cooling properly, not only if it's not heating properly, not only if it's not ventilating properly, but if it's using too much energy. And if you think about that, that's where the opportunity is. And we have done hundreds of energy audits in buildings, and we know that I'll be conservative here and say that 30% of the energy after the meter is being wasted. However, if you are connected to an asset, you could always ensure that it's performing the way it was designed and that's going to continue to be a significant tailwind for our service business well into the future. So, Chris, I don't know if you want to talk about margins? Chris Kuehn : Yeah. I'd add with the applied growth over the past four years, Chris, over 100%, that obviously bodes well as we think about that installed base maturing. And as Dave said, two to three years out, starts to build a little bit of a ramp on the services revenues. The services business, I'll call it, higher margins in the average. So, we like that business for that reason as well. And it's a perfect example of where we've accelerated investments over the last few years, but even more so into the second half of this year. Dave talked about digital connected solutions. That's absolutely one way we're making investments, but think about it as capacity as well. I'm not going to focus on factories or plant capacity. I'm going to focus on people. And when you think about sales and service, adding employees from covering verticals to adding service technicians to support our customers with that higher installed base. That's one area where we're really continuing to inflect up in investments. And then, the tools to support the sales and service team. So, sales support tools, whether it'd be customer relationship tools, order intake tools, billing, collections, you name it, it's all part of what Dave and I coming out of the second quarter, said we're going to accelerate the speed of some of these investments just give us even further confidence on growth over the next couple of years. But it's such a strong business and we're going to keep investing in it. Dave Regnery : Yeah. One other point, Chris, that I always tell people that some of our service technicians are our best sales associates. As you think about it, our service techs are with our customers every day, and they're building that trusted advisor relationship with our customers. They often see opportunities that the customer can make improvements in their own facilities. So, they do a fantastic job for us, but the service business is a strong part of Trane Technologies today and think of it being even stronger tomorrow. Chris Snyder : Really, really appreciate all of that. Maybe just following up on data center service specifically. If we kind of think about that two- to three-year lag, it would imply that a lot of the growth we've seen in -- certainly in orders, and even, I guess, revenue on the data center side over the last 12, 18 months hasn't really found its way into service yet. Can you just maybe talk about service [Technical Difficulty] different in data center elsewhere? And I just asked because, obviously, these are customers that are very sophisticated, uptime is everything. Energy efficiencies even more important there than it is elsewhere. So, any just color on how the data center service model differs would be helpful. Thank you. Dave Regnery : As I said earlier, think of it as the more sophisticated the product, the greater the appetite is for the OEM to do the service. And data centers tend to be some of the most sophisticated systems that we deploy. So, we're very strong in the data centers there and service. And by the way, I know that the growth over the last several years has been fantastic in data centers. But remember, data centers have been around for a long time, and we've been very strong in this vertical for -- since the beginning. So we have -- even though we've seen tremendous growth, we also have a big installed base in data centers that we're servicing today. Chris Snyder : Thank you. Dave Regnery : Sure, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Julian Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe I just wanted to start with Slide 15. You talk -- gave us some very useful pointers on next year. Just when we're thinking about kind of -- any color you could give us as to how to think about organic operating leverage? This year is guided at 30% now. Trying to think about sort of that for next year. Anything you're calling out in terms of, say, mix? It looks like you get a mixed tailwind, perhaps, within resi from the A2L transition. There may be some high operating leverage as transport markets turn around more in the second half. I guess I want sort of rolling all that together, should we expect kind of strong operating leverage in '25? Any reason not to? Chris Kuehn : Hey, Julian, it's Chris. I'll start. We'll provide a bit more detail around 2025 in our earnings call for the fourth quarter, but we really do like that long-term algorithm of 25% or better operating leverage and making sure we have the ability to fund investments in the business. We would be targeting 2025 for top quartile financial performance. We're going to look at that in the top line. We look at that on the bottom line and cash conversion as well. One thing so far this year, we've had excellent free cash flow conversion. The average over the last four years is, I think, 108%. And so we're going to be targeting top line, bottom line and really strong cash conversion going into 2025. So, we would expect commercial HVAC to be -- remain strong. The backlog visibility gives us a lot of confidence around that. We just talked about services and the high-single-digit growth we've seen over the last seven years gives us a lot of confidence that should continue. And I think about Americas transport, it's probably not a headwind, it could be a modest tailwind going into next year, just given the expectation of around refrigerated trailers in the Americas being up low-single-digits, more second half of the year than first half. So, we think we got some nice tailwinds going into next year, but on the leverage, we like the 25% or greater algorithm and keep those investments coming. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much, Chris. And then maybe my second question just around the US resi HVAC market, which I don't think has been touched on in the questions so far. Maybe just help us understand, I think, Dave, you mentioned a slight increase to your revenue assumption for that business this year. Was that tied to sort of share gain or some behavior by distributors in general? Any color on that? And it sounds like you're pretty confident of decent revenue growth in 2025 again despite the prebuy. I just wondered if you could flesh that out, please, at all. Dave Regnery : Yes, sure. Well, Julian, first of all, nice job on CNBC the other day. I saw you did a fantastic job. So, nice to see. Look, on resi, look, let's just go back. We started the year and we were thinking that resi was going to be plus or minus low-single-digits. And then, at the end of the first quarter, we kind of said, look, the EPA clarification around the refrigerant transition, that was a nice help. We thought that inventory had normalized in the channel, so that was a help. And then, we had a very warm cooling season, right? So I think it was a very hot summer and that certainly drove growth as well. As far as share goes, I'm sure -- yeah, we're saying we've had nice gains, but I've heard everyone say they have nice gains. So, I'm not sure where that will come out, but we're very confident and we're happy with the share that we have in that space and the progress that, that team has been able to make. Look, our team is really executing at a high level in residential right now. We've made some investments there in our manufacturing that are really paying dividends. And I could not be more proud of what that team has been able to execute to. So, we're very happy with what we're seeing in residential. As far as 2025 goes, look, I've been saying for a long time that I believe our resi business is a GDP plus business. And I think that's the framework that we're working through that we'll get back to in 2025. The prebuy, look, I don't think there's going to be a significant prebuy. I've been saying that since January. There will be something. We'll clarify that as we get through the fourth quarter. But look, resi business is operating on all cylinders right now, and we expect it to continue into the future. Julian Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andy Kaplowitz : Hey, good morning, everyone. Dave Regnery : Good morning, Andy. Chris Kuehn : Hey, Andy, how you doing? Andy Kaplowitz : Good. How are you? Dave, look, I know you already talked about data centers a little bit, but interestingly, in your presentation, you mentioned other verticals. You've mentioned before education, healthcare, but you also mentioned office. Maybe you can elaborate on what you're seeing there. And then, given we're at the tail end as you're spending for K-12, what could that mean for education-related HVAC spend in 2025? Dave Regnery : Andy, look, first of all, thanks for noticing office on the page. We haven't talked about office in a long time. And although it may sound counterintuitive because you still have vacancy rates that are quite high, but we had a very strong quarter in office. Actually, year-to-date office is up from an order rate perspective. And if you think about it, you go kind of a click lower, you could sit there and say, well, we're doing a really good job in Class A buildings. And we're also really helping our customers navigate through how they get tenants back into their space. And I know you had the opportunity to visit us in New York, and you got to see it firsthand, right? Having this direct sales force with deep domain expertise as to what's happening in a particular city is critical, right? We know what the carrots are, what the sticks are and, more importantly, how to navigate that so that we could help the customer make the right decisions so they can get tenants back into their space. So, it's just -- I can't speak enough about our direct sales force. I can't speak enough about how they pivot to where the opportunities are and how. It's not just about data centers that's growing. For us, it's really almost all of our verticals. I was doing the study or I had the team do a study, and I was looking from year-to-date from order rates, and I'll speak about commercial HVAC, we track 14 different verticals, 13 of them were positive by a lot, and office was one of those. So, it just shows you the broad-based strength that we have and the ability of our teams to really navigate to where the opportunities are. So, I could not be happier with seeing office on the page, and the team continues to execute at a high level there. Andy Kaplowitz : Great. And let me just ask you about China in the context of -- you obviously had somewhat high decremental margins there. Some of that is the choices you've made. Do you -- again, you've been in China for a long time. You moved to direct sales and everything was good once you did that. Do you see this as a more structural issue, or is it really just cyclical? And if it is either way, can you take more cost out of that business, or how should we think about that to offset higher decrementals? Dave Regnery : Yeah. I mean, well, first of all, the team performed quite well. Even though the revenues were down, they were, within gross margins, on a deleverage standpoint. So, that was good to see. Look, we're going to just work through this in China. We have a great team there, and we have a great business, and we've been overperforming in China for a long time. We've made a decision to change our credit policy, specifically around downpayments and progress payments. Long term, this will be the right decision. And I think people will see that in the future. But right now, our teams are working through this change. I have all the confidence in the world that they'll get back to outperforming here in the future. But right now, we're going to work through it, and -- but a great team there that's executed for a long time at a high level, and I expect more of that in the future. Andy Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color, guys. Dave Regnery : Okay. Thanks, and we'll see you in a couple of weeks. Andy Kaplowitz : Yeah, see you soon. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Joe Ritchie : Hey, guys. Good morning. Dave Regnery : Hey Joe, how are you? Joe Ritchie : Doing great, Dave. Thanks. Yes, look, we talked about office. We talked about data centers. Clearly, the commercial HVAC business is humming along. Can you maybe just kind of talk a little bit about some of the megaproject activity, how that's coming through, whether it's semiconductor plants? I know there's been some delays on EV plants. Just any commentary around that would be helpful. Dave Regnery : Yes. Megaproject is my favorite term, I don't really like it. But look, megaprojects are happening in verticals that we've always been very strong in, and it's dynamic, as you could imagine, right? Yeah, you've talked about a few projects that maybe are getting a little bit delayed, we have others that are pulled up. We have some, especially on the EV battery side, a couple of them, actually, have been canceled. But we also have new ones that are coming in. So, it's dynamic, but we continue to win in the megaproject space, right? Again, verticals we've always been strong in. But a lot of these decisions are made on a global basis. So, you have decision makers that live in different parts of the world. Again, a direct sales force that could help triage those decision makers is extremely important. And we've been very successful, and I anticipate, and I know we'll be very successful in the future as well. Joe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful. And look, I know you're not talking about a prebuy on the residential side of the business and yet the industry is seeing pretty significant growth in the back half of this year in resi and a few of your competitors are talking about how much of the kind of [R-54B] (ph) is going to go through their system next year. With one saying 65% of their business, the other one is saying 90% of their business. I'm just kind of curious as you kind of think about your resi business since the next year, like how much of it do you think is going to be the 410A product that you'll manufacture this year versus the R-54B product that will be hitting the market next year? Any thoughts? Dave Regnery : Yeah. I mean if you think about inventory in the channel, think about three months of inventory is probably a good average to use, so by definition, you're going to be at 75%. Now, it won't probably be linear, where it will be all in the back half. You'll have some of the 410 that will sell throughout the year. But look, we'll probably be in that 75%, 80% range in resi. In commercial, and by the way, no one wants to take well commercial, but commercial also went through a refrigerant change on the unitary side. And that one will obviously be a lot higher, think of that one in the 90%-plus range. Joe Ritchie : Helpful. Thank you very much. Dave Regnery : Okay. Thanks, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Look, I know I know APAC and China are very small for you, so [I'll probably come] (ph) back to this, but I guess the surprise is that it took so long because we've seen terrible markets in China now for some time. So, you mentioned you've been outperforming. That makes sense, but obviously, the string broke this quarter. So, it seems -- if you have to gauge how much of this is elective, enforcing more stringent credit procedures versus genuine deterioration in the market, how would you sort of gauge that? And I'm guessing that this correction has to cycle through into 2025, there's no kind of spring back here. Just any thoughts there? Dave Regnery : Yeah. I mean, I think the fourth quarter will be stronger than the third quarter. I mean just -- I mean, Nigel, you kind of hit it. Look, China is 4% of our revenue, first of all. So, it's a small portion of our income, but it's important. And how much of the downturn is market related versus our policy change, it's always hard to say that. I don't know, is it 50-50, maybe it's a little bit more weighted to policy change at least in the short term, probably just because we have to work through that. We have to educate our customers as to what the expectations are. So, our teams are really good. Again, a direct sales force can have that direct conversation, they can understand the why and we'll work through it. We'll see how the fourth quarter, as I said, will be a little bit stronger, we think, than the third quarter, and that's what we have baked into our guide. Nigel Coe : Okay. That's great. And then, a follow-up for Chris. Not asking the '25 guidance, but maybe just some of the moving pieces. On corporate, running at $330 million now it was as low as $350 million back in 2022, 2021. So, any sense on what would be a good run rate for corporate? And then, it looks like amort comes down in '25. So, I think some of the Trane acquisition, amort starting to roll off. Is that correct? And then finally, just on interest. We got a refi coming up in November, I think, very small, but should we expect interest expense to go up a little bit next year? Chris Kuehn : Hey, Nigel. Yeah, corporate, I think, $300 million is probably a good longer-term run rate number. I mean, there are times like this year where we have a little bit higher corporate expense and think of that as where we're driving some of the enterprise investments for the company. So, those are decisions we'll make as we work throughout a year always making sure that, that pipeline of investments is getting funded. So -- but I think going into 2025, a squiggle of $300 million is probably a good place to start. We'll update you as we get together in a few months from now. On amortization, yes, there's going to be a little bit of a roll-off on the Tarne amortization. We'd have to look at that across the new M&A that we've done over the last few years and dial that all in. So yeah, we'll give you some more input on that over the next few months, see if there's any more M&A that comes through the balance of this year. And then, on the interest side, yeah, we -- I would say we had $237 million of guided interest expense for this year. We took out some debt proactively earlier this year just to derisk a refinance that actually is going to come due here in a couple of days. We've held on to that cash actually this year from the bond offering we did in June. It's a net positive on net interest here. So, we'll pay down that cash and pay down that bond going into next year. But maybe that number for 2024 is not far off from what we have for 2025. But we'll see. We'll dial it in. The good thing is, is that we've generated a lot of cash this year, maybe earlier than normal. It's generated a little bit more interest income as well as we've earned it this year. But we have a pristine balance sheet, very strong leverage on the balance sheet, a lot of firepower to go deploy cash. And I would say maybe for next year, interest is probably in that ballpark is 2024. Nigel Coe : That's great. Thanks, Chris. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Nigel. Chris Kuehn : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sahil Manocha : Hi. Good morning. This is Sahil Manocha on for Deane Dray. My question is on weakness in China, understanding it's a smaller part of the business, but have you taken any write-downs of receivables or increased reserves? And how might the Chinese government stimulus actions play out? And are there any verticals in China doing particularly worse? Chris Kuehn : Why don't I start? This is Chris. The first answer is no. We've not seen any material write-downs or bad debt reserves. I think the key there is coming out of the second quarter, working with our business team in China to make sure that they were deploying these tightened credit policies really at the end of the second quarter. And so, we've got orders that are waiting to be delivered. And when the cash comes in, we'll deliver them. So, at this point, no, we're not seeing that. We generally play in the non-resi markets in China and largely commercial HVAC with a smaller transport business. And those are the markets that have been, as you may have seen here in the last several months, the non-resi markets are just seeing a bit of a downturn. So, we've been outperforming for some time. At some point, it does catch up with you a little bit. But to Dave's prior comments, we're also making sure we're focused on the long term here. We don't want to create a short-term problem that's a booking or revenue that three, six, nine months down the road, you wind up with a problem you have to deal with. We're making sure we've got quality orders, quality customers, quality receivables and then ultimately driving the cash. Sahil Manocha : That's really helpful. And then, one more on data centers. Could you provide an update on your liquid cooling investment in LiquidStack? Dave Regnery : Yeah. We continue to work with LiquidStack. We've been partners with them for an extended period of time now. I think the activity is starting to pick up there, but there's some hurdles that we're still working through with them, and we'll keep you posted, but not really any kind of an update right now as far as orders are concerned. Sahil Manocha : All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Andrew Obin : Hey, guys. Good morning. Dave Regnery : Hey, Andrew. How are you? Andrew Obin : I am going to sort of belabor this China point a little bit more. My understanding was that for you, China was mostly industrial exposure. And I think the prior explanation for the fact that your performance in China was better was because you did not have exposure to these non-residential office buildings. I just want to understand if that's the right way of thinking about it. And yeah, right, because, as I said, the commercial weakness was there. Your response was we're not really on this commercial developments. We're playing mostly on the industrial side. But did I just understand it wrong? Dave Regnery : No, it's about -- think about our business in China, think about 90% commercial HVAC, okay, mostly applied systems. So, you're spot on there. Look, the downturn, the markets are down, okay? That's pretty universal as to what's happening in China. But as I said earlier, Andrew, if a customer wasn't going to provide the downpayment, okay, or the progress payment, even though the product was ready to be shipped, we've held it, okay? We're not going to ship it until we get that progress payment. And you saw the acute falloff in the quarter because of that. But again, long term, this is a prudent decision that we're making. And the individual before for Dean was asking about it, have we written off anything in bad debt, and the answer is no, and we don't intend to in the future. Andrew Obin : No, I understand, but the answer is that all along your China business was mostly commercial real estate, not industrial facilities, not factories, not data centers, it's 90% commercial real estate. Just want to get that point. Is that correct? Dave Regnery : No, that's false. No, we're actually the reverse. We don't really play in the commercial real estate place. These are applied systems. So, think of them semiconductor, think of them industrial applications... Andrew Obin : No, that's exactly what I was asking. Thank you. Yes, that was my understanding. Okay. Fine. So, it's really industrial weakness. It's weakness outside the real estate market that's getting you down? Dave Regnery : You got it. Andrew Obin : Okay. Thank you. No, that's exactly what -- and maybe just A2L pricing, there's been a lot of data points. I think there was a view that Daikin, right, because they use a different refrigerant, maybe is not going to increase their prices as much. I think your peers are sort of saying high single digits, around 10% maybe. What do you guys -- and I apologize if I missed it, but what do you guys fall in on this A2L pricing into '25? Chris Kuehn : Andrew, I mean, think of the introduced pricing for the new refrigerant products really being up in the high-single-digit range. There is more cost associated with the products for many reasons, the refrigerant, the sensors, et cetera. Our target is to be margin neutral here as we think about pricing and cost for end customers. But think of it for us up in that high-single-digit range. As we guide next year, we'll dial in a little bit better based on visibility the percentages that Dave outlined previously of how much will be 454B versus 410A. And then I know, as you know, not all of the residential product we sell is subject to the new refrigerant like furnaces. So we'll kind of walk you through what we think that price contribution is for next year, but it will be a tailwind for next year. Andrew Obin : Terrific. And I really appreciate this clarification in China. Thanks a lot. Dave Regnery : Sure. No problems, Andrew. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Tommy Moll from Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Tommy Moll : Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Dave Regnery : How are you doing, Tommy? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Tommy Moll : Doing fine. Thank you. We've talked a lot about China. So, I wanted to circle back on one of the positive topics from today, which is the backlog you've called out for 2025, which was up sequentially by a pretty large amount. And I'm just curious, as you look at the composition there, is there anything we can learn in terms of what verticals are particularly strong? Why customers may be ordering a little bit earlier in the cycle than in the past? Just anything we can glean? Obviously, you've talked about next year is a strong one for commercial HVAC, but maybe if we go one layer deeper there, what can we learn? Dave Regnery : Yeah. I think, as I said earlier, if you think about our order rates, and I'll talk about commercial HVAC in the Americas, they're up close to 20% for the year. It's broad-based. It's in basically all verticals. So -- and the other thing, Tommy, that I haven't talked about is that our pipeline, so this is before something actually becomes an order, is extremely strong, right? We have very sophisticated CRM systems. So, we know what's being worked on. And it is extremely strong, which gives me lots of confidence not only for the fourth quarter but into 2025 as to what we should be expecting in that business. So, I'm very bullish on 2025. We'll dial that in as we get into our fourth quarter earnings. But look, our backlog is up $300 million year-to-date. It's hard to say what's normal now, but it's -- if we look at historical norms, it's over 2.5 times what's normal. We will go into next year with a very strong backlog and the activity -- the market activity across all verticals is very, very strong right now. Tommy Moll : Which leads to my follow-up, Dave. Office got a little airtime earlier. And so, if we just discuss these commercial trends ex data centers, which we've covered, and think about office and some of the other verticals that we don't talk about as much, am I hearing you correctly that it feels like the rest of that commercial business has actually gotten stronger in terms of the orders as 2024 has progressed? Dave Regnery : Certainly, office has. I think all of our verticals have positive growth -- except for one, had positive growth on a year-over-year basis, which is encouraging. But again, it kind of comes back to who we are as Trane Technologies, right? We are very broad-based, right? Our portfolio of products and services is broad-based. We have expertise in all verticals. And it's not like we've become over-indexed on any one. And I know that data centers are certainly very strong, and it will be very strong in the future. We have a great team there that works on the data center. We also have great teams that work on other verticals and have that expertise. And by the way, if they see opportunities, they're going to pivot to that opportunity and really go after it and make sure that they can win with the customer. So very strong, we're seeing right now. Backlog is very strong. activity, this is before an order is extremely strong and we're bullish. Tommy Moll : Thank you, Dave. I'll turn it back. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Tommy. Operator : Our last question today will come from Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Noah Kaye : Thanks, and I will give it to one question. Dave, in the past, we've talked a little bit about a cascading impact of policies going from, say, ESSER to CHIPS and IRA. And I know there are a lot of fundamental drivers here around decarbonization and improved efficiency paybacks. But just at this point, as we look at '25 and your comments around the pipeline of activity, to what extent are those policy impacts actually impacting the pipeline or the bookings you're seeing? Just help us level set what kind of impact they're actually having on the business? Dave Regnery : I'm sure they have a tailwind. But again, our solutions have great paybacks with or without those tailwinds. Obviously, the tailwind makes it more attractive, but we have great paybacks for existing -- whether we have a tailwind or not like ESSER funding. Certainly, some of them have been part of the -- ESSER funding is a great example there where it certainly is part of our backlog. We'll be fulfilling orders all the way through probably about the next year that's in our backlog for schools. And a lot of that has to do -- I know it sounds like a long time, but remember, in schools, you tend to want to do the work when students aren't in the school. So, it will be like the school season in the summer. But look, we'll see what happens with who the next party is in Washington, but we're optimistic that we'll continue to have attractive paybacks regardless of what the policies are, whether they are tailwinds or not, but we'll be successful well into the future. Noah Kaye : All right. Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Noah. Operator : We are out of time for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As always, we'll be available for questions at any time. We'll also be on the road quite a bit in the fourth quarter, and we look forward to seeing many of you on the road. So, have a great day. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities law. Please see our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, which are explained in the financial tables attached to our news release. Joining me on today's call are Dave Regnery, Chair and CEO; and Chris Kuehn, Executive Vice President and CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Zac, and, everyone, for joining today's call. Please turn to Slide 3. I'd like to begin with a few minutes on our purpose-driven strategy, which enables our differentiated financial results over time. At Trane Technologies, we continuously innovate for a sustainable world. And our innovation is driving significant customer demand. We are the partner of choice to ensure optimal performance while reducing energy use and emissions. Our customers know that our solutions are green for green, good for the planet, and good for the bottom line. Our relentless investment in innovation powers our flywheel of market outperformance and strong free cash flow. With this momentum, our proven business operating system and our uplifting culture, we are well positioned to deliver a leading growth profile and differentiated shareholder value into the future. Please turn to Slide 4. We expect to deliver top-quartile financial performance over the long term, consistently and reliably for our shareholders. This is core to our culture and central to how we set our targets and execute our strategy across our global portfolio. 2024 was a standout year for the company. I'm proud of how our global teams exceeded our targets, top to bottom. We closely track top quartile performance against our core peer group and believe our performance will rank in the top quartile on organic revenue growth, up 12% as well as adjusted EPS growth up 24%. We also delivered free cash flow of $2.8 billion or 109% free cash flow conversion, enabling us to make key strategic M&A investments while raising our dividend and returning significant cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Please turn to Slide 5. Relentless investment in innovation, growth, people, culture and our business operating system have yielded clear benefits over time, demonstrated by our strong track record. Since 2020, we've delivered a revenue compound annual growth rate of 12%, expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins by 400 basis points and delivered free cash flow conversion of 108%, while deploying approximately $12 billion of capital. We believe that consistent business reinvestment is key to our long-term success. For over a decade, we've added a high level of incremental investments each year in high-ROI projects. This has resulted in a world-class direct sales force channel and service organization. It has also enabled us to develop cutting-edge solutions for the most pressing customer challenges, driving strong demand. We have all the essential ingredients to execute our strategy and continue driving differentiated returns for our shareholders over the long term. Please turn to Slide 6. We delivered robust financial results in the fourth quarter, extending our strong track record of execution and industry-leading revenue and EPS growth. Our global team achieved 10% organic revenue growth, 110 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and 20% adjusted EPS growth. Organic bookings for full year 2024 were strong, up 11% with a book-to-bill ratio of 102% on top of 12% organic revenue growth. This contributed to a highly elevated backlog of $6.75 billion entering 2025. We saw a strong performance across our segments, led by our Commercial HVAC businesses. Fourth quarter Americas and EMEA organic Commercial HVAC bookings were both strong, each up more than 30% on a three-year stack. Fourth quarter organic revenues were exceptional, with Americas Commercial HVAC up mid-50% on a three-year stack and EMEA Commercial HVAC up more than 60% over the same period. Our teams are excelling in complex bespoke applied projects, which are key to the multi-year CapEx cycle, especially in high-growth verticals. For instance, three-year stack organic revenue growth in applied systems for our Americas and EMEA Commercial HVAC businesses is up over 120% and 90%, respectively. Applied systems offer a durable service tail of eight times to 10 times the initial equipment cost over their lifespan, meaning our strong growth in applied solutions presents tremendous service opportunities with higher margins that are largely still ahead of us. Looking beyond the continued strength in Commercial HVAC, we see several tailwinds in 2025. We believe residential markets have largely normalized and are returning to our long-term framework of GDP plus growth. The Americas transport refrigeration markets are expected to bottom in the first half of 2025, paving the way for a second-half recovery and strong growth in 2026 and 2027. In addition, the challenges associated with our actions in the second half of 2024 to tighten credit policies in China are improving ahead of our initial expectations. Given our consistent performance over time, we are confident in our ability to deliver strong results in 2025. We are initiating a strong guide for the year, which Chris will cover in more detail in a few minutes. Please turn to Slide 7. Demand for our innovative solutions was broad-based across our segments in the fourth quarter. In our Americas segment, Commercial HVAC bookings were up high-single-digits. Revenues were up mid-teens in both equipment and services. Residential revenues were up low-teens, consistent with the second and third quarters. Transport refrigeration bookings were down high 20s after being up high 20s in the third quarter, reflecting the inherent lumpiness associated with the timing of large customer orders in this business. Revenues were down low-teens, outperforming end markets, which were down more than 20% in the quarter. In EMEA, Commercial HVAC bookings were up mid-single-digits in the quarter versus a tough prior year comp. Two-year stack bookings were up 20%. Revenue was also strong, up low-teens. Our transport business performed in line with our expectations with revenues down low single digits. In Asia Pacific, our team demonstrated resilience, achieving strong sequential improvement. Bookings in the region were up 8% and revenues were up 1%. Strength in the rest of Asia more than compensated for the softness in China, where bookings were down low-single-digits and revenues declined by low-teens. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide 8. This slide provides a snapshot of our fourth-quarter performance, showcasing strong execution across the board. Organic revenues were up 10%, adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 110 basis points and adjusted EPS rose by 20%. At the enterprise level, we achieved robust organic revenue growth in both equipment and services, up high single-digits and low-teens respectively. Our high-performance flywheel continues to yield results with relentless investments in innovation driving top-line growth, margin expansion, and EPS growth. Please turn to Slide 9. At the enterprise level, we achieved robust volume growth, positive price realization, and productivity gains that offset inflation and high levels of business reinvestment. In the Americas, we delivered 9 points of volume growth and 2 points of price. Strong performance in commercial HVAC and residential was partially offset by softer transport results. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 140 basis points, driven by volume growth, productivity, and price realization. In EMEA we delivered 6 points of volume growth and 1 point of price with strong commercial HVAC performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 20 basis points, driven by volume growth, productivity, and price realization. In Asia Pacific, we delivered 1 point of price and volume was flat. EBITDA margin expansion was driven by price realization and strong productivity, more than offsetting inflation and business reinvestment. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide 10. This slide outlines the key dynamics shaping our market outlook and guidance for 2025. In the Americas, we anticipate continued strong execution and broad-based strength in core markets with particular momentum in high-growth verticals. Our world-class direct sales force and leading innovation are powerful competitive advantages that enable us to optimize opportunities and drive market outperformance. We expect residential markets to return to a GDP-plus framework in 2025, following a modest pre-buy of around $75 million to $100 million in Q3 and Q4 of 2024. Most of this pre-buy is expected to impact the first quarter of 2025. For the full year, we see mid-single-digit growth in the residential business with a tailwind from the low GWP mix. Turning to transport, we expect relative flat markets in 2025, plus or minus low single digits. The market should bottom in Q1, down about 25% year-over-year, then rebound in the second half aligning with freight market recovery forecasts. While the exact timing and speed are uncertain, ACT predicts a sharp recovery in both 2026 and 2027, up mid-teens each year. We've continued to invest heavily during the market downturn and we are well-positioned to outperform as the market comes back. In EMEA, we expect continued strength in commercial HVAC in 2025, driven by strong execution in core markets and tailwinds from thermal management systems, services, and key growth verticals. EMEA transport markets are expected to be flat to up low-single digits in 2025 and we expect to outperform. In Asia, we anticipate a flattish market for the year due to a soft macro backdrop and our tightened credit policies impacting the first half of 2025. We expect muted performance in China to be offset by growth in the rest of Asia. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Chris. Chris? Chris Kuehn : Thanks, Dave. Please turn to Slide 11. Our 2025 guidance reflects the market dynamics outlined on the prior slide and our optimism about our ability to outperform. It also incorporates our value creation flywheel, emphasizing continued investment in innovation, market outgrowth, healthy leverage, and strong free cash flow. We are initiating 2025 guidance with 7% to 8% organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share of $12.70 to $12.90, representing approximately 13% to 15% EPS growth. This includes about 100 basis points of negative FX and roughly 50 basis points of growth from M&A impacting revenue, which together are expected to negatively impact earnings by about $0.20 for the year. We are targeting organic leverage of 25% or higher, consistent with our long-term goals. We anticipate another year of 100% or greater free cash flow conversion in 2025. Looking at the first quarter of 2025, we expect approximately 6% to 7% organic revenue growth, driven by continued strength in commercial HVAC. We expect adjusted EPS in the first quarter to be between $2.15 and $2.20 with a midpoint of $2.17. This midpoint represents about 17% of our full year guidance ahead of our three-year and five-year historical averages of approximately 15% to 16%. Overall, we believe our Q1 guidance is strong and an achievable start to the year. For additional details related to our guidance, please refer to Slide 18. Please go to Slide 12. We remain committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy focused on deploying excess cash to maximize shareholder returns. First, we strengthened our core business through relentless reinvestment. Second, we maintain a strong balance sheet to ensure flexibility as markets evolve. Third, we expect to deploy 100% of excess cash over time. Our approach includes strategic M&A to enhance long-term returns and share repurchases when the stock trades below intrinsic value. Please turn to Slide 13. In 2024, we deployed or committed approximately $2.5 billion through our balanced capital allocation strategy with approximately $800 million to dividends, $470 million to M&A, and $1.3 billion to share repurchases. We made several strategic bolt-on acquisitions, enhancing our AI and digital building management capabilities, expanding specialized refrigerated transport, and making multiple channel investments. Our M&A pipeline remains active and we will continue to be disciplined in our approach. In addition, with $6.2 billion remaining under repurchase authorizations, we have strong flexibility as our shares trade below our calculated intrinsic value. For 2025, we expect to deploy between $2.5 billion and $3 billion in capital. Our strong free cash flow, liquidity, balance sheet, and significant share repurchase authorization provide excellent capital allocation optionality moving forward. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave. Dave? Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Please turn to Slide 15. We've already covered our transport market expectations in the Americas and EMEA on Slide 10. So I'll keep my comments brief. While the Americas transport refrigeration markets have been more volatile in recent years compared to the five years preceding the 2020 pandemic, the long-term outlook remains strong. ACT forecasts show an average of 44,000 trailer units per year over a 15-year period. For 2026 and 2027, ACT projects mid-teens growth. The future looks bright and we're excited about the opportunities ahead. Please turn to Slide 16. In summary, we are well-positioned to deliver leading performance and differentiated shareholder returns in 2025 and beyond. Our uplifting and engaging culture, combined with our leading innovation and proven business operating system continue to set us apart. I'm proud of our team's consistent track record of growth, including our standout performance in 2024. And I truly believe our brightest days are still ahead. And now we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Chris Snyder : Thank you for the question. I wanted to ask on service with Q4 up low-teens again. I think America was in the mid-teens in Q4. And service has now grown at a double-digit rate for the last three to four years. And Dave, I know you typically talk about high single-digit service growth. I'm just wanted to get a sense for the outlook here and what's baked into this 2025 guide on service, which I know in the past, you've said hasn't usually lags equipment by a couple of years. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Hi, Chris, how are you doing? Thanks for the question. Yes, I'm so proud of our service business. Just the growth rates that we've seen there. Chris makes me use a seven-year CAGR on that. So that's where the high single digits comes from and it's very high, high single digits. But look, we were up mid-teens or low-teens, I'm sorry, in the fourth quarter low-teens for the full year. Our service business now from a dollar basis is $6.5 billion. And just tremendous growth that we're seeing there. And if you think about our backlog, right, which is predominantly on commercial HVAC, predominantly applied, that's really where our service business was designed around our applied solutions. And the more complex those solutions become, the more propensity for the OEM to do the service work. So - but we'll keep our guide at the high-single-digits, but think about $6.5 billion that's growing at a close to 10% rate per year in the last couple of years have been in that double-digit range. As you said, it's a very resilient business. And I can tell you that we're operating very well there as part of our operating system, the cadence that we have there, and we're really hitting on all cylinders right now. Chris Snyder : No, really, really appreciate that. And then maybe turning over to the commercial HVAC equipment. Orders this quarter, high singles a bit better than last quarter, low singles, comp seems to be the same. I know there's always a lot of focus on data center, but you guys do, obviously, I think you talked to 13 or 14 commercial verticals. So was that improvement - is that just project lumpiness? Or when you look across those verticals, do you see positive rates have changed across some of them? Thank you. Dave Regnery : Chris, great question. Look, our order grade for Commercial HVAC in the Americas was up high single digits. On a two-year stack, it's over 20%. On a three-year stack, it's over 30%. So we continue to see tremendous growth in our Commercial HVAC business. As far as the verticals, yes, we track 14 different verticals and we're seeing growth, yes, we're seeing growth in data centers. It's been a strong vertical for us in the past. It's going to be a strong vertical for us in the future. But we're seeing broad-based growth. And if you think about it, I mean, the revenue for the Americas for the year was up over 20% and we had growth in 13 of the 14 verticals. The only vertical that did not show growth was Life Science and it's been challenged all year, but we're very optimistic about the future there. So think about that. We're showing broad-based growth and you would expect that from Trane Technologies with the broad-based portfolio of products and services that we have. We didn't design our portfolio of products to serve a particular vertical. We designed it to serve the market, and that's exactly what we're doing. And if you take that with our direct sales force with deep domain expertise knowledge at both a technical level and then within a vertical level, you could understand why we're being able to have this broad-based growth. So we're very excited about what we're seeing in Commercial HVAC. The team is performing very well. And the pipeline too is very, very strong. So we obviously - we report orders, but the pipeline is what the team is working on and that remains very, very robust. Chris Kuehn : Chris, I would add - think about our applied solutions, which impact many of those 14 verticals. Revenues in applied are up over 120% in the Americas, Commercial HVAC business over the last three years. In the EMEA business, it's up more than 90%. And that is building an installed base that then drive services that think of that as a few years after the installed base, the service revenues start to apply post-warranty period. That's largely in front of us. So it's a very durable tail, as Dave described, and really excited that, again, applied serves multiple verticals. Chris Snyder : Thank you guys. Really, really appreciate that. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Chris. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead. Julian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just a first question around the sort of organic sales guide through the year. So I think a lot of investors would have expected maybe a slow start to the year and then an acceleration because of resi HVAC recovering from the pre-buy headwind and TK picking up a bit. But your organic growth guide looks very steady through the year, just a point less in Q1. So trying to understand - does that reflect not a big headwind from resi HVAC and TK in Q1? Or does it just reflect some conservatism when we're thinking about the second half and the Commercial HVAC sales growth? Chris Kuehn : Yes. Hi, Julian, it's Chris. I'll start. Yes, think about the first quarter, and I'll start with residential, right? Dave called out the pre-buy estimate that we had around $75 million to $100 million. We expect that should largely impact the first quarter. It may extend beyond that, but right now, we're thinking that should largely impact the first quarter. Probably means residential is flat to slightly down in the first quarter. Transport markets, as you described, I mean, we're seeing them bottom out in the first half of the year, probably a bit under-challenged here in the first quarter. But we're seeing continued strength in the Commercial HVAC businesses. So think of them as up high-single-digit could be 10% growth here even in the start of the first quarter. But it's really why we have a range of 6% to 7% organic revenue growth for the first quarter. We think the guide is in the right range. We've got opportunities and multiple ways to get there. But you're right. I mean transport residential, it may have a start that could be a little bit down in the beginning of the year, but a lot of strength coming through Commercial HVAC. And then we have multiple opportunities as we execute to the guide on the full year, as we said was 7% to 8% organic revenue growth, a lot of confidence in our guide for the first quarter and for the full year. Julian Mitchell : Thanks very much. And then just my follow-up would be around the price sort of volume outlook within the organic sales guide. So I think fourth-quarter price was sort of 1 to 2 points across the company, higher than that in the Americas. When we're thinking about the year ahead, is it sort of a similar 1- to 2-point price tailwind in the sales mix? And any sort of concerns about customers, for example, in the resi channels pushing back on price increases? Chris Kuehn : Yes. For the fourth quarter, price was a little bit above 2 points. It really has been coming down over the last couple of years and now at a - for the full year in 2024, it was a little bit above 2 points as well. And the Americas would be really the driver there, a little bit above 2 points in the Americas. And Julian, for 2025, we'd expect pricing to contribute about a point to maybe 1.5 points on the full-year revenue growth outlook. So on 7% to 8%, we get 5.5% to 6% or 6.5% around volume and then 1 to 1.5 points coming from price. It's less of the carryover from 2024 pricing that would impact '25, just given the low nature of the contribution in '24. It's really around the new price increases that we put in place for 2025. On residential, you mentioned that just to be clear on the transition to the lower refrigerants, the 454B refrigerant for us. We're going to report that price increase, which is high single digits for that portfolio. We're going to report that in volume, so that would not be part of price. But think of that as on 65% of the portfolio and then about 75% of the year, three quarters of the year really being impacted by that transition for the A2L refrigerants. So hopefully that gives you a sense. We're probably in that 1 point to 1.5-point price range for the year. Julian Mitchell : That's great. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Julian. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please go ahead. Andrew Kaplowitz : Hi, good morning, everyone. Dave Regnery : Hi, Andy, how you doing? Andrew Kaplowitz : Good, how are you? Dave, Chris, I wanted to ask Chris' question in a slightly different way. I know you have the 14 verticals. But are data center project bookings set to lead growth, for instance, in '25 versus '24? And it seems like education-related bookings are holding up well. There's been some consternation about that. And just on the comps issue, like comps in North America seem like they continue to get a little more difficult. Can you still grow Commercial HVAC bookings in North America even against difficult comps? Dave Regnery : Yes. A lot there, Andy. But look, our - we saw a growth in, like I said, at almost all verticals. So, yes, data centers were strong, but we had a lot of other verticals that were very, very strong. And you hit on one, education. Education has been strong, certainly, ESSER funding was a tailwind there, but even in the fourth quarter, where ESSER funding is now at least from an order standpoint behind us, we still saw growth in fourth-quarter bookings. And I would tell you the pipeline there in education is very, very robust. So look, as far as the - do we think there's opportunities that comps get hard? Look, we still believe there's tremendous opportunities here for growth in all verticals, right? If you think about the megatrends around decarbonization and energy efficiency, they're - they continue to intensify. If you think about reshoring activity in the United States, that continues to intensify. If you think about the multi-year CapEx cycle with mega projects, that continues to have momentum. So we're very bullish on our commercial HVAC business. I would tell you that the portfolio of products and the innovation that we have there, I know I said in my prepared remarks, we are green for green. When you have a solution that's very sustainable for the planet and has a great payback for the customer, it's the greatest place to be. And that's what we have at Trane Technology. So, I'm very bullish about the future. Andrew Kaplowitz : Very helpful, Dave. And then just focusing on margin. APAC margin was obviously surprisingly strong in Q4. Maybe just comment on the durability of those margins in '25? And then I think your incremental margin dropped a little in Americas and EMEA in Q4. Is that just, you mentioned transport mix, is that really what it is, but you also talked about investments quite a bit. Could you quantify how much they were and what you're thinking for '25? Chris Kuehn : Yes, Andy, I'll start. I'll soon start with Asia. We expected sequential improvements in Asia in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and our team in Asia just has even outperformed those expectations. It's still going to take some time to continue to normalize in China the tightened credit policy. So that will probably extend into the first half of 2025. But their decisions were the right decisions you're seeing that come through on sequential improvement versus what we saw in the third quarter. Margins, look, that team has just been outstanding in terms of managing their productivity, their investments, and ultimately still investing in the business. So let's see where margins go for going forward. There's certainly leading margins across the regions and it gives us a lot of confidence that EMEA and Americas can continue to grow their margins into the future as well given, just to recall, our Asia business is largely Commercial HVAC that they're selling into the region. For the other markets, very strong results in terms of margin expansion. We're driving all of those businesses for 25% or better leverage into 2025. We like that framework. The last couple of years, we've - actually, we've taken the lid off of investments. We're making sure that we can drive strong leverage and also accelerating as many investments as we can, and that's really across all three of our regions. Otherwise, I think that hopefully answers the question. We have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to grow the margins and really the leverage with the investments we're making. Dave Regnery : Yes, I'll just add that, look. I'm super proud of the team in Asia. I know Asia, it's only 8% of our revenue, 50% of that's China, 50% is outside the rest of Asia. But I mean just great performance. I mean, the rest of Asia had 10% growth and had order growth in the high teens. So very strong performance there. And as Chris commented, the team in China just executed very well, implementing our new credit policy and the credit tightening is the right reason and I was very - the right prudent thing to do. And I was very clear on the third quarter if we don't have an order, we're not going to - we don't have a down payment, we're not going to take the order. And in the fourth quarter, we made some adjustments to our backlog to make sure that everything in the backlog had down payments in it. So that team is just executing at a very high level. Andrew Kaplowitz : Appreciate the color, guys. Dave Regnery : Sure. Chris Kuehn : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with UBS. Please go ahead. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Dave, can you talk about the margin, just coming back to the service conversation at the front of the call. Just trying to understand the margin opportunity in the service business over time. I know there's a lot of investments in technology to make technicians more efficient, maybe predictive maintenance. But hoping you could just speak to the runway there just given obviously, it's a third of the business and the installed base is growing quite rapidly and a few years from now, it could be quite larger. So if you can talk about that? Chris Kuehn : Hi, Amit, it's Chris. I'll start. Yes, look, we like the margins in the service business. It's higher margins when you think about what we're delivering to customers and making sure that their products are running efficiently. As Dave has described in the past, the service business is rapidly evolving from running to go fix something that's not working effectively to now making sure that the equipment is always optimized, right. It may be running, you may think it's up, it's operating well, but the fact is it may be operating inefficiently and therefore, that's a really nice opportunity for us. So it gives us a lot of confidence that we should be driving organic leverage 25%, or better. And a reminder, services is a third of the enterprise revenues. It remains a third of the enterprise revenues. And you're right, the investments that we've been making across our portfolio also include investments in our service portfolio. So think about service technicians, think about front-end tools, digital in terms of diagnostics, it's an area that again, that's a great area to take the lid off and keep investing in that part of our portfolio. Dave Regnery : Yes, Amit, one of the things that we announced in the quarter two was the closure of an acquisition, BrainBox AI, and that's really going to help our service business as well in the future. So if you think about today, we have 42,000 roughly connected buildings. We have well over 2 million connected assets. We're getting a lot of data at the building level and at the asset level and we'll call that structured data. What AI does is, it augments that with unstructured data. And when you combine that, that's really where you're able to make buildings operate more efficiently. So our service teams will be a big part of that in the future. And I know you've probably heard me speak in the past about demand side management. Look, we've done hundreds of thousands of energy audits and we know that about 30% of the energy consumed after the meter is being wasted. And our goal is to help decarbonize that built environment and to get everything back to where the way it was designed to operate. And if we can save that 30%, there's so much opportunity there well into the future. Amit Mehrotra : And then just related to that because obviously, paybacks are so compelling today, which is what's driving a lot of the growth. But there is this expectation that power prices will continue to go up over the next several years. I guess the BrainBox acquisition probably allows the equipment to run even more efficiently. Can you just talk about how you think the payback map evolves over the next few years? Because there's, the question you routinely get is how long is it sustainable, but if paybacks can actually improve, I wonder if this growth can actually reaccelerate. Dave Regnery : Well, I think you're spot on. I don't think anyone is projecting that the cost of energy is - or at least electricity is going to go down in the future, right. So you think of the paybacks, it's actually going to become more punitive if you're not running the system the way it was designed. So the paybacks will actually increase. So we're - we think there's a tremendous opportunity in demand side management and we're executing to that strategy. BrainBox can be a big part of us. It's a small business today, but we've been really good at taking these technologies, in this case, the technologies on the software side, and scaling it within our channels. So we're really excited about the growth that we're going to see in the future from it. Amit Mehrotra : Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Dave Regnery : Sure. Thanks, Amit. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead. Scott Davis : Hi, good morning, guys. Dave Regnery : Hi, Scott, how are you doing? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Scott Davis : Good, good. Congrats on a very strong year. Guys, I wanted to go back, I mean, you talked a lot about energy audits, and just makes a ton of sense. It seems like that's kind of what drives the sales cycle. Do you measure internally the number of energy audits that you do kind of each quarter? And is there such a thing as kind of thinking about that as I'll just call it like front log that energy audits are up x percent this quarter and that gives you some additional confidence on the backlog or - on the front log, backlog? Dave Regnery : Yes. It's a great question, Scott. But obviously, we have a lot built into our operating system around our energy management's audits that we do. So, I won't disclose too much there, but absolutely, we track a lot of different metrics, okay, and a lot of them are leading metrics and that would be one of them, but we track a lot of others as well. At the end of the day, it's when you're connected to an asset, you're going to make sure the asset is performing the way it was designed and it's not wasting precious energy. And when you get - when you show that to customers and they start to understand it, it becomes very compelling. And now with the addition of not only the structured or machine learning data that we've been able to derive in the past, this unstructured data that we bring into the equation with BrainBox, it really we're able to drive results that we didn't think were possible three or four years ago. Scott Davis : Dave, can you use AI now to do a digital twin meaningfully faster than you could in the past? Are we there? Are we at that point yet? Dave Regnery : Yes, we do. We do a lot of work with digital twins. I'm not sure if you saw it when you went to 55 Water Street because I think we demonstrated one there. The speed is always getting better and the tools that we're using, obviously, we're using all the tools that we have available to us and AI is one of those tools. So it's certainly, there's other tools as well that have really sped up that process. But it's when you can see it visually and you see the digital twin and then you see the before and after, it's very, very compelling for the customer to understand the impact that we're able to have by constantly monitoring the equipment and constantly making sure it's at the peak performance levels. Scott Davis : Okay. Best of luck this year, guys. Appreciate it. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Scott. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Joe Ritchie : Hi, guys. Good morning. Dave Regnery : Hi, Joe, how are you? Joe Ritchie : Doing great. Thanks, Dave. So look for better or for worse, your stock at times tends to trade with the sentiments surrounding AI, CapEx and data centers. I guess just maybe as you kind of - as you think through like the trajectory of your data center business from here, maybe just give us some color on how you think that you expect that to progress? And then also just on your commercial HVAC backlog, is, are you still well above normal on that backlog in terms of how long cycle it is? Or is it starting to normalize? Dave Regnery : Yes. Why don't I start with the backlog, then I'll get to the data center question. Look, our book-to-bill in 2024 was over 1%, it was 102% and our backlog year-over-year was relatively flat. It's down a little bit. What everyone needs to understand is we had a couple of adjustments that occurred within the backlog, right? There's really three. One is currency worked against us all year. Two is, I've been very clear in Asia, specifically in China, that if we don't have a down payment, we're not including something in our backlog. So we adjusted that out of our backlog. And then the third is the normalization of our transport businesses, which have been under pressure all year. That accounts for about $0.5 billion of backlog adjustments that we took in the year. So if you think about it, our backlog would actually be up year-over-year versus what we're reporting right now. That said, our backlog is very, very elevated, which gives us a lot of visibility into 2025, and that's why Chris and I could speak with so much confidence about the guide that we're putting forward. It gives us great visibility. And the other thing that we track a lot of is the pipelines and these are orders before they become orders, that activity remains very, very robust. As far as data centers go, look, data centers have been a strong vertical for us for decades and they'll be a strong vertical for us well into the future. As far as the news about new competitor coming out of China and the impact that will have, we'll see, I can't comment on that. I could just comment on what we're seeing right now. And we're seeing a lot of growth in data centers and we're seeing a lot of pipeline activity in data centers. I had the opportunity to listen to the earnings call from Meta last night. And if you listen to them, they would say that they're building out their infrastructure and that's part of a competitive advantage that they have. So it doesn't appear as though they're going to be slowing anything down. But we'll wait and see, but everyone needs to understand that we are much more than just data centers. Data centers are strong. They've been strong in the past. We're really good in that vertical. But we're really good in 13 other verticals that we track very, very closely. Joe Ritchie : Super helpful. And bless you to whoever sneezes in the background. The quick question follow-up there is just maybe just a tariff question. Any comments on, like how you see this playing out and any thoughts and your potential exposure there? Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, good question, Joe. Look, we - for decades now, we've had a manufacturing strategy of in-region for-region. So you think about - in the Americas, we have a plant in Mexico. We have over 20 plants in the United States. We have plants throughout Europe. We have plants throughout Asia, some in China, some outside of China. So look, we've - in the past, we've dealt with tariffs. Should they happen, we'll react. Do I think they could impact our supply chain? For sure, there's a little bit of flexibility there, but they will have an impact. But I think we've been able - part of our operating system is we understand our cost inputs. And if we see something change, we're going to react and we're going to act very quickly to make sure that we stay margin-neutral over time. Joe Ritchie : Thanks, guys. Dave Regnery : Thanks, Joe. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Steve Tusa : Hi, good morning. Dave Regnery : Hi, Steve. How are you? Steve Tusa : Good. Always interesting times. So I guess just on this resi guide, roughly, I don't know, 4%-ish on the mix benefit, which you'll call volume a 1.5%, maybe 2% headwind from pre-buy, this is all annual. So what are you thinking about like the market on like a volume basis this year, just like from an underlying demand and replacement events perspective, if you will? Chris Kuehn : Yes, Steve, it's Chris. Yes, you're right, there's three elements that really come into the guide of around mid-single-digit revenue growth for residential. The first one would be that mix tailwind from the A2L refrigerant change, right? You can think of that as maybe around 4 points high single-digit price on 65% of the portfolio multiplied by, say, three-quarters of the year impact gets you to around 4 points. The view around a GDP-plus framework would be the second element. Think of that as maybe 3 to 4 points of growth from returning to GDP, IRA tailwinds, right, that money is at the state level and it's really starting to be deployed. That could be a tailwind for 2025. And then items around consumer confidence, tax cuts, those are all things that could be beneficial to the - to a GDP-plus framework for the year. And then the third element would be the pre-buy dynamic, which is probably around 3 percentage points of a headwind. So altogether, you get into that 4% to 5%-ish range on growth, which is our guide for the year around residential. But to be fair, if it turned out that things were softer in the markets and it wasn't necessarily growth, but it was flattish, and really the impact to our enterprise revenues would be less than a point. It would be 70 basis points or 80 basis points and we really feel comfortable we've got that and it's manageable within our guidance for the year. Steve Tusa : Yes. That makes sense. And what do you guys see in Light Commercial? What's your expectation for the year on Light Commercial? Chris Kuehn : Yes. That's - we certainly think applied markets are going to grow faster than the unitary markets will for 2025. We'll see where it plays out. The best thing about Trane Technologies is we've got the broadest portfolio of products. And unitary versus applied, it's not harder and harder to kind of figure out what the need for the customer is. We're looking at a solution and many of those solutions will involve multiple products to ultimately deliver the energy savings that they need. So let's see, but, probably more growth in applied for 2025 than unitary. Steve Tusa : Okay. And then, sorry, one last thing, given services is such a topic. Dave, you said like 8 to 10 times, I think the multiplier on services. That just seems like a big number for an asset that has like, I don't know, a 30-year useful life that basically people are spending that much money every like three years to service. Is that really like the - considered an annuity or is that more like every five years, they do like a major refurb or something like that? Like how visible is that revenue? Because it just seems like a really big number for a building guy or an equipment owner to spend relative to his initial buy. Dave Regnery : Yes. Just understand 8 to 10 over the life of the asset, right? So the asset is going to add 30 years and the asset cost $1 million, think of it at $8 million in service over that time period. But yes, I mean there is the maintenance that happens. And then obviously, at some point in the useful life, you tend to do our renewals for it where you'll change out controls or make it run more efficiently just because technology continues to advance. So we're very comfortable with that number. We've done a lot of analysis on that with the installed base. So I'm very comfortable with the 8 to 10 times over the life of the asset. Steve Tusa : Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. Dave Regnery : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Sprague : Hi, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Dave Regnery : Hi, Jeff. Chris Kuehn : How's Connecticut, Jeff. Jeffrey Sprague : It's a little chilly. It's warmed up recently, but, we're not needing any HVAC in the, well, we don't need any VAC. We need some H, that's what we need. Dave Regnery : You need a heat pump, Jeff, but go ahead. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. So hi, a lot of ground covered, a little maybe a couple of nits from me. Just first on backlog. I think you include everything in backlog regardless of how far out it reaches. Maybe you could just give a little color on kind of the backlog staging, what's deliverable in '25, and how far out it does reach? Chris Kuehn : Yes, Jeff, it's Chris. I'll start. So $6.75 billion of backlog at the end of 2024. Again, the majority of that, call it, 90% is going to be driven by Commercial HVAC globally. And then of that, it's going to be majority applied systems. That backlog, the majority of it will revenue in 2025. So that's actually fairly consistent with how we've seen the backlog in terms of the growth over the last few years that the majority will turn in 2025. There'll be a small amount that will push out into 2026 and that's really at the customer demand. But the majority of that backlog will turn within 12 months. Dave Regnery : And I mean - and Jeff, remember, we don't have services in the backlog. Jeffrey Sprague : Right. And yes, majority doesn't mean 55%, it means 80%, or 90% or something like that, it sounds like. And then -- Dave Regnery : Yes. It's not a tick above 51, or 50, but no absolutely, right. Jeffrey Sprague : Yes. And could you just also just really in the weeds on resi, how sort of - how did the two-step channel perform in the quarter versus your internal channels as we kind of think about all the pre-buy generations we went through here? Dave Regnery : The pre-buy obviously happened in the two steps or with our IWDs, Independent Wholesale Distributors. Think of that pre-buy that $75 million to $100 million, Jeff, as between Q3 and Q4, all right. We don't think it was all in Q4. It's hard to tell, but because we're estimating, but we think probably about 50% was in Q3, 50% of it was in Q4. But we also think, as Chris said earlier that the majority of that will be impacted in the first quarter. Some of it will probably go into the second quarter, but we can give you guys an update on that when we get to that point. Jeffrey Sprague : Great. I'll leave it there. Good luck this year. Thanks. Dave Regnery : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Nigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning. Lots of questions on services. So here's another one. So I probably should know this, but what is the mix between predictive connected type services versus, I guess, transactional services where there's a phone call from a customer, where there's parts involved, et cetera? So just wondering what that mix is. And does it matter, I mean, is there a growth differential? Is there a margin differential between connected versus transactional? Dave Regnery : Yes, it really doesn't matter, but we haven't disclosed that Nigel, like for a lot of different reasons, but we're strong in both. I mean, obviously, we want to encourage our customers to have agreements because we make sure that the assets we do more maintenance than to make sure that the assets are performing. But obviously, we're going to respond if we get just a cold call saying, hey, my system is down, can you help me? And then what we'll do is, if that happens, the goal is to make sure that we try to sign that customer up for a more comprehensive service agreement over time. Nigel Coe : Okay. And is there a margin differential between whether the contract is more transactional? Dave Regnery : Yes. I'll say no, but there might be one if it's a cold call, okay, depending on what's going on. We try not to because someone is in a dire need charge them more, that's usually not a long-term way to grow a business. So we try to be competitive in both just because we want the customer for life. Nigel Coe : Okay. And then a question on BrainBox. I can't believe I said that, but BrainBox AI. It seems like it's quite a chunky deal. It looks like $300 million, or so EV. So just wondering if you could just give any details on the size, growth profile, how you can like really kind of really expand this business. And then annuity accounting question for Chris, I think. When - this sounds like a very sort of intangible heavy business. So just curious if the intangible amortization is coming down when we think about that step-down in the trade normalization from 15 years ago. Chris Kuehn : Yes, Nigel, I'll start with BrainBox. So less than $300 million from a purchase price, we had another meaningful acquisition that we closed on in the first week of January like we did with BrainBox, actually over in Europe acquiring one of our independent channels there, very similar to a strategy that we have in the U.S. so, but, yes less than that from an EV perspective and not dissimilar to Nuvolo in 2024 with early-stage technology company has a lot of amortization expense. We're expecting that to happen in 2025 for BrainBox. It's part of the guide in terms of the FX headwind and the amortization from the newly-acquired business will have about a $0.20 negative impact on earnings and we've got that incorporated in our guide. But you're right, that's kind of the accounting rules around the acquisition. On the accounting rules, going back to Trane, you're right, we start stepping down on the train amortization in 2025. It's around $25 million or $30 million of lower amortization expense, that's really being offset fully with the investments we've made over the last few years in CapEx and the rising depreciation that comes from that. We've also had a few acquisitions that have some higher amortization as well. So in 2025, the net impact of that benefit from the Trane amortization is really offset and zero. Let's see this in 2026. It's a bigger step-down in '26 on Trane amortization. We'll update you then for next year. But for 2025, it's really a neutral impact. Dave Regnery : Yes. And as far as the growth rates go, Nigel, look, we're pretty excited about it. It's small today, but we like these technology companies that we could scale. We have 42,000 buildings, right. So there's 42,000 potential customers that we already have the data on. We're going to start running algorithms against it to understand what the influence could be with being structured and unstructured data to get. So this is going to be excited, and like I said, it's going to be a nice tail for our service business earlier. Nigel Coe : Great. Thanks, guys. Chris Kuehn : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Deane Dray : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Dave Regnery : Hi, Deane, how are you? Chris Kuehn : Good morning. Deane Dray : Doing, real well. Thank you. Maybe just circle back on the pre-buy. It seems like it was relatively uneventful, at least in terms of how you were positioned. But just - if you just step back, anything that surprised you in terms of the demand, the timing and there's always this nuance about competitive positioning, who cuts over first, but kind of just the post mortem, was there anything that you'd call out in terms of what you were expecting, or what didn't play out? Dave Regnery : Not really, Deane. I mean we've said for a long time we thought it would be a modest pre-buy it was. The team did a nice job of executing the changeover to the A2L refrigerant. We're fully operational on 454B product now. We have the capability of running mixed model lines in our factories, so we can support the aftermarket for 410, which will be needed. But not a lot. I mean, it was pretty much as we predicted. The only thing I would say maybe a little bit different is we probably had more of the pre-buy in Q3 than we anticipated. I didn't realize it was a kind of a pre-buy until we got into Q4. So that would have been the only maybe oddity, but it makes sense though, too, why would you wait till the fourth quarter if you were going to do a pre-buy and you might not have products. So we probably saw more in Q3 than I anticipated. But again, we're talking about relatively small numbers that really don't have a big impact on results. Deane Dray : Good to hear. And I also like hearing that you say 410 is going to be around for a while because I will be a user of that, so. Dave Regnery : So we'll help it out. Well, if you have a Trane part, you probably won't need it to have it worked on for a while, but if you ever do. Deane Dray : Good. It may happen to be one of your units. So that's good to hear. And then just second question, just circling back on China and that whole tightening the credit. It seems to have played out exactly the way you said you would be getting the down payments and maybe some progress payments. But did you - when I hear about tightening credit, that also makes me think that you actually turned down some customers, or maybe shying away from particular verticals. So has there been any selectivity going on maybe related to this credit sensitivity? Dave Regnery : Yes. I mean, at the end of the day, we're just - we're looking we say we call it tightening credit. What we're doing there is we're requiring down payments, right. We're requiring a down payment when the order comes in and we're requiring an additional down payment before the order will ship. So it's not specific to any one vertical or any one channel, that's just the rules of the game that we're operating with. And the team is doing a nice job of educating our customers as to the why. And we made nice progress in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. We have some work in front of us in the first half of 2025, but this is the --this is our new way of doing business in China. Deane Dray : Great. I appreciate that color. Thank you. Dave Regnery : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead. Tommy Moll : Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Dave Regnery : Hi, Tommy, how are you? Tommy Moll : Doing fine. Thank you. Chris, you called out early in the call that if we look at the first quarter earnings contribution as a fraction of the full-year outlook you've provided. It's a bit higher than the average. I've thought about it differently just given the transport and resi headwinds in the first quarter. So is there something we're missing that changes as you go into Qs Q2, Q3, Q4? Or is it perhaps some conservatism just about what's longer-dated here? Just help us triangulate there. Thank you. Chris Kuehn : Yes. We wanted to call out, Tommy, that EPS as a percent of the full-year guide is around 17%. It's normally 15% to 16%. So we are starting the first quarter a little bit ahead of that three-year and five-year average, which we just wanted to make sure everyone understood. It's a strong guide for the first quarter and we have a lot of confidence in it. As you work throughout the year though, the transport markets are going to be expected to be down in the first half. There's expected recovery starting in the second half of the year, roughly flattish, maybe plus or minus low-single-digits for the full year, but growth in the second half. And really what's exciting is the growth expectations for 2026 and 2027 in the transport markets in the Americas. So we'll see how the year plays out. But, yes, there's more of a headwind in the first half of the year from transport. Residential, in the first quarter, a little bit more of a headwind from that pre-buy, right? We think that will largely impact the first quarter. It may drip into the second quarter or beyond. We'll update as we go throughout the year, but that will really normalize, let's say, by the second half of the year and we'll see where growth is based on market conditions and then the tailwind we're getting from the A2L pricing. So those are the two that would stand out to me. Maybe the third would be Asia. Again that new business in China and our team again executing very well there, that could be a little more headwind in the first half of the year, much easier comps as you get into the second half of the year in Asia. So I think those three would probably really be the dynamics I'd call out now. Tommy Moll : Thank you, Chris. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the comment made on some recent investments in channel. I just want to ask if there's anything more you can share there. Dave, I think you mentioned one investment in Europe. But if there's anything you want to call out in terms of a strategy update there, please do. Or if this is same as before and just some opportunistic transactions, let us know that. Thanks. Dave Regnery : Yes. Look, we've been buying up our independence in our Commercial HVAC business for a long time. And these are great businesses. They've had great leaders and just it's opportunistic for us to buy them off. So nothing has changed there with our strategy. There's not a lot of them left, unfortunately, because they're great acquisitions and they become accretive very, very quickly, like almost instantaneously. But that's just more - it's just more of the same and we just had one this time, it was actually in Belgium over in Europe. Chris Kuehn : Yes. For January. So think of it as we've been 95% plus direct and it's these last few percentage points of those independent channels that when they're ready, we're ready to kind of fully bring them into the Trane business. Tommy Moll : Thank you both. I'll turn it back. Dave Regnery : Sure. Thanks, Tom. Operator : And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the conference back over to Zac Nagle for closing remarks. Zac Nagle : Thanks, operator. I'd like to thank everyone for joining today's call. As usual, we'll be available to answer any questions you may have in the coming days and frankly in the coming weeks. We'll also be on the road in the next couple of months attending conferences and other things. And so, we hope to see you in person very soon. So hope everyone has a great day. Thank you. Operator : This will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",
