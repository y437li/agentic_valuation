My name is Michelle, and I\u2019ll be your conference coordinator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Carolynne Borders, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please proceed. Carolynne Borders : Thanks, Michelle. Welcome to GE HealthCare\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. I\u2019m joined by our President and CEO, Peter Arduini; and Vice President and CFO, Helmut Zodl. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the presentation slides available on our website. During this call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Peter. Peter Arduini : Thank you, Carolynne, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first earnings call as an independent publicly traded company. I\u2019m incredibly proud of the work our team has done to complete the spin-off of GE HealthCare. The energy across the company is palpable and there\u2019s tremendous excitement and focus around our purpose to create a world where healthcare has no limits. I want to thank all of our team for their commitment to the customers and patients we serve as we chart our own path forward and execute on our precision care strategy. Let\u2019s start with our fourth quarter 2022 performance. We delivered strong organic revenue growth of 13% year-over-year, reflecting an acceleration from prior quarters in 2022. These results were driven by continued robust demand, backlog fulfillment and improved pricing. In addition, supply chain pressures that we experienced earlier in the year eased continuing the trend that we experienced in the third quarter. Adjusted EBIT margin was 17.1%. Volume and price improved in the fourth quarter, but this was offset by inflation, mix, planned R&D investments and some foreign exchange headwinds. We saw sequential margin improvement as volume and price grew and logistics cost eased with the disciplined optimization actions we\u2019ve taken across the business. This result is equivalent to 16.1% on a standalone basis. Adjusted EPS was $1.31 impacted by incremental interest from debt issuance, partially offset by volume and price. In order to facilitate comparability on a go-forward basis, we\u2019ve also provided a standalone adjusted EPS result of $1.06. Free cash flow was $987 million in the fourth quarter as we start to see supply chain issues ease and we improved collections year-over-year. Total company book-to-bill, which is a calculation of orders to revenues growth, was 1.07 times led by strong orders growth in imaging and ultrasound. For the full year, organic revenues grew 7% year-over-year at the higher end of our mid-single-digit growth target. And while China was impacted by COVID for most of the year, we saw increased momentum coming out of the fourth quarter and we expect that to continue. Globally, we have a healthy backlog heading into 2023 as customers continue to invest in imaging ultrasound as well as PCS. 2022 adjusted EBIT margin was 15.6% impacted by inflationary pressures and planned R&D investments. This is equivalent to the 14.5% on a standalone basis. Looking ahead, we have several levers to expand margin through strategic pricing, enhancing volume and mix and increasing variable cost productivity as discussed at our Investor Day. Adjusted EPS for the full year was $4.63 and our standalone adjusted EPS result was $3.38. Free cash flow was $1.8 billion in 2022, and Helmut will discuss guidance in greater detail here later in the call. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the strong performance we delivered in 2022. We\u2019re encouraged by the easing supply chain pressures and the resilient end market demand we\u2019re seeing across our portfolio, and we remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable value creation in 20 23. I\u2019d also like to highlight an important announcement we recently made with the ointment of Dr. Taha Kass-Hout as our Chief Technology Officer. Taha is leading our science and technology organization as well as our efforts to drive growth through clinical research and the advancement of our digital and machine learning capabilities, specifically our Edison Digital Health Platform. He joins us with deep clinical, digital and machine learning experience. Taha was most recently Vice President of Machine Learning and Chief Medical Officer at Amazon. Taha also served as the FDA\u2019s first informatics leader and he\u2019s joining the team at a perfect time as we accelerate investments in digital products and software. As we invest in our business, we\u2019re continuing to make progress on enhancing our operating model to better serve customers through a simplified more decentralized model And we\u2019re reducing bureaucracy in the organization, optimizing our geographic footprint and implementing platforming initiatives across key product lines. And with that, let me hand the call over to Helmut to walk through our financials and business segment performance. Helmut? Helmut Zodl : Thanks, Pete. Let\u2019s take a closer look at our financial performance in the fourth quarter. Revenues of $4.9 billion increased 8% year-over-year and were up 13% on an organic basis. Reported product revenues increased 13% versus the prior year, led by Imaging, Patient Care Solutions and Ultrasound. Reported Services revenues declined 2%, mainly due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange, partly offset by growth in our cloud services business. We are pleased with product growth in the quarter that will lead to additional services revenue. Now, I\u2019d like to talk about the actions we are taking to increase margins through improving delivery, price and cost. As always, delivering for our customers is our number one priority. We\u2019ve improved our access to key components, measured by the number of red flag parts that indicate constraints and made good progress in the requalifying, redesigning and tool sourcing parts. In fact, we\u2019ve requalified 7,700 parts since COVID began and we are now seeing the lowest level of red flag parts since the first quarter of 2021. We\u2019ve also applied lean principles to improve our supply chain. A great example of how we apply lean across the organization was our CT\u2019s output initiative this past quarter. We align factory output with customer installations to drive better end-to-end planning. This resulted in an improved customer experience and early deliveries in the quarter. We have achieved a positive sales price index for the third consecutive quarters now. And this price accretion occurred across each of our four segments in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with our progress in pricing and have good visibility on price in our backlog. We are driving variable cost productivity for logistics and material cost reductions. We are also reducing our real estate footprint and optimizing our commercial organization. Turning to Imaging. We saw strong organic revenue growth, up 18% year-over-year, led by molecular imaging, CT, MR and surgery. Our customers remain focused on expansion of capacity and access to care. Looking ahead, we expect imaging demand will remain healthy supporting top line growth. Following strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, we expect growth will normalize as we move into the second half of the year. Segment EBIT margin declined 120 basis points year-over-year. We realized improving volume and price, but this was offset by headwinds from inflation, mix and planned investments. Our double-digit investment in imaging R&D this quarter reflects our commitment to innovation and commercial growth. During the quarter, NPI\u2019s driving growth included our Revolution Apex CT with a scalable detector as well as Ascend CT with improved imaging and workflow. Globally, we\u2019ve already seen success using deep learning from improved image quality in MR with AIR Recon DL. We are now very proud to be the first to extend those capabilities to Omni Legend PET/CT with precision deep learning available in select regions. Sequentially, EBIT margin increased 120 basis points, driven by improved volume and price. We expect margin expansion in 2023 to be driven by NPIs, commercial execution, supply chain productivity, platforming, and digital. Overall, we are investing to drive technology leadership and have the opportunity to increase market share with strategic NPIs digital and AI leadership and a focus on care pathways. In addition, we\u2019re making progress with platforming initiatives that provide a more consistent user experience and drive parts sensitization and cost reduction. Moving to Ultrasound. Customer demand continues to be strong in both hospital and other care settings. Organic revenues were up 7% year-over-year, driven by price, improvements in sourcing and fulfillment. Our customer-led innovation continues to drive healthy revenue growth with strong performance in radiology and primary care, women\u2019s health and cardiovascular, and our handheld business delivered strong growth in the quarter. We see continuous traction with our differentiated products, including our recently launched Voluson Expert 22 premium ultrasound system for women\u2019s health and the Vivid E95 ultrasound addition advanced cardiovascular ultrasound. Both innovations are powered by advanced artificial intelligence tools to help improve workflow, efficiency and productivity. Segment EBIT margin contracted 120 basis points year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, price improved. However, we experienced headwinds from inflation and planned investments. In line with our lean philosophy, we are shifting from stocking inventory to make to order. This initiative is streamlining cost and reducing lead times. We are enabling this through redesign of parts, dual sourcing and platforming. This is an initiative that we will be leveraging across the company, providing additional margin opportunity. Looking ahead, we are driving sustainable growth in ultrasound through continuous NPI innovation, commercial excellence and localization. The integration of BK Medical is also well on track. Let\u2019s move to Patient Care Solutions. PCS had a solid fourth quarter, following a year of supply chain challenges, which improved as we exited 2022. Organic revenue was up 10% year-over-year, driven by volume and price improvement. Higher volumes were driven by supply delivery and the launch of NPIs. Looking ahead, we expect fulfillment to improve as we ship our backlog. PCS margins increased 410 basis points compared to fourth quarter 2021, with improving price and volume as well as lower cost, partially offset by inflation. The cost favorability drove roughly half of the upside and was associated with one time items. Sequentially, PCS margins increased significantly due to improving volume and price. We remain focused on innovation and commercial growth investments with R&D investment up double digits in the fourth quarter. Key highlights from the quarter include continued momentum with patient monitoring, including Portrait Mobile and CARESCAPE Canvas in Europe. Moving to Pharmaceutical Diagnostics. Organic revenues were up 2% year-over-year impacted by fewer procedures in China due to COVID as well as normalization of U.S. customer inventory. Margins were impacted due to inflationary pressures on raw materials and lower volumes. The team is executing on the pricing strategy that is built around the value we deliver for our customers and patients. We continue to monitor the COVID situation closely in China and expect elective procedures to pick up when COVID infections decline. In the fourth quarter, we introduced a new GE HealthCare CT motion injector that will provide better product integration and an improved patient experience. Next, I\u2019ll walk through our cash performance for fourth quarter and full year 2022. During the quarter, we generated $987 million of free cash flow, up year-over-year with improvement in supply chain and collections. With our focus on prioritizing patients and customers, our free cash flow declined for the full year 2022. But as we enter 2023, we are well positioned to deliver on our backlog. This is a robust and consistent cash flow generating business with a disciplined capital allocation strategy. We are committed to a strong investment-grade rating and will employ a disciplined capital allocation framework. This will include paying down debt and evaluating accretive M&A that advances our precision care strategy. Our balance sheet is strong. As expected post spin, our day one cash balance was $1.8 billion. Day one leverage, excluding pension, was approximately 2.5 times, in line with our expectation. Let me now move to our 2023 financial outlook. For the full year 2023, we are reaffirming our guidance that was introduced on January 10, calling for year-over-year organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%. We expect stronger organic revenue growth in the first half of the year with more normalized growth in the second half. We continue to expect fully adjusted EBIT margin to be in the range of 15% to 15.5%, reflecting an expansion of 50 basis points to 100 basis points over the 2022 standalone adjusted EBIT margin of 14.5%. This includes the impact of approximately $200 million of standalone costs. Margin expansion in 2023 will be back-half weighted as transformation initiatives take hold. We expect 2023 adjusted EPS in the range of $3.60 to $3.75, reflecting a growth of 7% to 11%. This compares to 2022 standalone adjusted EPS of $3.38, and includes the impact of the standalone costs. We are assuming a tax and adjusted tax rate of 23% to 25%. Free cash flow conversion is expected to be 85% or more for the full year. Our cash flow outlook assumes that the legislation requiring R&D capitalization for tax purposes is repealed or deferred beyond 2023. The free cash flow impact of this legislation is approximately 10 points of free cash flow conversion for the year. Second half free cash flow will be substantially higher than the first half of the year, in line with typical cash seasonality due to increased inventory as well as interest and compensation and benefits payments in the first half. Now let me hand back to Pete. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Helmut. Before we go to questions, I\u2019d like to reiterate how we\u2019re executing against our long-term growth strategy. Our teams are well positioned to deliver on our 2023 commitments. We\u2019re investing in organic growth as demonstrated by the introduction of over 40 new products at the RSNA event in November. And with workflow solutions enhanced by AI to help healthcare professionals and health systems overcome the top operational challenges they face today, while also improving outcomes for patients. We\u2019re deepening customer engagement across care pathways, including oncology and cardiology, and we\u2019ve announced some exciting new products, collaborations and investments that are changing the way healthcare is delivered. On the M&A front, we recently announced the agreement to acquire IMACTIS, an innovator in CT Interventional guidance. This acquisition, although small, is our first as an independent company and is a great example of the type of transactions that we plan to pursue. They had innovative technology in fast-growing areas that enhances the breadth of capabilities we can deliver for customers. In Imaging, we\u2019re very proud to announce SIGNA Experience, an MR platform that was \u2013 comes with an integrated set of solutions, including workflow capabilities, an intuitive user interface and deep learning AI applications such as Air Recon DL, which has already reduced scan times for approximately 5.5 million patients globally and is increasing efficiency for clinicians. Globally, demand for minimally invasive surgical procedures continues to grow. In the U. S., for example, ambulatory surgical centers are performing more than half of all outpatient procedures. And to serve patients, our customers need efficient imaging capabilities. As a leader in surgery imaging, which is a high-growth and high-margin business for us, we see increasing opportunities for our OEC 3D C-arms to provide precise 2D and 3D images interoperably for many of clinical applications being done in ASCs, including spine, orthopedics and pulmonary work. During the fourth quarter, we also announced an $80 million investment in one of our facilities in Norway to increase capacity for our contrast active pharmaceutical ingredient. In our PCS business, we\u2019re excited about our Portrait Mobile patient monitoring solution currently available in Europe. This technology allows us to expand care into sub-acute therapy areas, giving providers the ability to monitor patients that aren\u2019t always monitor as thoroughly as they should be. In Ultrasound, we\u2019re excited about the customer demand for our Vivid Cardiac Ultrasound portfolio, which again is equipped with AI features that help improve consistency of assessing the heart muscles function and significantly reduce the time it takes to acquire those imaging measurements. And in digital, we continue to make progress with the development of our Edison Digital Health Platform to help solve customer challenges. We have several pilots underway at hospital systems in the U. S. and Europe and we expect that cloud-based or on-prem Edison Digital Health Platform will be a vendor agnostic platform aggregating data from multiple sources and enabling integrated care pathway management. Our goal is that customers will benefit from a wide range of AI applications developed by us and third parties to make better connected decisions, operate more efficiently or better detect trends and populations. These are just a few of the examples of products and partnerships we\u2019ve invested in to advance our capabilities in precision care. And so with that, we\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Carolynne Borders : Thank you, Peter. I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so that we can take as many questions as possible during the one hour that we have allotted for the call. Michelle, can you please open the line? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for your question. Our first question comes from Drew Ranieri with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Drew Ranieri : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Peter Arduini : Good morning, Drew. Drew Ranieri : Good morning. Good morning and congratulations to you and the GE HealthCare team on the spin-off and Pete welcome back to more earnings calls. Just maybe first to start on the macro environment. I think there\u2019s still some concerns that there will be a capital spending slowdown at some stage. Your results, I mean, you\u2019re pointing to ongoing demand across your portfolio, but maybe just help us kind of square what you\u2019re seeing from the demand side globally? Maybe what product categories are getting probably the most interest? And do you think there has been any risk of pull forward of capital sales just over the past year or anything? And I have a follow-up. Thanks. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Drew, for the question. Yes, I would just say if I go around the world and start maybe in Europe, there\u2019s still robust demand at this point. I think as we\u2019ve talked about in the past with \u2013 in different audiences, that from different sick funds and tenders to really drive incremental imaging capabilities post-COVID. And so we see that continuing here into the future. China has obviously been a topic in the news. And although COVID was challenging in Q4, there was quite a bit of investment that we saw going into imaging in particular and in an ultrasound. And we believe as the market there works through some of the challenges with COVID in Q1, but there\u2019s just a lot of pent-up demand. If you think about 2022 and even 2021 with some of the lockdowns, there\u2019s a lot of people that have a lot of procedures to be taken care of. And in the United States, we were pleased to see with different customers that have reported as well as customers that myself, Helmut and the team have been talking to regularly are seeing improving conditions. It doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re back to, say, 2019 levels. But it means that we\u2019re seeing improvements in labor costs. The demand or backlog, meaning the need for imaging procedures, both in our interventional diagnostic and ultrasound modalities is still at a record high. And so we look as we start the year that the demand is running strong. I think part of the piece that we all keep an eye on is CapEx prioritization in the United States. I think all indications are that people are being prudent and prioritizing for sure, but many of the technologies that we offer tend to be prioritized to the higher end of the list. And what customers tell us is, in many cases, that added productivity to get patients diagnosed faster, sooner, get them healthier and out of the system is one of the key attributes that we bring. So we\u2019re cautiously optimistic, but I\u2019d say with our large backlog that we have starting the year, we feel good about the horizon that we see here over the next couple of quarters. Drew Ranieri : Got it. Thank you. Maybe one other question just on the margin expansion, maybe more for Helmut. But can you maybe help us just bridge the 50 basis point to 100 basis point of improvement for the year. Maybe just talk about, is this all really gross margin-driven or on the leverage side? But just trying to get a better sense there and maybe how your 5% to 7% organic growth guidance really will drive that margin expansion and if there\u2019s any particular segments that are really going to be the primary beneficiaries? Thank you. Helmut Zodl : Yes. Thank you, Drew. I think so when we look at the overall margin expansion in the 50 basis points to 100 basis points, there is a number of drivers in there So clearly, volume is a driver, VCP, so we have a cost productivity, improvement in material cost, improvement in logistics cost, and also price is key drivers. So those are really, I would say, those key elements that are driving them with the positive improvement on the margin side. If you look at the headwinds against that, we\u2019re still seeing material costs elevated. So especially material cost that is sitting on our balance sheet, in our inventory currently. And we also continue to invest into the business, both for our growth, but also what we are putting innovation investment in R&D into the business. So these are really the offsetting element. So both of those elements together are really driving our 50 basis point to 100 basis point margin expansion and we\u2019re very focused on what is really in our control, which is price, VCP and obviously volume execution. That\u2019s really how we look at the margin expansion for 2023. If I give you a little bit more color, Drew, on the four segments, obviously, as you\u2019ve seen in the fourth quarter, the Imaging segment, very strong with its growth. We expect that growth, as we work through our backlog, continue especially for the first half. So there\u2019s going to be more growth on the imaging side. But also all our other three segments, Ultrasound, PCS and PDx, we expect to grow in that range as we have laid out the 5% to 7% as we go forward. So it\u2019s a very good balance as we go into the New Year. Operator : Our next question comes from Ed Ridley-Day with Redburn. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Good morning. Ed Ridley-Day: Good morning. Thank you very much, and I\u2019d add my congratulations on your successful spin and your results. And first question for me would be actually around your molecular imaging business, this continues to drive growth in the wider imaging business. Could you help us better quantify the benefits you see there, particularly what percent of your imaging business does this represent roughly? And also in pharmaceutical diagnostics, you have provided the market breakdown between contrast and molecular. But what percent of pharmaceutical diagnostics is radio pharmaceuticals? It\u2019s a great opportunity. So it\u2019d be great to have any color you can give on that? And just a quick follow-up on pricing. Could you give us an idea of the price \u2013 rough price increase you hope to push through for this year? Thank you. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Ed, for the questions, Yes, I\u2019ll start maybe a little bit with MI and frame it up, and then maybe, Helmut, you can comment a little bit on price. I would start first with saying, yes, I think one of the really interesting things that we\u2019re excited about strategically is we\u2019re the only company out there that actually makes the fuels for molecular imaging as well as has the devices that capture to create the images themselves. Why that\u2019s important is this rise of different technologies out there called theranostics, this combination of a therapy and a diagnostic together and how you tune the device to the agent whether it be in the neurosciences area such as Parkinson\u2019s or amyloid beta plaque imaging or other parts of the body. There\u2019s a lot of longer-term benefits we think will come that way. Our \u2013 in the agent business itself, MI agents are about a third of volume, about two-thirds is contrast imaging agents used in the X-ray equipment. But we believe that\u2019s going to be a growing area with again newer capabilities coming out of the pharma space that we play a critical role in helping do the diagnostics. On the device side itself, we\u2019ve got a great platform, a great team. We do some outstanding work here in the United States as well as in Israel on these devices, probably one of the deeper expertise capabilities on different technologies, whether they be BGO or LSO, different types of PET/CT detectors as well as the CZT expertise we have within our MI devices. And combined between PET and MI, we think that this is going to be continuing growth area. It\u2019s still at this point compared to MR and CT, a more moderate sized business. But again, with the rise of these new technologies and giving an example of an aging comes out that needs this type a follow-up to actually assess either amyloid beta plaque or other capabilities, we believe our MI technologies out in the industry will really play a key role in helping drive that diagnosis. And then down the road can even play a larger role in the therapy process either dose or delivery of agents. So, Helmut, you may want to comment a little bit on the pricing question. Helmut Zodl : Yes. Thanks, Pete. So Ed, on price, we\u2019re quite happy with the progress we\u2019ve been making on price throughout the year. So we started really tracking price on orders last year. So we have both a management system that looks at the orders, but also looks at how much price we have in sales. And in sales, since the second quarter, we have price in our sales or in revenue. It started at the low single-digit. It improved as it went through the third quarter. And we are now for some of our modalities in the mid single-digit level what we are seeing on price. So we were quite happy about how we performed, and we also have good visibility on price for this in our backlog. So we already know what is going to happen and ship here over the next quarters and how much price is in the backlog. Carolynne Borders : Michelle, we\u2019ll take our next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Congratulations on a nice finish here and thanks for taking my question. Peter Arduini : Thank you. Vijay Kumar : Maybe my first question here on the guidance assumptions here. Peter, can you talk about any trends and cancellation rates or cadence that we need to be aware of? When you look at the 5% or 7%, what is pricing? How much of that 5% or 7% do you have visibility given the backlog and the book-to-bill ratios here? Peter Arduini : Yes, Vijay. Look, good question. We have some actually quite good visibility at this point with carrying a little bit larger backlog than we normally do. One of the advantages of that is we actually have greater visibility out into the distance about what the deals look like, what the margin is on the deal, the timing thereof. And one of the things our operating teams in each of the segments have done a very nice job is actually speaking with customers and getting all the installed base products planned out as far as we can go, which is in many cases, a couple of quarters out, which is longer than we have historically done, but we did that purposely just based on some of the questions within the macro environment. And so that gave us more confidence obviously here about what customers want, when they want it and we\u2019ve got some pretty good visibility into that. Other businesses such as ultrasound that have more flow capabilities based on prospecting funnels and stuff, we have quite good visibility as well. So if we look at that backlog, we know what the cost \u2013 the input costs are going into that. We have \u2013 we know what the price is in the backlog. So again, for those deals, it\u2019s quite good. We clearly have orders coming into the system that will feed into that backlog. We know what our current pricing is. And we\u2019ve also either taken some price increases or had some that would cut in. And keep in mind, there\u2019s a couple of different ways to think about price looking at your configurations and really optimizing them is something that we started last year. And I think that\u2019s of high value. Our new NPIs, we really focus on getting the right value for the customer and pricing it right the first time, which typically then aligns to making sure that we have the right gross margins associated with it. And then classic price increases on many of our products. So again, the combination of those gives us a pretty good view into how we see the year at this point, but probably more so a better lens on the first half. Vijay Kumar : Understood. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe one follow-up for Helmut. Look at EPS guidance here, 7% to 11% between your organic top line assumptions and margin expansion, I think operating profit should be growing close to double digits here. Any \u2013 what are you assuming for FX and any below the line sensitivity here on interest expense or other items that we need to be aware of? Helmut Zodl : Yes. So Vijay, we have been obviously tightening up the range on the EPS guide. So the $3.60 to $3.75, we believe is right in the middle. When you look at the upper and lower end of the revenue and the margin expansion guide, so we wanted to tighten that range up. And to the assumption question, so there\u2019s about 2.5 basis points of negative impact from FX assumed in those numbers, very little below the line. So that\u2019s really how you should look at it. Peter Arduini : Yes. And I would just say, Vijay, one of the things is we\u2019ve got and we\u2019ve talked about improving supply chain. But again, improving isn\u2019t back to, say, the good old days. All of our input costs have some added cost to them. It\u2019s why we put a lot of focus on variable cost productivity. We\u2019re carrying some inventory from spot buys and things that was at higher rates. And we\u2019re going to see much of that continue into 2023, but we have good visibility to it. And I think as we see how the economy plays out and how that plays out relative to inflation, we\u2019ll have better insights about what we can do about it. But again, our first half visibility looks quite good at this point in time. And again, we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019re going to continue to see improvements throughout the year. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful perspective. Thank you, guys. Helmut Zodl : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Lawrence Biegelsen : Good morning, Peter Arduini : Good morning, Larry. Helmut Zodl : Good morning, Larry. Lawrence Biegelsen : Hi, Pete. Hi, Helmet. Thanks for taking the question. One on the top line, one on the margins. Pete, you talked about clearly Q4 results were very strong, 18% in imaging. You talked about the backlog here. Is there any way to quantify this? Is there \u2013 I mean, is this somewhat of a catch-up, if you will, and what are your expectations for that for 2023? Clearly, you\u2019re growing well in excess of historical market growth. And I had one follow-up. Peter Arduini : Yes. Larry, I think particular to imaging, we obviously as well as us and pretty much everyone in other industries with the installed type products had some pent-up demand. And I mean that\u2019s part of our backlog, right? And we were able to deliver a higher percentage of that. That typically is more in MR, CT, PET/CT, again some of the bigger installation-based products, but it\u2019s affected the whole portfolio at some level. And so, Helmut mentioned the words we focused on making sure that we leaned in on getting the parts that we needed at the right time. It had a little bit of an impact on our cash flow, but we had the components available to ship, which then resulted in the higher growth. And I think with that, we\u2019re going to see that into the first half. Now we would expect that that will start moderating and get back to more classical historic growth rates. But what\u2019s interesting is you speak with customers again back on the list of their top capital buys are, in many cases, diagnostic imaging equipment, MR ranks up their high. We\u2019ve mentioned the OEC C-arms in our remarks. Anybody that\u2019s doing any type of surgical imaging and outpatient center, that\u2019s the preferred device. So it\u2019s quite strong, but we are definitely running at a higher level. And our RPO or our backlog that we have is quite strong. And again, just to emphasize, we\u2019ve got good visibility on that into 20 23 and well into the year. Lawrence Biegelsen : Thank you. And Helmut, on \u2013 well, sales and margin cadence, appreciate the color. Maybe if you could help calibrate us a little bit more. How much lower do you expect second half organic growth? Is it going to be below the 5% to 7%? And then margins kind of how much lower in the first half, do you still expect to be down year year-over-year? Thanks for taking the question. Helmut Zodl : Larry, So maybe I\u2019ll reiterate how we look at the overall guidance for the full year and quarterly flows. So on revenue, we expect growth to be stronger in the first half, clearly and that is driven by the backlog and also how we have lined up really past and inventory in the first half accordingly. But the good news is going to be that we still expect sequential growth in the \u2013 into the second half. So typically, our Q3 and Q4 is higher than our Q1 and Q2. But growth rates, we expect to be slightly lower than what we are seeing in the first half accordingly. So that\u2019s the side on the revenue. On the margin side, you will see, I think, more of the margin expansion in the second half as we expect some of those productivity initiatives to taking hold, especially around VCP and cost improvements on the gross margin side. And the reason for that is really because we still have, as I think, Pete said that earlier, we still have elevated cost that is sitting in our inventory on our balance sheet. And as we flush that inventory through, we will have lower margins in the first half that then will improve into the second half. And we\u2019re already seeing this based on those red flag parts of how much parts we have, how much parts we have to purchase at spot buys. And so that\u2019s going to be the side on the margins and more of that in the second half. And maybe I\u2019ll comment on cash flow also just to be clear on that also. So a very large piece of the cash flow given our seasonality in our business we expect to happen in the second half, less of cash is going to be generated in the first half because of interest payments, because of some of the supplier payments that are bigger in the first half as well. So that\u2019s really how you should look at the quarterly flow for 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from Veronika Dubajova with Citi. Your line is open. Veronika Dubajova : Hi, good morning and thank you, guys, for taking my questions and congratulations on the successful spin as well. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Veronika. Veronika Dubajova : Maybe you guys can talk a little bit about the competitive environment that you\u2019re seeing, and I\u2019m thinking in particular in imaging and ultrasound. Curious if you\u2019re seeing any changes. We saw one of your peers this morning canceled some historical orders, which they felt were at a lower price. Is that creating opportunities? Or in general, are you seeing opportunities that are driven by the disruption that this one peer of yours has suffered? And maybe specifically if you can comment on China and how the local strategy is playing out for you guys? Then I have one follow-up after that, but I appreciate this is a long question, so I\u2019ll let you answer that first. Peter Arduini : Yes, Veronika, I would say, look, from an environment in the marketplace, I would say a little bit just because of some of the dynamics here that there\u2019s quite a bit of demand that\u2019s actually out in the marketplace when you look at these backlogs of imaging procedures. And so all of the different players, I think, at some level are having some positive benefits of this market. I mean, again, the prioritization of the CapEx just doesn\u2019t apply to GE HealthCare, right? It applies to everybody. And so we\u2019re expecting that there\u2019s a reasonable healthy amount of demand out there. And everyone at some level has had different experiences and challenges with their supply chain. So there is some similarities. At the same time, we think because of the investments that we\u2019ve made over the past few years, we have some products that are winning share more so about the capabilities they bring to patients and customers than a situation where maybe one or two of our competitors are in. And so I mentioned molecular imaging, where we\u2019ve got leadership positions. What we\u2019ve done in MR with our image quality as well as productivity, our CT surgery, what\u2019s come out with ultrasound, that\u2019s how we\u2019re winning the day and in many cases, taking share in different marketplaces. I would say we are really being balanced about what we go after to make sure that we get the right margins and capability around. So that\u2019s an important part of our overall strategy. I would say to your China question, look, there\u2019s always been lots of local competitors. In many of our modalities for 10 to 20 years, there\u2019s been 5x or 4x the amount of competition within China for China versus the rest of the world. And I think, as you know, we\u2019ve been competing there for many, many years, manufacturing for over 30. So we have a pretty good handle on it. And with some of the stimulus funds that were \u2013 the government put out really at the beginning of Q4, we\u2019ve been seeing some robust demand for imaging equipment, in particular, both ultrasound and the whole spectrum of the imaging portfolio. And again, I think we\u2019re going to see that continue into beginning of next year. And so we\u2019ve been able to be quite successful we believe in competing against, both multinational as well as local competitors. We see ourselves, in many cases, as local \u2013 as a local player in many of our modalities again because of how we actually design and make products in China for China. You have another question? Veronika Dubajova : Yeah, I did it, which was China specifically, if you can just remind us what proportion of your portfolio is certified as local now? And when might we hit 100%? Helmut Zodl : Yes. So, Veronika, we have a very large components of our portfolio is localized. And I would say it\u2019s not close to 100%, but not far off 100%, that\u2019s how I will answer the question for most of our modalities. And we continue to expand that on an ongoing basis because it\u2019s not only the localization of the manufacturing, but there\u2019s also the innovation in China. So having specific product that\u2019s really made for China, made in China, that\u2019s really how we look at it. So innovating for the China market then accordingly. So this is quite high percentages. The teams worked very hard. And we have a long \u2013 as Pete said earlier, we have a long history in China. It\u2019s an important market for us. Our brand is very well recognized, which we are proud of and we are continuing to innovate for customers in China. Peter Arduini : And I would just to put a finer point, Veronika, I mean, for what we have set as our operating plan for 2023, we have all of that localized and feel quite good about it. As Helmut said, as we bring new products out, one of the big question is, how much you\u2019re going to localize versus not. But for what we need to compete, we\u2019re in a very good position with localized components and that type of recognition that\u2019s needed in certain types of tenders or constructs to compete. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Hi, Anthony. Helmut Zodl : Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Petrone : Hi, Pete. Hi, Helmut. Congratulations on the spin and a great initial quarter out of the gate here. So congratulations to the team. Maybe a little bit on new product introductions, MPIs and that is certainly a contributor here. So in the plus 13% overall, I guess what percent of that actually came from new products.? And then when we think about the backlog, what is embedded in there for new products? What percentage of the backlog is going to flow through with newer systems that are recently introduced, let\u2019s say, over the last 12 to 18 months? And I\u2019ll have one quick follow-up on capital allocation. Peter Arduini : Yes, Anthony, I\u2019ll make some comments and Helmut feel free to jump in. I think again, in this business having new products that bring solutions that solve some of the challenges for customers, in many case, productivity, products that help deal with some of the labor challenges or expertise and then solving big issues for patients. We\u2019ve been quite fortunate with a lot of our launches recently again and some of the classic modalities, MR, CT, we mentioned about the PET system that has integrated AI on it. All of those have played a key role. I think in the fourth quarter, we were in the upper 20s, high 20s or so relative to vitality rate on new products that have been recently launched. My metric typically is if you\u2019re above 20% in that range, that\u2019s a very good vitality metric, then you were closer to 30% within new products that are out there. I think there\u2019s quite a bit of demand as we talked about for certain products in outpatient centers and there\u2019s still quite a bit of demand in updating, in some levels, an older fleet within the acute hospitals around the world. Helmut, do you want to add anything? Helmut Zodl : Yes, I would just add, I think as Pete said, so the innovation and the new products are happening really across the portfolio. I just would call out, it\u2019s happening both on the device and I talked about a couple of those innovation in my remarks, but it\u2019s also happening on the digital side. So a lot of AI and machine learning that happens on the device accordingly, which is really a different way of introducing an NPI. So there\u2019s a lot of times spend on that by the team, which really helps clinicians significantly both get more productive, but also help better patient outcomes. Peter Arduini : Yes. And the last part, Anthony, is I think from a service standpoint, as we sell these more highly sophisticated products into the installed base, 12 months out, the probability of capturing that for a service contract because of the sophistication of the product and really the limited amount of other folks that can provide the type of services needed for one of these advanced products will then become more reoccurring revenue growth down the road. And so that type of capture rate involved with leading products, it\u2019s an important part of our equation on growth. Anthony Petrone : Very helpful. And quickly on capital allocation, it\u2019s been dynamic out of the gate here. You did the tuck-in with IMACTIS. We also had the debt recapitalization with the spin. And of course, you\u2019re doing internal investments with contrast, expanded the plant last year. So maybe just high-level comments on capital allocation when we think of internal investment, the debt service out of the gate here post spin, tuck-in M&A and then return to free cash holders? Again congratulations. Thanks. Peter Arduini : Yes. Thanks. Helmut Zodl : Yes. Thanks, Anthony. So the way we look at our capital location, first and foremost, we are very happy with our strong investment-grade ratings we received last year. This is important for us access to capital, but it\u2019s also equally important for our customers. I mean, Pete just talked about long-term services contracts. People want a strong financial partner that know \u2013 they know that\u2019s going to be with them for many years, sometimes decades only. So this is first and foremost very important. Obviously, investing in the business is a key priority. We increased our R&A investment substantially in 2022, it was up more than $1 billion that we spend on R&D now. And going forward, we expect that to really grow with the revenue. But when you then look at the rest of the capital allocation, obviously, this is a strong cash-generating business. I\u2019m talking about 85% or more free cash flow conversion. And we will use and deploy that cash to continue to invest organically into the business, but also out of the free cash flow inorganic investment. IMACTIS was one example. Pete and I spent a lot of time with our M&A team to look at opportunities because I think it\u2019s important for us to see what is out there and make sure that we have a good transparency and visibility and then make decisions that are going to be very disciplined for such acquisitions if they fit into our portfolio and AI accretive both at the top line growth, but also from a profitability perspective. Operator : Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Your line is open. Ryan Zimmerman : Hey, thanks for taking the questions, and I echo everyone else\u2019s sentiments in the first quarter here. So just want to ask about two metrics that you\u2019re giving to The Street? And what is the book-to-bill ratio? I know there\u2019s been a lot of questions on it, but would appreciate some historical context in terms of how to think about that 1.07 ratio and how to think about it on a go forward basis? If you could give us any quantitative perspective from prior quarters on the book-to-bill ratio and just how to think about that? And similarly in that vein, I\u2019ll ask my follow-up is, is there\u2019s about $10 billion in remaining performance obligations, at least as of the filings. And so just if you can, Helmut, elaborate on the length of those obligations, how far those extend out? How those are realized over the coming quarters? And then how to think about that $10 billion on a go-forward basis? Is that kind of the par level to think about 4G healthcare as we think about going forward? And if you\u2019ll be giving out these kind of metrics going forward? Thank you. Helmut Zodl : Yes. So Ryan, I think to the RPO, we feel good about the Q4 in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07. And this really I think demonstrated that the markets are strong. The book-to-bill, the way how we define it is really, I think, a quite simple calculation across the whole portfolio. And you mustn\u2019t forget, we had quite a large services business in this as well where book-to-bill is 1. Also the PDx business for us as a book-to-bill of 1. So when we look across the portfolio, you will see book-to-bill is actually higher in our imaging products, where we have obviously from taking the order until shipment takes a longer time and we\u2019re quite comfortable with the backlog. Historically, that book-to-bill, I would say, has been running in similar ranges. It would have been up above the 110 level at certain quarters if we look at historically, but it\u2019s running at a very solid basis at this stage. As it relates to our RPO, the RPO, as you mentioned, is a big amount that we have disclosed and we\u2019re quite happy with that backlog. The RPO, the way it\u2019s defined, I want to be also maybe clear on, it\u2019s defined as backlog that is non-cancelable. So we also have backlog that is non \u2013 that is cancelable, where we see very, very little, very few cancelations from our customers because they\u2019re committed to the product, that\u2019s really how we look at that RPO. And we\u2019re exiting the year at a very strong position both on the RPO side as well as the total backlog. And just to be clear, the RPO, it is $14 billion. I don\u2019t know if they did better $10 billion number you quoted came from, but it is $14 billion at the end of 2022. Ryan Zimmerman : Thanks, Helmut. Thanks for taking the questions. Helmut Zodl : Thank you. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Ryan. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Jason Bednar : Hey, good morning, everybody. And again, I\u2019ll echo the congratulations here on the quarter and the guide and with the spin and everything. I do want to touch here on China and build on the discussions from prior questions. I think most acknowledge there\u2019s some level of pent-up demand in that market. I know you\u2019ve referenced it, Pete. It might be tough to call right now, but how do you see the China market unfolding here for GE HealthCare in 2023? And really, as we look throughout the year, if there\u2019s any cadence you\u2019d like us to think about? And then maybe if you could speak to what you\u2019ve embedded in the guide for China this year? Peter Arduini : Yes, Jason, I think \u2013 look, I think China, it\u2019s obviously tricky to fully estimate how things will play out. I mean, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic. But again, if you pull the lens back, you look at the market, you take a look at how, in many cases, procedures have been suppressed over the last 18 months at least potentially even 24 months. Things are clearly opening up. And yes, there\u2019s challenges within the hospitals now with COVID patients and such. But if we think of our own facilities that we\u2019ve been able to keep running through Q4 when COVID levels were up 60%, 70% in the environment, we were able to do that with learnings we had from how to run it in the first half of 2022. But we\u2019re now seeing a lot of those rates, particularly in the bigger cities, where a lot of the businesses transacted to drop off quite a bit. And so our estimates would be Q1, I think, is going to be a little bit choppy based on the type of products. If I think of flowable products like our PDx is tied to procedures, probably a lower level of a procedure volume in that quarter versus how we would see quarters two, three and four. But on equipment, we actually would expect that it\u2019s still going to be reasonably strong and it\u2019s driven by a different dynamic, which is the stimulus funds that are out there and requiring products to be taken on install. We also make some products that actually help assist with COVID patients whether it be monitoring events or other products in CT and stuff. So there\u2019s a bunch of different activities going on, but we would expect that China will continue to ramp throughout the year. And again, we can\u2019t predict all the different changes that may take out, but our take at this point in time is Q1 a little bit more tempered and then continue improvement throughout the year. Jason Bednar : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Pete. And then maybe just as a follow-up with respect to price and I\u2019ll come back to that topic here. Pete, you and the team do have a lot of confidence in price and tailwind supporting growth here going forward. I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about price increases on products and goods, but I guess how are you seeing pricing play out in the services side of your business? And are you anticipating similar pricing power there over time with your service contracts? Thank you. Peter Arduini : Yes. No, I think, look, I would just say on broader pricing, our job to get price really comes down to is to bring more value to the customer to help solve their problems. And the more we can create products that really solve a bigger issue, we can get our fair share of more pricing. And so having your organization, your teams aligned and thinking that way, having a gross margin focus as well, is something we\u2019ve just driven across the company and build into compensation plans, build into focus. So I think that\u2019s an important part. And it goes for both equipment and services. Obviously, with services, there\u2019s a different type of horizon, usually multi-year how you think about it. We\u2019re also investing in innovative new services, whether they be different types of remote capabilities, Again, when you think about the brake fix side of our business, these are highly valuable products that being down for half a day or a day can wipe out a lot of profits for the institution. So if you have capabilities to be able to keep the product up running, customers are able to pay more for that. The other aspect is there are other services with an S on the end and some of those are digital on how you run your operation or how you can run capabilities. And in that \u2013 those cases, we can obviously ask for even higher prices as well as better margins than what we would have from normal brake fix. But we\u2019ve been successful at taking selective increases. And again, with more of these advanced products, the related service contracts for them will also have a tail of better pricing down the road as well. Operator : Our next question and our last question comes from Yuan Zhi with B. Riley. Your line is open. Yuan Zhi : Good morning. This is Yuan, and thank you for taking our questions. I have a couple of them related to the pharmaceutical diagnostic business. First, on PDx. PDx was listed as a revenue priority. Can you elaborate between molecular imaging and contrast media, which segment would drive the growth you guys have mentioned? And I have a follow-up question. Thank you. Peter Arduini : Yes. No, look, good question. PDx is definitely a growth driver. And again, I just want to reframe as we talked about all of our businesses, all of them have growth opportunities and all of them have margin expansion. But PDx has more of a growth priority upfront. And I think it\u2019s both sides of the PDx Health, both our contrast business as well as our MI business, we\u2019re expecting to see accelerated growth. As an example, in contrast with the growth of the imaging procedures that we\u2019re talking about, anything that needs a contrasted-based capability like a vascular study with our leadership position in contrast ionized imaging, we\u2019re going to continue to see that increase. So I think that\u2019s one. On the molecular imaging side, again, with the rise of new agents that are out there, whether they be in prostate or different neuroscience-based agents, we would be expecting to see that pick up. I would say the contrast agent is probably more of a temporal or closer 2023 impact. And the MI is probably has more of an impact later in 2023 into 2024, just to kind of give you a profile of how we think about the growth there. Yuan Zhi : Got it. Thank you for the helpful color there. The follow-up question is our understanding is that the product such as Optison for ultrasound and with Vizamyl for Alzheimer\u2019s disease PET scan maintaining a healthy gross margin. Can you maybe help us understand what prevents competitors to lower price and gain a larger market share, while at the same time, what stops other companies entering the space and making generic compounds of this product? Thank you. Peter Arduini : Yes. No, it\u2019s a good question. I would say, first of all, they do have healthy margins. One of the interesting things about our pharmaceutical diagnostic business, both in contrast and MI that you had referenced, is the proprietary nature of how we make it, I would say, the capital hurdles of the infrastructure and then the sophistication of the infrastructure. And just to give an example, if there is a typical molecule in the pharmaceutical world that comes in a 10 ml vial and a generic comes out, people can have five ready, they can be shelf stable, they can be shipped around the world, stored for two years. Many of our agents are made that have half-lives, they\u2019re radioactive, right, that only can live for maybe a couple of days. And so you literally have to have production capabilities cyclotron setup, a distribution network on how to deliver radioactive capabilities to pharmacies, we have that infrastructure and that know-how. And so even though some of these will have patents on them, the actual barriers to entry are more around the infrastructure and capability than they are based on particular IP and the normal pharmaceutical space. Operator : That concludes the question-and-answer session. Please proceed with any closing remarks. Peter Arduini : Thank you. So, look, in closing, let me just reiterate how excited I\u2019m about our path forward as we invest in our business. The emphasis on innovative products in high-growth areas, many we talked about today, we delivered strong organic revenue growth and sequential margin improvement in the fourth quarter and we expect to capitalize on robust demand in 2023, as we execute on our revenue drivers across each of our segments. And we\u2019re also optimizing the business through lean. We\u2019ve given quite a few examples today, and this gives us confidence in our ability to reach our margin targets and drive meaningful shareholder value over the long-term. Our full team is united and excited about our purpose-driven approach for the benefit of customers and most importantly patients that we serve. So thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing you at one of our upcoming conferences that will attend. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

My name is Olivia, and I'll be your conference coordinator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Carolynne Borders, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please proceed. Carolynne Borders : Thanks, Olivia. Welcome to GE HealthCare's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I'm joined by our President and CEO, Peter Arduini; and Vice President and CFO, Helmut Zodl. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's press release and in the presentation slides available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Peter. Peter Arduini : Thank you, Carolynne, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased by the solid performance we delivered in our first quarter as an independent company. The momentum we demonstrated last year has continued, and I'd like to thank our teams across the world for their continued dedication to executing on our precision care strategy. We delivered strong 12% year-over-year organic revenue growth with contributions coming from all of our segments, driven by increased fulfillment, improved pricing and commercial execution. We expanded adjusted EBIT margin year-over-year through price and lean initiatives focused on cost and operational effectiveness and we're on track to achieve our margin expansion goals for the year. We continue to monitor customer prioritization of capital purchases of our products, and we are cautiously optimistic given resilient end market demand. Supply chain challenges are improving, giving us line of sight throughout the remainder of the year. We continue to invest organically to deliver long-term growth, demonstrated by the 13% year-over-year increase in R&D in the first quarter, in line with top line growth. In addition, we acquired Caption Health and IMACTIS, which provide us access to new technologies, markets and clinical capabilities. I also want to highlight today's declaration by our Board of a $0.03 dividend for the first quarter of 2023. This reflects our confidence in the durability of our cash generation, a disciplined capital allocation strategy and our commitment to returning value to shareholders. Overall, the momentum we see in our business gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year 2023 guidance. With that, let me hand the call over to Helmut to walk through our financials and business segment performance. Helmut Zodl : Thanks, Pete. Turning to our financial performance. For the first quarter of 2023, revenues of $4.7 billion increased 8% year-over-year and grew double digits at 12% organically. This was primarily driven by strong product growth across all segments. Adjusted EBIT margin improved year-over-year to 14.1%, growing 150 basis points on a stand-alone basis versus last year. Margin was up to the higher volume, which was partially offset by the mix of products versus services. In addition, we were able to mostly offset inflation and play investments through our pricing and productivity actions. But we are pleased with our margin performance during the quarter. There is room for more improvement. We have lean action plans in place to continue to expand margins further through volume, price and productivity initiatives across the company. Adjusted EPS was $0.85, up 35% on a stand-alone basis, driven by our strong revenue growth as well as margin expansion efforts. Free cash flow of $325 million was down $46 million, as expected based on the spin-related items, which I will discuss shortly. Total company book-to-bill, which, as a reminder, is a calculation of total orders divided by total revenue was 1.01x. This was driven by strong revenue growth across all our segments, led by recurring PDx sales. We continue to see customers invest in solutions that drive better clinical insights and productivity across the U.S., China and Europe. Moving to revenue performance. We grew 12% organically year-over-year. Foreign exchange was a headwind of 4% to revenue growth during the quarter. On a reported basis, product revenue increased 12% year-over-year driven by PDx sales with strong demand from increased procedures. Services revenue grew 1% versus the first quarter of 2022. Our strong product growth will translate to services growth as we go forward. From a regional perspective, we are pleased to see all regions growing with China up double digits. We are pleased with our margin performance this quarter. As we continue to focus on improvements in delivery, price and productivity. We delivered a positive sales price for 4 consecutive quarters with growth in all segments. These efforts combined with our productivity initiatives enabled us to generate year-over-year and sequential gross margin expansion. We also continue to see supply constraint easing with spot price and logistics costs down sequentially and year-over-year. The actions we've taken to broaden our supply base coupled with the continuous application of lean principles has helped us to requalify almost 8,000 parts since COVID began. This has led to the lowest number of red flag parts since the first quarter of 2021, enabling us to deliver for patients and customers, which is our top priority. As we look at our platforming initiatives, we have made good progress in CT with increased standardization of components across the portfolio. We've identified opportunities for simplification in sourcing, purchasing and manufacturing. We are in the process of implementing similar changes in MR. Following our spin-off from GE, we are on track with planned exit of TSAs, with approximately 40 exited to date. We remain focused on reducing G&A costs for example, with real estate expense and IT costs. Moving forward, we see opportunities to expand margins through additional actions for instance, in logistics with greater shift from air to ocean and greater platform standardization. Before I get into the segment commentary, let me remind you that in 2023, approximately $200 million of recurring stand-alone costs will be impacting our segment EBIT margin rates. These costs are generally allocated based on the revenue and did not exist in 2022. Turning to imaging. We saw strong organic revenue growth, up 12% year-over-year. This was led by MR as well as molecular imaging and CT, driven by supply chain fulfillment improvement and growth in revenue from MPIs. We expect continued high growth throughout the first half of 2023 that will normalize throughout the rest of the year. Imaging demand is expected to remain healthy, supporting top line growth. Segment EBIT margin of 7.7% declined 120 basis points year-over-year as planned investments and mix outweighed higher volume. Productivity and pricing initiatives more than offset inflation. We expect sequential margin rate improvement as we move throughout the year. Through lean efforts in imaging, we initiated a rolling 13-week schedule to maximize factory output and customer satisfaction. This will improve fulfillment as well as working capital.  Overall, we expect steady growth in demand in 2023 with a number of drivers, including a continuous backlog of procedures, expanding indications for high-end diagnostic exams and new therapies requiring precision imaging. Moving to ultrasound. We saw strong organic revenue growth, up 10% year-over-year, led by cardiovascular, general imaging and women's health products. This was driven by MPIs and improving supply chain fulfillment with few electronic component shortages. While we expect growth to normalize as we move throughout the rest of the year, we continue to see strong customer demand in both hospital and other care settings. Segment EBIT margin of 24.1%, was up 50 basis points year-over-year. We realized benefits from productivity and price initiatives, along with volume growth. This enabled us to offset headwinds from inflation and planned investments, including the Caption Health acquisition. We expect the EBIT margin rate will remain generally in line with the prior year. We continue to focus on patients and customer-centric innovation, especially digital and artificial intelligence solutions. Moving to Patient Care Solutions. Revenue was up 11% organically, driven by volume and price. This resulted from greater backlog fulfillment as supply challenges eased, particularly for electronic components. We benefited from dual site production for highly constrained products. Revenue was also driven by the launch of key MPIs contributing to increased volume, such as CARESCAPE Canvas and the B100 series of acute care monitors. PCS backlog remained strong, which will contribute to revenue growth into the future. We expect quarterly revenue dollars to remain relatively consistent throughout 2023. PCS margins of 14% increased 490 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year, driven by productivity, price and volumes. These are partially offset by inflation as well as planned investments. Productivity in the first quarter was driven by favorable logistics and lower spot price. We expect EBIT margin rate to normalize throughout 2023. Moving to Pharmaceutical Diagnostics. We saw strong organic revenue growth, up 19% year-over-year, driven by price, increased procedures and the stabilization of supply. We expect continued revenue growth for the year based on favorable comparisons in the second quarter and the fourth quarter. Segment EBIT margin of 27.8% declined 70 basis points year-over-year, mainly driven by raw material inflation and planned investments. This was partially offset by price and volume and productivity which also drove full 80 basis points of sequential improvement. We continue to expect this segment to deliver strong EBIT margin performance. As we look ahead, we are investing in capacity to meet future customer demand. Next, I'll walk through our cash performance. During the quarter, we generated $325 million of free cash flow. This was down $46 million year-over-year, impacted by $85 million of incremental post-retirement benefit payments and $42 million of interest payments, which were not in our 2022 actuals. Without these new cost-related items, year-over-year free cash flow would have been positive for the quarter. Working capital improved year-over-year primarily driven by collections and inventory efficiency. We have leveraged lean to implement a daily inventory management system. In the first quarter, we achieved solid results from controlling and better predicting inventory inputs and outputs with shorter lead times and improved revenue conversion cycle. As a result, we saw faster inventory turns and over 100 million of improvement in intra-quarter inventory. Strong cash flow generation will allow us to pay down debt and invest organically and inorganically in our business. We are pleased to initiate a dividend with opportunity for growth over time. Our dividend philosophy is driven by prudent capital planning as well as a strong revenue and earnings growth potential and a robust free cash flow profile. Our balance sheet remains strong with significant financial flexibility. Let's move now to our outlook. For the full year of 2023, we are reaffirming our guidance. We continue to expect year-over-year organic revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%, with strong organic growth in the first half of the year versus the second half. In line with seasonality, we expect revenue dollars to grow first half to second half. Our current view is a foreign exchange headwind of less than 1 percentage point for the year. We continue to expect full year adjusted EBIT margin to be in the range of 15% to 15.5%. This would represent an expansion of 50 to 100 basis points over the 2022 stand-alone adjusted EBIT margin of 14.5%. We also expect to see an increase in adjusted EBIT margin rate from the first half of the year to the second half, driven by higher volume and productivity benefits. We expect R&D investment to grow at the higher end of the 2023 organic revenue growth range. Our guidance for adjusted effective tax rate remains in the range of 23% to 25%. Our full year 2023 adjusted EPS is unchanged in the range of $3.60 to $3.75, representing 7% to 11% growth. This compares to 2022 stand-alone adjusted EPS of $3.38. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be 85% or more for the full year. Our cash flow outlook assumes that the legislation requiring R&D capitalization for tax purposes is repealed or deferred beyond 2023. The free cash flow impact of this legislation would represent up to 10 points of free cash flow conversion for the year. For 2023, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $350 million to $400 million. I'd like to add that our second and fourth quarter cash flow will be impacted by interest payments as roughly 75% of our interest expense related to our long-term debt is paid out in these quarters. Given this interest payment timing, we expect lower cash generation in the second quarter versus the first quarter. Cash flow will be substantially higher in the second half of the year relative to the first half due to typical cash seasonality and annual timing of supplier and compensation payments. In closing, it has been a strong start to the year, and we are confident in reaffirming our guidance. Now I'll hand back to Pete. Peter Arduini : Thank you, Helmut. Before turning to Q&A, I want to provide an update on some exciting focus areas in our business. In Imaging, we're energized about the developmental advancements we're making with photon counting CT technology for improved spectral and spatial resolution, reduce radiation and enhanced contrast to noise ratio of tissue at a molecular level. This step change in technology will help provide clinicians with more capabilities to significantly increase imaging performance across a variety of care pathways. We believe we're on the right path towards the industry's second generation of photon counting technology with a deep silicon approach for even better resolution and clinical results. This technology will expand our imaging capability into high pitch helical and gated cardiac imaging, which are just a few of our important milestones in development. During the quarter, we also announced our acquisition of Caption Health, which expands access to Artificial Intelligence powered ultrasound imaging guidance for novice users. We're utilizing AI to provide real-time expert guidance to the user, and this helps us obtain diagnostic images providing advancements for patient care outside the typical hospital-only setting. And while we'll be starting with cardiac care pathway, we expect to extend this to other specialties in the future through continued R&D investment. In our Patient Care Solutions business, we announced the FDA 510(k) clearance of our CARESCAPE Canvas monitoring platform. This interoperable solution can flex based on individual patients' needs for precise care. And the platform also offers continuous upgrade capability, so hospitals can adopt new technologies at their own pace for efficient fleet management across the different care pathways they serve. This series of MPIs represent initial steps towards realizing mission-critical infrastructure transformation that leverages the Edison platform and enables artificial intelligence in patient monitoring. In neurology, we've been watching the emergence of disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's and the positive impact on patients. With the success of these advancements, we anticipate the need for more imaging. GE Healthcare is one of the only companies that has a full suite of products and solutions to support the entire Alzheimer's patient journey. And this includes our Vizamyl diagnostic agent and PET scanners, which can be used to confirm diagnosis and the MRI systems to monitor throughout the therapy. I'm also pleased with the initial progress that we've made since forming our science and technology operations led by Dr. Taha Kass-Hout, our Chief Technology Officer. Specifically, we're driving cloud adoption to deliver on our digital innovation strategy and also building out these capabilities into our device portfolio. Last week, we met with many customers and collaborators at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, the HIMSS Meeting, where we featured our growing portfolio of digital and AI innovations to help increase operational efficiencies, improve diagnostic confidence and support early interventions. In closing, I want to reiterate that we're encouraged by the strong results we delivered in the first quarter. Our margin improvement initiatives are taking hold, and we see ongoing opportunities to drive productivity and growth. Our backlog remains solid, and we're confident that we are investing in the right areas to drive long-term innovation. And with reaffirmation  of our guidance to the year, we're demonstrating our commitment to delivering for customers and shareholders. Lastly, our team continues to be passionate about making a difference for patients. We recently held our first Patient Care Week. Our employees had the opportunity to experience the real impact of our products, solutions and services and how they're driving and delivering better outcomes for patients and also access to care. This is a great example of the cultural transformation taking place at GE Healthcare. With that, we'd like to open it up for questions. Carolynne Borders : Olivia, we're ready to open for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : Sorry, I was on mute there. Congrats guys. And just want to start off. So the book-to-bill ratio came in at 1.01. I think orders were down, if I'm not mistaken, from last year by about 3% -- 2.7%. But just correct me if I'm wrong on that, Helmut, because it's just a summation number in the GE deck from last year? And then how do you think about kind of the seasonality of this dynamic, the book-to-build ratio as we progress through the year? Helmut Zodl : Yes. Ryan, I think, let me probably remind you the calculation of the book-to-bill is orders over revenue. So our first quarter book-to-bill at 1.01 is really reflecting our 12% revenue growth. So with improved fulfillment and especially our PDx sales. In PDx, we have a 1 :1 ratio of book-to-bill. The backlog, maybe if I'll cover that a little bit, grew sequentially. So our RPO is now at around $14.5 billion, which is up 1%, and we saw positive orders growth. We don't disclose order growth in details, but we saw positive order growth in the quarter. And our total backlog is close to $19 billion in this. Again, this was a very strong quarter in delivering top line revenue growth. At the same time, our RPO is slightly up on a year-to-year basis. Peter Arduini : And Ryan, I would just add, I think we had a strong quarter in Q1 of last year. The numbers came in this year right on track. We'll expect that to continue to grow. And again, just to emphasize Helmut's point, when you have a high performance on something like a flowable product like PDx and stuff, it fundamentally is kind of a net neutral one-to-one transfer through. But the team delivered what we needed to deliver, and we're on track here to what we believe we need for orders to grow throughout the year. Ryan Zimmerman : Got it. Very helpful. And I just want to ask about -- we've heard some comments about the diagnostic pipeline improving and then driving the procedural environment. We heard that from some of the med tech peers last week. And Pete, I'd love to get your perspective on the environment, particularly from a diagnostics perspective, I mean, you're seeing it probably through some of the imaging volume and just kind of how you think about the balance of the year from a diagnostic screening perspective? Peter Arduini : Yes, Ryan, it's a really interesting question. And obviously, we have a certain lens into it. But I think if you step back when I'm out on the road talking to customers, and I've been with quite a few recently, you're just seeing that almost any type of therapy, whether it be in the musculoskeletal, whether it be in the cardiac, oncology, everything is heavily gated by some level of diagnostic to choose a better decision whether it be an implant, some type of interventional device to precisely fit that patient. And so particularly in the imaging world, we're still seeing significant demand and procedures for customers, meaning that their backlogs are still quite long. And again, we don't think this is necessarily a blip. We think that with the rise of many new therapies whether it be TAVR or whether it be pharmaceuticals that require more follow-up and measurement, just the need for what we do to make sure that you're getting the optimization and outcome, but also managing cost is there. So we see it quite strong. And it's interesting, it's not just a U.S. phenomena. I mean, we're seeing this in most markets around the world. Helmut, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. Helmut Zodl : Yes, maybe I'll add a little bit. I think we're spending a lot of time with our customers, especially devices and digital solutions, we were just at HIMSS in the last week, a lot of discussions, how our devices can really help drive productivity to reduce that, I would say, challenge on the backlog and the shortages on personnel that some of our customers are having. That's really a key focus of our customer, which drives demand. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Anthony Petrone : Congrats on a strong first quarter here. Maybe, Pete, a couple for you here. I'll just pick off where Ryan left off here. Maybe rounding out just the discussions with hospital customers, what are you hearing on the capital spending front? We've heard some, in certain cases, still very bullish outlook, certainly for imaging, but on certain high-ticket items, there seems to be a little bit of friction. So maybe just your thoughts on the CapEx environment. And then I'll have a couple of follow-ups. Peter Arduini : Yes, Anthony. I would say not a lot has changed since we reported even in our fourth quarter from that standpoint. I think we're encouraged by kind of the steady recovery of the global procedures, which is really the underpinning of this, which says, if you have a lot of patients that need procedures, they need planning, they need evaluation done and you don't have enough equipment that drives demand. And again, it's not always new sockets. It may be software and upgrades to your fleet to bring new capabilities. So we see that happening. And if I just go around the world, China has strong growth. Obviously, COVID for a couple of years, things opened up, a lot of demand there. Our intercontinental markets, Southeast Asia and LatAm were seeing actually similar strong growth as specific countries and areas, Indonesia, different areas in Southeast Asia and Latin America, investing. Western Europe is quite stable. I think the continuation of some of the sick funds investments that took place coming out of COVID really just starting to deliver on that equipment. And the U.S. is, look, since COVID, people have been prioritizing capital. I mean, so that's no new news for us. But again, what we keep an eye on is what they're deciding to put it against. And I think with nursing costs starting to flatten out, you're seeing a little bit more of, I would say, positivity on that spend. That being said, we think we're going to be in a capital prioritization kind of focus throughout this year, which is why we're cautiously optimistic. Anthony Petrone : That's helpful. And then follow-up, one for you, Pete, and a quick one for Helmut on margin. Intrigued by the comments on Alzheimer's disease and maybe just a little bit of a description is, is that something that is driving demand now? And when you look out, how long do you think that tailwind to the business can be with just new drug therapies coming to market? And then quickly for Helmut on margin, when we think about the $200 million of stand-alone costs, just sort of the outlook on when you can perhaps see leverage on those new costs that were brought into the business. Peter Arduini : Yes, Anthony. Look, on the Alzheimer's point, no, I don't think we're really seeing any impact on demand to date. But when you look at what can come, what the pipeline looks like we think there's going to be larger demand. I'll even pull the lens back a little bit further. It ties into part of Ryan's question as well. I think, look, bigger picture, imaging capabilities and diagnostics used to kind of manage how devices are executed, but probably even more importantly, expensive pharmaceutical injectable therapeutics, how they're utilized, how they're titrated, how they may be dosed and the follow-ups on potential complications really seems to be a potential kind of norm in the future. So if you think about this case, neurosciences, if you think about in oncology with theranostics, if you think in cardiology with different follow-ups for structured heart or heart failure, we see that happening. And so we'll see how that plays out. But like in our case, where we make the actual tracer, Vizamyl for amyloid-beta plaque detection and quantification, really the only one that has that type of product that actually even colors that and separates it out. It hasn't been reimbursed. And so we believe once the therapies get reimbursement like in other therapy areas, the companion diagnostics also do, that's what will enable some of the growth. And so I'm optimistic, like most things, it will take a little bit of time. But over the next few years, I think there's going to be some interesting growth opportunities associated with that match up. Helmut, do you want to take the margin question? Helmut Zodl : Yes. So Anthony, I think around this $200 million of stand-alone costs, in 2023, we expect an estimated $200 million of those recurring incremental expenses. Those are primarily for support functions, so it's IT, treasury, IR and so forth. And these costs, they are not in our segment margins. They were not in our segment margins in 2022. We're allocating them in 2023 based on the revenue very generally. So I want to be sure that, that is well understood. And to your question, when we will see leverage against those one, to me, this is really dependent on how quickly we are exiting our TSAs. You saw me speak, we exited 40 TSAs in the first in the quarter. Here, we have more TSAs to exit that will take us into 2024. So I expect we'll see leverage against this $200 million of incremental recurring spin costs as we go into 2025 and '26, as we have fully exited on the TSA side and can really build our own infrastructure. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Jason Bednar : Congrats on a very nice start to the year. Maybe I'll start with organic growth. Just as we peel apart the components of the 1Q organic growth, are you able to quantify how much of that 12% may have come from pure price? It looks like you're calling out pricing tailwinds in each of the 4 segments. I'm just curious if we should be thinking in the area of 1% to 2%, 2% to 3%, et cetera, when we think at the corporate level? And then is that a sustainable figure as we look to future quarters? Or would you point us to maybe upward or downward bias in the pricing? Peter Arduini : Yes, Jason, it's Pete. I'll comment and see if Helmut wants to add anything to it. I think so it's a really great result. All 4 of our segments delivering quite nicely for us. And so from an overall growth standpoint, we clearly saw volume as the key driver here and our ability to kind of move on our backlog as well as some sell and install business as well that was taking place in our -- and particularly our ultrasound business and then the flow with that's taking place in PDx and the Injectable business. I'd say we're in the 2% to 3% range relative to price coming through, and the vast majority of the rest of it is in pure volume and uplift. Helmut Zodl : Yes. Maybe I'll add a little bit of comment on that as well, Jason. What Pete said, this is our fourth quarter in a row now that we are seeing positive sales price. And as Pete said, 2% to 3% accretion we expect in 2023. And in the outer years, that might flatten out a little bit to 1% to 2%. But what's really most important is the value we are providing our customers in -- with those products. And we are not only focused on price, but also really focused on the gross margin expansion because as we see new MPIs, we're looking very carefully what's the price accretion but also what happens in around margin accretion with those products. And lots of initiatives in place around BCP and platforming that will help and support that. Jason Bednar : All right. Very helpful. And I wanted to ask a follow-up just actually on Portrait Mobile. I think it was introduced almost a year ago. It's still pending 510(k), but you were showing it at HIMSS here recently. Can you discuss where you're at with the FDA in securing the approval? And then what early feedback can you share on Portrait Mobile for the markets in which it's available? Peter Arduini : Yes, Jason. So we're in with the agency. We would expect here in the first half of this year to be able to move through unless there's other follow-up questions and stuff. We're actually on the market in -- outside the United States, primarily EU. And if you think of the focus on Portrait Mobile, it really takes us into new territory. We haven't really been award-based monitoring company. And so that's really our first entree into the area. We've already had some really good feedback from different customers on enabling continuous monitoring the award. I think one of the bets that we're making is coming out of COVID, there tended to be more continuous O2, CO2, respiratory monitoring. And with the shortage of staff and stuff being able to instead of episodically, but constantly manage a patient, there's a big opportunity to manage your labor better by directly sending a message directly to a caregiver to check on that patient as opposed to just spot checking. So it's often running. We'll talk more about it here in coming quarters, but we feel quite good about that as well. And then that's complemented with this introduction that we just received prove on, which is the CARESCAPE Canvas. And the CARESCAPE is a platform that actually has more ubiquitous use that can be used in acute care but also step down. And what customers have told us is the challenge they have is you have to buy a different box from everybody for the different areas. And CARESCAPE is one of those first platforms that enables you based on the acuity of the patient to add on more parameters. But it's also designed for a future where you can actually gather the data on the patient and be able to apply artificial intelligence against it to actually predict when that patient is going to have issues. And so that's kind of our vision of why we're so excited about monitoring is this potential in the future to be able to track constant patient -- constantly the patient as well as predict when there might be an issue. So both of those are 2 new platforms for us the first in many, many years, and we would expect that to be 2 of the horses in the monitoring group here that we'll be growing our business on. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Edward Ridley-Day with Redburn. Edward Ridley-Day: Congratulations on the strong quarter. Firstly, on Imaging, great start to the year. If you could perhaps help us with the phasing on the margin. I appreciate a lot of investment, some of which you've spoken to today, given the opportunity. But if there's more color you can give us on the phasing of the Imaging margins for the year and where we should end up, that would be helpful? And I also had a follow-up question on Patient Care. Obviously, a very positive start to the year. You've mentioned some of them, but where were the particular strength in the product lines driving that growth? And also, if you can, can you give us an idea of how much of the growth in the first quarter was sort of backlog pull through? Peter Arduini : So Helmut, you want to start maybe with a comment on Imaging and then we'll jump on... Helmut Zodl : So I'll start with Imaging margins. So obviously, we are very focused on expanding the EBIT margins in the high teens in the medium term for Imaging. And if you look at in the first quarter, our margins were at 7.0% or 8% for imaging both were slightly lower than what we saw in the fourth quarter, but there was a clear reason because we were shipping a higher and a component of hardware versus services in the quarter. But as we expect the services pull-through, we expect those margins to improve. And what we also still were impacted in the quarter was, I would say, the cost for inflation. So what we have seen of inventory that was sitting on the balance sheet for Imaging specifically, both bringing down that margin. And the last comment I want to make in this is also that our Imaging margins as well as the other segments were impacted by the segment recurring spin costs. So those $200 million, I just talked a little bit earlier, were roughly 100 basis points, which is impacting basically each of the segments. But we have confidence that the Imaging margins, as we go throughout the year, will improve accordingly as inflation is getting less and less. Peter Arduini : Yes. I mean in the other aspect, as you could imagine, many of the Imaging products are much more sophisticated components, a lot more chips and stuff. And so some of those are burdened with, I'd say, higher cost items that we bought last year to make sure we could deliver through for customers. And as that inventory moves through, which we think will, as we move into the second half of the year, we'll see some margin lift from better productivities just from our sourcing standpoint. To your question on PCS, yes, we were quite happy with the performance overall. It was reasonably a wide scale kind of success in the quarter. I mean, our Monitoring business was double digits. Our MIC business, which is into the neonatal area, was quite well and also our Anesthesia business. And I would highlight Anesthesia because actually, at the end of -- in last year, we actually received PMA for title control, which is actually kind of a management of kind of parameters of oxygen and capturing of the agents in a much more effective way, and we are able to -- be able to capture more growth because of that upgradability, but also some more value. So it's a good start to the year for our PCS business. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : I don't think there's been a question on farm diagnostics yet. That was extremely strong. Pete, help us understand how much that benefited from the comps year-over-year from the contract shortage. But even when I look at that business on a sequential basis, it was up a lot. So how -- what happened there? What went well? And how to think about it from here? And I had a follow-up. Peter Arduini : Yes, Larry, the real impact from a comp standpoint will be more in Q2. There really wasn't a negative effect last year. There was a little noise in it just relative to COVID coming out. But this is really about procedures growth and the need to do contrast-based imaging. If you think about particularly in CT in the vascular world, any type of intervention you're going to do intervascular, you're going to evaluate. You need to have a contrast agent, whether it'd be the brain throughout the body. And so it's showing that robustness there. We also have taken some, I would say, appropriate price increases to deal with escalating costs of things such as iodine. And so the combination in there is that procedures growth, which is driving our volume, but then also the pricing that we've taken place in PDx. And so we would expect that, that business is going to continue to put up strong numbers, both top and bottom the rest of the year. Helmut, would you add anything? Helmut Zodl : Yes. Maybe I'll just add, because you may actually remember, Larry, in second quarter, where we had supply challenges in our factory in Shanghai. So there will be a higher growth in the second quarter. And then in the fourth quarter, we also had last year a small impact from inventory in the U.S. So there is also going to be higher growth during that quarter. So -- but overall, as Peter said, we're very happy, I think, with that business, I suppose the volume growth and also price is a strong contributor for the growth and margins, as you've seen, are quite strong and will continue to improve here. Larry Biegelsen : And Pete, obviously, we've seen immediate speculation on M&A involving GE Healthcare. And I know you won't comment on that specific asset. But can you comment on your thoughts on M&A in terms of deal size, areas of interest and financial criteria? Peter Arduini : Yes, Larry. Look, I mean we always are, as I've always mentioned, looking at M&A, I think it's a really important part of our DNA as a company, both to be really attentive to what's happening in our ecosystem and understanding where many of those deals will go. It's something that I started here, we do a weekly rhythm of looking at that whole atmosphere. And if you think about IMACTIS and Caption are probably emblematic really what we look at. So again, to emphasize, with IMACTIS, it brought interventional biopsy capabilities into CT. We didn't have the best offering. This is going to give us a leadership offering to really fill out the capabilities to grow our business. I talked about capturing bringing artificial intelligence into point of care ultrasound to start, to make it more usable into populations of non-sonographers, which we think is a huge opportunity. And so we look for technologies, both channel enablement as well as capabilities to enhance our overall strategy. And for the most part, they're typically tied into -- deep into our plans that we have already laid out. They help enhance, grow some of our businesses. And we have programs going on in all of our businesses, in Imaging, in Ultrasound, PCS as well as PDx. And I'd say one of the encouraging things are is there's a lot of interest out there, and we'll be disciplined in our approaches about how we look at them, but I think it's an important part of our growth strategy over the next 3 to 5 years. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Veronika Dubajova with Citi. Veronika Dubajova : If I can just revert back to one of the themes that's come up and Pete, I just was hoping you could maybe talk a little bit in terms of the order dynamics that you're seeing, each of the 4 businesses are seeing the strongest order growth and maybe the type of products that you're seeing those most tractions for as you look at across that hospital CapEx landscape? Is it a premium? Is it low end? And kind of how you're thinking about that? And then maybe just to circle back to China and whether that stimulus program that you had talked about in prior quarters has now come to an end? And is that something that would have helped Q1? Or do you think it continues into Q2? And any comments you have on the competitive dynamics in China, in particular, in Imaging would be helpful as well. Peter Arduini : Veronika, it was a little hard to hear, but I think the first question was around orders growth, different modalities, what's growing. And the second part was about China and some of the dynamics. Veronika Dubajova : That's correct, yes. Peter Arduini : Okay. So look, I think from an order standpoint and business growth, we're actually seeing nice growth and planning on it throughout the year. As you know, there are certain quarters in certain cyclical plays that, that promote others more or less. But I think from a standpoint of a lot of our bigger traditional diagnostic Imaging equipment, whether it would be MR, our molecular imaging portfolio between PET/CT, PET/MR, our new med cameras, we're seeing actually strong demand as well as CT and those tend to be the 3 big items. I would say within our interventional world, particularly our surgery business with C-arms, with the growth of ambulatory surgical centers, those are strong growers. And then our Ultrasound business across the board has multiple opportunities. Our handheld business, in particular, women's health. And we would expect throughout the year, we had a strong cardiovascular quarter last quarter. We would expect that with the new launch of the Vivid product last year, the new Voluson product last year, all of those have 2 to 3 years until peak year sales that we'll continue to see that. And I think you heard me mention around PCS, we actually, with fulfillment, we also have more sell and install opportunities as well. And I think the new monitoring platforms are going to drive growth and also the new anesthesia platform. So we see some pretty broad capabilities relative to our overall product. And then again, I'll just pull in PDx. But obviously, that's driven as a flow product tied to procedures. So we're seeing pretty broad strength across the board. Helmut Zodl : And Veronika, I can cover the China question here. So we really saw strong growth in China was up double digit in the first quarter. And we expect that demand to continue. We see good momentum going to the second quarter. And really, I think China is really back, so the manufacturing sites are all operating, COVID, it has basically disappeared. So we're quite happy with the overall performance of our teams delivering for customers and patients. And then the stimulus, the market will remain strong, whether there is a stimulus, and I belief still out there, and we feel quite optimistic about the rest of the year for our China market. Peter Arduini : Yes. And we've -- to your competitive question, I think dynamics, as we've been competing in China for many, many years, I don't think anything has fundamentally changed from that standpoint. We've really, as a multinational, led the pace of making sure that we have local content to be able to compete in tenders, making sure that we have local content to be able to have the cost positions to compete, and we believe we're in good shape to be able to do that. But as Helmut said, the bigger point here is after 2 years of COVID lockdowns, just like in the rest of the world, we would expect that there's some pent-up demand for procedures maybe latent disease, things of that nature that are going to drive the need for our products. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Congratulations on the Q1 print. Maybe my first one is here on the guidance here. Looks like Q1 off to a very strong start, perhaps coming in slightly above expectations, but the 5% to 7% was reiterated on the top line. Can you just talk about why the guidance perhaps the low end wasn't tweaked up? And clearly, that 12% in Q1, we've seen the backlog being worked through, component supplies getting better. How much of that back orders has been flushed out of the system? And how much is remaining? Perhaps some comment on how we should think about this guidance in back orders would be helpful. Peter Arduini : Yes. Vijay, look, I think a good question. So first, it starts off, we're super happy and excited about our first quarter results. I think if -- how we expected it to play out, it really landed where we had hoped. And so that's a great result. I would say the big part here is what this does with a strong first quarter as it helps really derisk the back half of the year. We had quite a few questions talking about the ramp-up and how we thought about that profile. But that really helps derisk the backside of the year. I think we're going to have better insights into kind of the macro discussions, where capital isn't items. As I've mentioned, we're cautiously optimistic right now. But with our first quarter as a stand-alone company, to get a few more months under our belt, and then we'll reevaluate it here as we finish second quarter and take a new look at how that is. But at this point in time, again, we're cautiously optimistic that we're on track. And again, I think of it as, in many cases, kind of reducing that type of ramp that we already had within our initial plan. Helmut Zodl : And Vijay, to your question around the backlog, obviously, delivering for patients and customers is really our top priority. So reducing the backlog is key. And in the quarter, we have an RPO of around $14.5 billion. It was very slightly up on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So despite the strong shipments and revenue delivery of 12%, the backlog actually was up sequentially. And as I've commented before, we have on top of the RPO, we also have other backlog that is cancelable, where we have -- we see never really any major cancellations. So the total backlog is around $19 billion exiting the first quarter, which we are quite happy with, because this is going to take us well into '23. Some of these orders also go into '24. So we're quite happy where the backlog is at this stage. Peter Arduini : Yes, at this point, I mean we're well positioned to obviously deliver upon our commitments. And again, if the year shapes up better, meaning that the macro environment improves and we get some better insights into how that plays out, particularly in markets like the United States, I think we're in very good shape to do better. But at this point in time, it's kind of prudent first quarter as a public company to kind of stay where we're at, and we're quite happy with the results. Vijay Kumar : Absolutely. That makes sense. And then one follow-up on the margins here. Clearly, Q1 coming in, I thought Q1 margin performance was quite pleasing despite the spot buys. Can you comment on what the pricing versus inflation spot buy dynamics was in Q1? And when you think about that EPS guidance for the year, what has been assumed for FX for the year and the margin range of 50 to 100 basis points, perhaps should we be thinking about the higher end of the range? Helmut Zodl : Yes, I can cover that your question here. So price and productivity was more than offsetting what we saw as inflation and our investment. So we were quite happy what we saw on price. Pete was commenting a little bit earlier, we typically see 2%, 3% in price, and we expect that it will lead to be delivered in 2023. So that was quite positive. In terms of currency, we saw a 4 percentage points impact on currency in the first quarter. For the full year, we're looking now at less than 1 percentage points of impact on currency to the top line. So it clearly has gotten slightly better. But as Peter said earlier, this is quite early in the year. This is our first quarter out here, and we're committed to the 50 basis points to 100 basis points of margin expansion for the full year. Peter Arduini : And I think, Vijay, we've talked about it and consistently is we expect our margin rate to be higher in the second half, given seasonality, but also productivity initiatives. And -- so we've got good progress on variable cost productivity, everything from logistics to other cost reductions. The thing we don't know is how that will play out with other cost of goods labor increases and items that are out there playing out. We think we've got very good plans to be able to deliver what we committed. If those were to improve, obviously, that would be a benefit that would come through in the P&L. But as Helmut said, it's still early in the year and we're on track to what we committed to. Operator : And our last question coming from the line of Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Patrick Wood : I've got 2 quick ones, which hopefully should be pretty easy. I guess the first is on counting. When you're thinking about that, the initial clinical data from some of your peers has been, I would argue, very strong versus base CT systems. So how do you view this technology? Do you view this as like marketing expansive and that you can get a good incremental price kicker on the back of these systems? Or do you view it as really a way to sort of increase barriers to entry and, I guess, consolidate share even more tightly amongst the top 2 providers relative to the broader pool? How are you thinking about that opportunity? And are you thinking about it? Is this -- are we talking commercialization within a year or 2 years? Or is it a longer time frame on that for you? Peter Arduini : Yes. Look, good question. I would say the first answer is how we're thinking about is what it's going to do to help with diagnosis, patients and how it can change the game. I think we all think that photon counting has the potential to be a game changer. And the point being is it brings some of the capabilities of MR tissue characteristics and things of that nature that today, you don't get on a CT scanner. So I think at a high level, part of this is taking a look at and saying, the technology we're delivering on has the possibility to have many more, I'd say, energy separation levels, which actually can give you much more insights into what's actually happening at a molecular level, more so than the first-generation products, which are based on [ CAD Tong ] state for the most part. So that's part of it. I think, look, what we think is, over time, all scanners most likely will move to that direction. Is that 5 years, 10 years, I think that will be the adoption question. And a lot of that is about the cost curve. And our approach with deep silicone is based on the fact that we can actually ride a cost curve, we believe, more effectively than a rare element approach. And so that's how we think about that it will expand greatly. Obviously, as these products first come out over the next few years, they tend to be more elite, higher-priced products at select institutions, but we're thinking ahead about how we can bring this to more of the broader masses. So that's kind of it. We're very excited about it. I think it's a very interesting opportunity. If you think back to this whole point about characterization of diagnostics for drugs and things, photon counting will play a key role, we believe, in the future of that as well. Patrick Wood : And then time frame on commercialization, any indication of that for us? Peter Arduini : Yes. We haven't communicated yet specifically what we're thinking about. We'll talk about that in upcoming meetings. Patrick Wood : Sure. Totally understand. And then last one for me, I guess, more around the kind of Q1 and the recent trends you've seen. You've said earlier on the call, but any sense of how the demand is looking split by sort of new sockets versus replacement? Are you seeing a lot of new sockets come online? Or is it more of a replacement market in the current environment? Peter Arduini : Yes, it's a great question. And I would say it's a pretty good mix between the two. Certain geographies have different characteristics. As you could imagine, in an inland growing China market, it's heavy on new sockets. In Europe, believe it or not, we're trying to see a little bit more new than old because there's more outpatients opening up centers. In the United States, it's probably a combination of 60-40 installed base or fleet renewals with new growth. And the new growth typically is tied to probably more of an outpatient imaging or tied to an ambulatory surgical center type environment. Operator : And that concludes the question-and-answer session. Speakers, please proceed with any closing remarks. Peter Arduini : Thank you. So look, in closing, we're very pleased with the strong start to the year, and we see significant opportunities ahead of us as we continue to innovate and solve some of these big challenges that we've talked about that our customers face in delivering high-quality care in and outside the hospital in a very cost-effective way. And we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Thank you for joining our call today, and I'm sure we'll see many of you at some upcoming conferences. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Olivia and I\u2019ll be your conference coordinator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Carolynne Borders, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please proceed. Carolynne Borders : Thanks, Olivia. Welcome to GE HealthCare\u2019s second quarter 2023 earnings call. I\u2019m joined by our President and CEO, Peter Arduini; and our Vice President and CFO, Jay Saccaro. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the presentation slides available on our website. During this call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Peter. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Carolynne. First, let me welcome Jay who\u2019s joining us for his first earnings call with GE HealthCare. Since he arrived last month, he\u2019s hit the ground running to immerse himself in our business and has been meeting with our global teams. You\u2019ll hear more from Jay shortly. Now let\u2019s look at our results for the second quarter. We delivered strong performance with 9% year-over-year organic revenue growth. This was driven by strong demand for NPIs and the continued value that we bring to our customers. We were also pleased to see global demand improve sequentially, delivering 6% orders growth in the second quarter, up from 3% in the first quarter. We\u2019re encouraged by health care providers\u2019 continued investment globally in capacity to improve patient care and productivity. Volume remains strong for surgical procedures, which drives demand for imaging, services and surgical equipment. In the U.S., customers are investing in products to improve productivity and enhance overall competitiveness. In the rest of the world, we\u2019re seeing solid demand in hospitals and in buying behaviors associated with increased procedures as well as the need for more productivity to address labor constraints. We\u2019ve made good progress on our operating priorities, including increased discipline utilizing lean as a management capability and rigor in areas such as variable cost productivity. This resulted in a 14.8% adjusted EBIT margin, which was an improvement of 70 basis points from Q1. Adjusted EBIT margins were down slightly year-over-year on a standalone basis as we continue to invest in the business, with R&D spending up 16% year-over-year in the second quarter. Some areas where we\u2019ve invested include photon counting, next-gen MR and artificial intelligence optimized interventional cardiology. We\u2019re also further developing machine learning capabilities across all modalities to build interoperable ecosystems of devices and applications. We expect our investments to deliver value for our customers while laying the groundwork for the advancement of precision care. Turning to capital allocation. We\u2019re focused on pursuing a balanced strategy with the goal of creating value for shareholders. This includes investing organically, acting on the right inorganic opportunities, deleveraging over the near-term and initiating a dividend. With markets improving globally and strong execution in the first half of 2023, we have confidence in our ability to deliver on the full year. As a result, we\u2019re raising our full year guidance range for organic revenue growth by 1 percentage point and $0.10 in adjusted EPS at the midpoint. Jay will now take you through our financials. Jay? James Saccaro : Thanks, Pete. Let me start by saying that I\u2019m thrilled to be here at GE HealthCare at such an exciting time for the company. In particular, I\u2019ve been really impressed with our team and the collaborative culture across the globe. I\u2019m looking forward to being part of this collaboration and helping to drive our innovation and growth goals, which will ultimately deliver value to our customers and shareholders. Turning to our financial performance. For the second quarter of 2023, revenues of $4.8 billion increased 7% year-over-year and grew 9% organically. This was driven by strong product growth. As Pete mentioned, organic orders were up 6% year-over-year. We\u2019ve decided to include this metric going forward as we believe it provides important information regarding demand and our future growth. Book-to-bill improved to 1.04 times versus 1.01 times in the first quarter of 2023. Our total backlog continues to be healthy at $18.4 billion. On a standalone basis, second quarter adjusted EBIT margin improved 70 basis points sequentially, with progress on price, delivery and productivity. However, it was down 10 basis points year-over-year due to inflation and R&D and commercial investments. Adjusted EBIT margin of 14.8% decreased 120 basis points year-over-year as price, productivity and volume benefits were offset by inflation and planned investments. Note that this decline was primarily driven by standalone costs that we did not have in 2022. It was also impacted by a challenging comparator versus the second quarter of 2022, when we delivered an adjusted EBIT margin of 16%. The result last year included mix benefits with increased sales in higher-margin services versus products, given supply constraints. Adjusted EPS was $0.92, up 12% versus prior year on a standalone basis, driven by our strong top line growth in the quarter, but down 20% year-over-year due to interest expense. Free cash flow was down year-over-year due to incremental interest and pension payments associated with our spin, which I\u2019ll discuss in greater detail shortly. Moving to revenue performance. We grew 9% organically year-over-year. FX was a headwind of 2% to revenue growth. On a reported basis, product revenues increased 11% year-over-year, driven by strong procedural demand. Service revenue grew 1%, which was impacted by foreign exchange. We continue to expect our product growth to translate to service growth in coming quarters as service contracts do lag new product sales. All regions posted strong sales growth, including in China, where revenue growth was in the double digits. And we expect continued momentum in the third quarter as China continues to prioritize improved health care access. Let\u2019s move to margin performance for the quarter. While EBIT margin was down slightly year-over-year on a standalone basis as we invest in future innovation, we remain focused on driving margin expansion through operational initiatives and with progress on our separation. During the second quarter, volume increased in all segments and regions. We had positive sales price for the quarter with growth in all segments. We also benefited from AI-powered new product introductions at higher margins. We\u2019ve made progress on our lean productivity initiatives, with logistics being the main outperformer as a result of improving rates and shifting delivery from air to sea. We also saw a decrease in spot buys. Enhancing our productivity efforts gives us visibility into future cost savings. In addition, we\u2019re making real progress reducing our SKU count to simplify our portfolio and focus on higher-margin products. On the separation side, we\u2019re very much on track with planned exits of TSAs, with approximately 100 exited to date. For instance, we continue to rationalize our IT services and applications to a fit-for-purpose model and we\u2019re progressing towards outsourcing certain activities previously performed in-house. Across the organization, we\u2019re focused on optimizing G&A by reducing our real estate footprint, our IT costs and other functional expenses. That being said, we expect the benefit of many of these changes in 2024 and beyond. As a public company, we\u2019re incurring approximately $200 million of recurring standalone costs annually that are now impacting our segment EBIT margin rates. These costs are generally allocated based on revenue and equate to roughly 100 basis points of margin headwind for each segment. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in the first half of 2023 and we have line of sight to expand margins going forward through our focused actions. Now let\u2019s discuss our segments. Turning first to Imaging. We saw strong revenue growth, up 9% year-over-year, driven by molecular imaging CT and MR. We saw supply chain fulfillment improvements, stable demand in the past few quarters, revenues from new products and also pricing initiatives positively impact results. Overall, imaging demand is healthy, supporting top line growth. Segment EBIT margin declined 190 basis points year-over-year. We made progress versus last year on productivity, volume and price, though it was more than offset by inflation from prior year purchases and planned investments. Importantly, margins improved 290 basis points on a sequential basis. Turning to Ultrasound. We generated organic revenue growth of 3% year-over-year following several quarters of strong revenue growth, reflecting significantly high backlog and fulfillment. Revenue growth in the second quarter was driven by cardiovascular and women\u2019s health. This included new product launches with AI capabilities aimed at driving improved efficiency and patient outcomes. Segment EBIT margin of 22.8% was down 380 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to planned investments. Productivity and price more than offset inflation. Ultrasound margin performance reflects our investment ramp in new product introductions such as advanced probe technology, products with more digital capabilities and ultrasound-guided surgical navigation. We also have inorganic investment with Caption Health, an artificial intelligence health care leader that creates clinical applications to aid in early disease detection using ultrasound. We\u2019ve added resources in our commercial organization for increased visibility and capture rate. We continue to focus on our market leadership position, expanding visibility globally and increasing China localization. We\u2019re excited about the growth opportunities in this business as we innovate and deliver differentiating technologies to the market. Moving to Patient Care Solutions. Organic revenue was up 9% year-over-year, driven by price and volume. We were able to fulfill more backlog with an improved supply chain. Revenue was also driven by new product launches and our backlog remains robust. PCS margins decreased by 50 basis points compared to the second quarter last year, driven by inflation and planned investments, which offset price, productivity and volume growth. We\u2019re investing in a digital future across PCS. And in particular, we\u2019re excited about the monitoring new products launching in the next few quarters, which we expect will contribute to volume growth. Moving to pharmaceutical diagnostics, we see continued recovery of global elective procedures, which supported strong organic revenue growth this quarter. Top line revenue was up 20% year-over-year, driven by price and the recovery of volume following the China COVID-related plant shutdown in the second quarter of last year. Recall that in the third quarter of last year, customers were purchasing more contrast media to secure supply. And in the fourth quarter of last year, COVID restrictions were lifted in China. Segment EBIT margin of nearly 27% improved 200 basis points year-over-year, driven by pricing actions, productivity and volume. In addition, there were one-time costs in the year ago quarter due to plant shutdown. This was partially offset by raw material inflation and planned investments. Next, I\u2019ll walk through our cash flow performance. The second quarter was impacted by spin-related items, including net standalone interest payments of $193 million and $83 million of incremental post-retirement benefit payments, which were not in our 2022 actuals. Excluding these post spin-related items, free cash flow would have been positive for the second quarter and an increase year-over-year. As a result, we expect 2Q will be our lowest cash flow quarter of the year. Working capital improved year-over-year, driven by better inventory management. As we\u2019ve previously noted, we expect substantially higher free cash flow in the second half of the year relative to the first half due to seasonality and higher volume as well as the timing of certain supplier and compensation payments that occur earlier in the year. Let\u2019s now turn to our outlook. As Pete said, we\u2019re raising our full year 2023 guidance for organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS. We now expect organic revenue growth for 2023 in the range of 6% to 8%, an increase from the prior range of 5% to 7%. Our current view is foreign exchange headwinds of less than 1 percentage point for the year. We expect revenue growth in the second half to be in line with our medium-term growth target of mid-single digits. We continue to expect full year adjusted EBIT margin to be in the range of 15% to 15.5%. This represents an expansion of 50 to 100 basis points over a 2022 standalone adjusted EBIT margin. We remain focused on driving margin expansion while continuing to innovate and invest in the business to drive long-term growth. We expect to see an increase in adjusted EBIT margin in the second half of the year relative to the first half. As we experience higher volume, we drive productivity benefits and also with the contribution from new product introductions. In line with seasonality, we expect the fourth quarter adjusted EBIT margin to be the highest of the year while 3Q will be similar to 2Q. We are also raising our full year 2023 adjusted EPS outlook to a range of $3.70 to $3.85, representing 9% to 14% growth versus 2022 standalone adjusted EPS of $3.38. This compares to our previous range of $3.60 to $3.75. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be 85% or more for the full year, with stronger free cash flow generation in the second half. Our cash flow outlook assumes that legislation requiring R&D capitalization for tax purposes is repealed or deferred beyond 2023. The free cash flow impact of this legislation would represent up to 10 percentage points of free cash flow conversion for the year. Now I\u2019ll hand the call back to Pete. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Jay. Before turning to Q&A, I want to touch on a few exciting areas that GE HealthCare is focused on to address patient and customer needs. In Imaging this quarter, we announced two deep learning artificial intelligence technologies, Precision DL and Sonic DL. Precision DL is available on our Omni Legend PET/CT and enables faster scan times and smaller lesion detectability. Sonic DL leverages capabilities from our AIR Recon DL MR platform and acquires high-quality MR images up to 12 times faster than conventional methods. By enabling imaging with a single heartbeat, it reduces the need for repetitive patient breath holds making MRI more accessible for cardiac patients. In Ultrasound, we introduced the world\u2019s first and most compact mini 3D transesophageal echocardiogram probe, designed for pediatric cardiology. It\u2019s 57% smaller than an adult probe and it provides access to real-time 3D imaging for children who could not tolerate an adult size probe. This innovative probe technology is an example of our investment and leadership position in ultrasound. We continue to invest in commercial capabilities and expand further into adjacent and new markets such as point-of-care and handheld ultrasound. In PCS, we\u2019re investing in monitoring solutions for critical care and acute patients. The introduction of CARESCAPE Canvas gives us a platform to build on for years to come and with Portrait Mobile being the newest addition on the platform. Portrait Mobile enables care teams to monitor the unmonitored by shifting the paradigm from periodic spot checks to continuous monitoring, freeing the patient from the bed while continuously monitoring for signs of patient decline. These are our first major introductions in monitoring in recent years and create an opportunity for installed base upgrades as well as new growth. In PDx, we announced the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, now recommend the use of FES PET imaging agent for estrogen receptor positive disease for patients. Cerianna is the first and only U.S. FDA-approved imaging agent to help clinicians assess reoccurring or metastatic breast cancer. The benefit of Cerianna is that it provides a whole-body view of estrogen receptor positive lesions in one exam. We\u2019re encouraged that the addition of Cerianna to the NCCN guidelines will increase this adoption. Turning to recent news about advancements in Alzheimer\u2019s disease therapies. Many of you heard about the FDA\u2019s recent approval of lecanemab and all other promising models \u2013 molecules in the pipeline that have the potential to provide millions of patients high-quality quality of life, if diagnosed and treated early. Before now, the only option was to fundamentally treat the symptoms. As these new therapies become more widely available, there\u2019s a need for precise and noninvasive imaging and digital solutions, which we\u2019re well positioned to deliver on. Let me walk you through the opportunities for GE HealthCare. Our technology, including MR and PET scanners and our amyloid imaging agent, Vizamyl, combined with digital solutions, enables us to be a disease state solution provider for our customers. As you can see on the page, these breakthrough therapies will create new market opportunities for us in upfront diagnosis, safety monitoring and follow-up. This approach that we often refer to as D3, which is about smart devices and drugs, a disease state-focused and digital solutions and is a good example of how we think about care pathways and our evolving role to provide precision care. While it\u2019s still early in the Alzheimer\u2019s therapy journey, we remain very optimistic about the benefit for patients and the growth opportunities this will generate for GE HealthCare, as a partner to providers. In summary, we\u2019ve had many accomplishments since our launch as an independent company and they have set us up for long-term sustainable growth. I\u2019d like to thank our 50,000-plus team members across the globe for their dedication and contributions on our initial phase of growth. I\u2019m pleased with the results we\u2019ve delivered in the first half, with strong visibility into our second half, supporting our updated outlook for the full year. We\u2019re seeing continued solid market demand for our products and services. We\u2019re allocating our R&D spend into high-growth areas to drive long-term innovation, while also driving margin improvement actions. And our healthy backlog provides good line of sight through \u201823 and into \u201824. And with that, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Carolynne Borders : Thank you, Peter. I\u2019d like to ask participants, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Olivia, can you please open the line? Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Anthony Petrone with Mizuho. Your line is open. Anthony Petrone : Great. Thank you and congratulations on a solid 2Q performance here and a positive outlook on the second half. Maybe, Jay, I\u2019ll start with you, one for you on margins and then I\u2019ll hop over to Pete on the comments on Alzheimer\u2019s disease. First, Jay, welcome to GE. Look forward to working with you. Maybe to recap on the TSA roll-off and when \u2013 how many TSAs are left? And when do you expect to see leverage gains against those TSAs rolling off at the operating margin level? And I\u2019ll have a follow-up for Pete on Alzheimer\u2019s disease. James Saccaro : Great. Thank you, Anthony. Appreciate it. So far, from a TSA standpoint, things are very much on track. We have quite a few to exit. In fact, we probably have over 400 TSAs to exit over the next several years, with the vast majority of those exits taking place 18 to 24 months following the spin. But so far, we\u2019ve exited 100 and it really is setting the stage for our successful transition to a standalone public entity. Importantly, about 1/3 of the exits that we\u2019ve had thus far are related to IT, another \u2013 about half of them are related to facilities. So I would say that there\u2019s really good progress on setting ourselves up. And then once we have that in place, we can really start to optimize the long-term footprint, the long-term operations of our company. What I mean by that and in the prepared remarks, I made a statement about our IT area. IT is an area where we have tremendous optimization opportunities. I just spent a few days with the IT team walking through many of those opportunities, things like moving to the cloud many of the servers that are currently hosted, things like rationalizing the application service providers, all of those will give us a multiyear tailwind in terms of optimization of cost. But the first step is getting to standalone. And so, so far, so good on the TSAs. This is going to be a \u2013 this will impact 2024, \u201825 and \u201826, more than it does \u201823 but it\u2019s crucial at this stage that we operate effectively as a standalone. Anthony Petrone : Thank you very much and, again, welcome to the team. And then maybe, Pete, just pivoting to the comments on Alzheimer\u2019s disease. You referenced Leqembi, recently secured an FDA approval here and more recently than that, we\u2019ve seen CMS actually propose local MACs to cover beta PET scans for beta amyloid plaque. That\u2019s a proposal that was put out there about a week ago. So when we take a higher-level look at this demand cycle, is there anything you can sort of book end us on the early views on a TAM opportunity when we consider that there\u2019s MR involved here, there\u2019s also PET/CT several \u2013 at several phases along the patient journey here. So maybe just your early thoughts on when this demand cycle begins and how large it can be for GE? Thanks again. Peter Arduini : Hey, Anthony, thanks for the question. I mean, let me just start out with \u2013 I mean, we\u2019re just living in a really fantastic window of time here, where between different therapies are coming up that are going to change patients\u2019 lives. And I think it\u2019s such a tremendous win for patients, these new drugs are coming out. Look, to bring this forward, as you know, governments, in our case, CMS with reimbursement, pharma and a company like GE HealthCare working with providers really what it\u2019s all about. And I think that\u2019s one of the interesting changes here, not only in this disease area but in other areas where we play a significant role in bringing forth these capabilities. I think 30%, 40% improvement, some early indications that earlier patients, better improvement gives us pretty strong confidence that these are going to be impactful. Think of us as the company that facilitates, so to speak, kind of the management of the disease. If you think about the last chart that I pulled up in the deck on 14, where we play a screening and assessment role with MR or our PET products, we play a major role in diagnosis with PET and are also radiopharmaceutical imaging tracer, Vizamyl and then actually treatment and monitoring. And in treatment, as you probably know, after each of the injections having an MRI to make sure that there aren\u2019t any baseline side effects. And then we think longer-term monitoring to see what is the baseline of the amyloid beta reduction at that point. And that all encompassed with some digital solutions that can make reregistration, that can make integration, make the tool sets much easier outside of an academic setting, so that this can work for providers. And so our opportunity is to work with big IDNs as well to help them think through the problem statement that\u2019s in front of them, of how do you provide this across rural care, concentrated city care, fleet management, and we think we can help make that happen. On the size of the opportunity, I think it\u2019s a little too early to say. I think it\u2019s not a huge opportunity in \u201823. But if you look over \u201824, \u201825, \u201826, depending on the uptake of the drug, which is going to be heavily tied to a companion diagnostic reimbursement, therapy diagnostic and the follow-on drugs, we believe that this is a pretty profound growth opportunity across the space. But time will tell how that ultimately plays out. The last point I would just make is that we\u2019re really the only company that touches all of these areas, MRI, PET MR, PET/CT and the radiopharmaceutical tracer. And what\u2019s interesting about the radiopharmaceuticals is \u2013 and I think you know this well, is unlike other drugs or a generic where it can be vialed and put on the shelf, this is a product that once it\u2019s made, it has a half-life of under 2 hours. So it starts degrading. And we already have a large network in the U.S. and Europe as well to actually distribute these radioactive isotopes. And so as they evolve and they grow with other folks coming into the marketplace, I think that\u2019s going to be an interesting opportunity for us to play as well. But I think, in the near-term, we\u2019ll see how these pieces come together. But we\u2019re super optimistic, I think, first for patients and their families; and then second, the opportunity that we can play. Anthony Petrone : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Your line is open. Ryan Zimmerman : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a nice quarter here. I wanted to just talk about the implied order growth and I appreciate you guys including that metric this quarter. I think investors were looking for that. But just the implied order growth. In the back half of the year, you faced some tougher comps, if I\u2019m not mistaken. And how to think about that in relative context to the RPO, which is down maybe about 120 basis points in total? James Saccaro : Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll start with a couple of comments and then turn it over to Pete. And overall, we do appreciate your comments in terms of including order growth. We did feel like this was an important metric for us to share. What I would say is, we\u2019re pleased with the strong second quarter orders coming in at 6%. I think, for us, we see health care providers continuing to invest globally in capacity to improve patient care. So all of that is very important for us and very \u2013 a critical driver long-term. And I would say, as we look at the second half orders growth, for us, we\u2019re very focused on kind of driving this mid-single-digit area because it\u2019s critical to the long-term model that we have as a company. For us, mid-single-digit growth is something that we\u2019re targeting for the next several years. So we\u2019re going to continue to drive performance and target that level. What I would say is, as it relates to the backlog, our backlog overall declined a bit. I think it was $19 billion and it declined to $18.4 billion, that\u2019s simply related to the fact that revenues grew faster than orders. And so we have an incredibly healthy backlog at this point. We feel quite good about the quality of the backlog as well. So I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to watch through the rest of the year because it does set up 2024 nicely if we can have a robust backlog in place as we approach Q4. So, so far, so good. There\u2019s nothing other than that dynamic of faster revenues than orders that contributed to the decline, but we\u2019ll continue to watch this. Pete? Peter Arduini : Yes. I mean, Jay, I think you covered it all. I\u2019d just say, Ryan, we were pleased with the performance, obviously, the step-up from Q1. As you know, there\u2019s still a little bit of noise in ours and many folks\u2019 numbers coming out of COVID and which countries switched at what point in time. But this is about real durable demand that we see particularly in our imaging world and across the board. But I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing aligned with our other comments about the productivity that those products bring and also the backlogs that exist because of incoming procedures. This is how you diagnose, this is how you plan, surgically guide. So there\u2019s strong demand in those aspects. And I would just say, we\u2019ve talked about our mid-term guidance out into the future being mid-single digits revenue growth. And I mean, obviously standpoint here is that we\u2019re \u2013 we feel quite good about what the orders funnel is coming in to feed that backlog to set us up for in the coming years. Ryan Zimmerman : That\u2019s very helpful. And then Jay, for you, I\u2019m looking back at the medium-term margin target from the Capital Markets Day. I think they were high teens to low 20s. And you called out the standalone costs. I assume those were factored in the guidance but just given kind of your early time in the company, maybe you can comment on whether you see those medium-term targets as more achievable, less achievable and just timing around those, if you\u2019re comfortable sharing that in terms of EBIT margins? James Saccaro : Sure. Overall, what I would say is, I feel good about the margin targets that the company has put together. From my standpoint, we\u2019re a new public company, so there\u2019s a lot of opportunity that\u2019s simply created by spinning off this enterprise. But then if you look at the drivers that we\u2019ve laid out, commercial execution, innovation and optimization, there are real opportunities underlying each of these. From a commercial execution standpoint, this idea of disciplined around pricing, it really is embedded in the culture at the company. We\u2019ve targeted 2% to 3% this year, 1% to 2% going forward. This idea of commercial execution and how we capture the real value that we\u2019re providing to health care providers in the products that we sell, I think it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to continue to bear fruit. From an innovation standpoint, I think we collectively are incredibly excited about the innovation opportunities that we have. And frankly, if I were to say, what\u2019s the biggest surprise coming in, it\u2019s the richness and the depth of the innovation portfolio and this care continuum approach, which is just really remarkable from my perspective. So I\u2019m quite excited about innovation as a driver. And then, finally and I alluded to this a little bit more, there\u2019s a lot of low-hanging fruit that we can optimize as we move forward. And that\u2019s just true of any new public company. There are real opportunities for us to rethink how we provide IT services and other areas. So there\u2019s some great opportunity there. So generally speaking, without being specific, I would say I feel quite good about it. The last comment I\u2019d make related to this is another aspect of the culture that\u2019s been impressive to me is this lean mindset. And so this idea of how do we get after optimization in our factories, how do we get after optimization in our end-to-end process, I think that\u2019s another tool in the toolbox that\u2019s going to go a long way to helping us transform the margin of the company. Ryan Zimmerman : Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Peter Arduini : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Patrick Wood : Perfect. Thank you very much for taking the questions. I\u2019ll just keep it to two quick ones, hopefully. So the first one, order books, nice plus 6%. I\u2019d love if you could give any more detail pulling apart, whether by modality and imaging or \u2013 we don\u2019t need the numbers specifically. I\u2019m just curious as to where you\u2019re seeing the biggest strength, either by modality or by region? Just a little bit more color there would be really handy. And then the second one actually is around the whole AI commentary side of things. Things like scan speed acceleration, obviously, there\u2019s implications for the installed base. But is it a function that you can take better pricing and then maybe you get better penetration in the therapeutic areas like cardiac, that means that the installed base remains healthy and large at a better price rather than needing fewer systems to scan the same number of patients, if you see what I mean? So any sense around like whether it\u2019s pricing or grow through better, let\u2019s say, adoption of radiology in areas where it wasn\u2019t previously there, just curious how you see that dynamic? Thanks. Peter Arduini : Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll start with the AI piece and then, Jay, if you want to add some color, what we can on the orders front. Look, Patrick, I think the artificial intelligence, obviously, it\u2019s affecting all areas within all the economic areas around the world in different ways. I think, in our world in particular, the first levels, what it\u2019s helped is actually kind of changing how product is used, making it more straightforward, automating many steps in productivity. So in the case of a institution that\u2019s having labor constraints, which you can include almost all, being able to actually automate, which enables more throughput on that given higher labor dollar is a big deal. And so many of our products, we have 42 approved FDA AI-integrated applications that are out there, really one of the leaders in the space, that\u2019s been a big deal. And what we focused on, I would say, different than maybe some of our competitors is, is not only on the new product but taking it back into the installed base. And why that\u2019s so important and it gives us a differentiated value is, if you have four of our MRs already and you want to add two other new sites, upgrading those MRs with the capability that literally makes them state-of-the-art image quality of today, better than what\u2019s out in the marketplace, as well as increases their productivity by 30%, 40% and sometimes 50% throughput, it\u2019s a huge deal. And obviously, the ability to upgrade your own systems is only allowed to the manufacturer and then combining that. So that\u2019s how \u2013 one area that we create significant value. The other area is simplifying kind of the diagnostic process and how that\u2019s playing out. And that starts with, honestly, beyond AI, cloud-based computing and enablement of applications for the customers. And we\u2019ll be demonstrating later this year our own store, so to speak, that allows reoccurring revenue for applications and access to them wherever that patient might be within that customer network. And then, longer term, which we\u2019re leading to and we\u2019ll be demonstrating later this year, is this whole idea of multimodal data integration. And it\u2019s a really important aspect of the AI side that if you do have multiple exams or capabilities that you can get assistance in actually interpreting in what they mean and we\u2019ll talk more about that. I think that\u2019s going to also be an important part of this Alzheimer\u2019s opportunity that we have as well as to kind of simplify, again, around a given disease state, how we actually support the case. So that\u2019s kind of it on the AI front. I think a combination of added productivity and throughput but also new capabilities to think about how you manage a disease state differently. On the orders front, Jay, I don\u2019t know what else you may want to add? James Saccaro : No, overall, like I said earlier, pleased with orders in the second quarter. I think for us that getting to that mid-single-digit really does unlock the long-term model that we have. What I would say, I don\u2019t want to unpack too much beneath what we\u2019ve shared for competitive reasons. But what I would say is, generally, we saw strength across geographies, which was great. And the 6% did include the very strong PDx number in it. So if we were to look for a more traditional line equipment type businesses, the orders growth was 4%. You could do that math, but I think it gives an illustration as to the health of the equipment businesses that we have, which is solid. Patrick Wood : Really helpful. Thanks, guys. Peter Arduini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Suraj Kalia : Good morning, everyone. Pete, can you hear me all right? Peter Arduini : Yes. Suraj Kalia : Perfect. Jay, it\u2019s a pleasure to be working with you again. Welcome to GE HealthCare. So one question for Pete and one for Jay. Jay, I\u2019ll start out with you. Corporate margin is a little over 40%. Obviously, you\u2019ve laid out a road map in terms of rationalizing TSAs, IT, product SKUs. Can you walk us through how should we think about corporate gross margins, let\u2019s say, over the next four, six, eight quarters? What are the key things that we should be looking for? That\u2019s one question for Jay. And Pete, if I could just quickly throw in a question for you, piggybacking on the AI question. I have a more higher-level question, Pete. So obviously, you\u2019ll have a lot of AI/ML in your systems. Over time, how do you envision exogenous AI systems interacting with your system AIs? Do you ultimately believe this is going to be synergistic? Do you anticipate disruption? How do you hold pricing, whether it\u2019s ChatGPT or whatever, but I\u2019m more interested on the exogenous influences as you\u2019ll try to grow and maintain your AI services business? Gentlemen, thank you for taking my questions. Peter Arduini : Thank you. Do you want to start with gross margin, Jay? James Saccaro : Sure. So overall, in the second quarter, gross margin was up, mainly driven by price and productivity, which offset inflation. And I know that wasn\u2019t your question but I share that because fundamental to our algorithm going forward is price and productivity offsetting inflation, along with the benefits of new products. So for us, this is an intense \u2013 this idea of securing a 2% to 3% price in this year\u2019s numbers, securing 1% to 2% going forward, that\u2019s a crucial enabler when coupled with a lot of the productivity initiatives that we have ongoing at the company. So I\u2019ll stop short of giving a \u2013 of giving the 2024 gross margin number. But what I can say is, there will be a lot of the benefits of TSA and G&A optimization that obviously accrue to the SG&A line. But we do expect gross margin enhancements going forward, largely based on price plus new products, plus some of this work that we\u2019re doing on productivity initiatives. Now as we think about the next couple of quarters, what I would say, generally speaking is, the third quarter will probably be in the range of the second quarter, with the fourth quarter being the highest of the year and a lot of that just has to do with seasonality benefits as is normally the case. But then as we move to next year, we\u2019ll have that discussion in the future. Peter Arduini : And on your question about AI, exogenous impacts and such, look, I think the key here is that our first level of AI that we have out right now, which again because of the combination of software upgrades and the value it brings \u2013 are bringing significantly higher margins into our sales when those are incorporated. I think an upgrade in an MRI unit relative to AIR Recon DL can have margin contribution that can rival a larger system. And I think that mix change over time is going to impact our broader products. To your point, most of our AI today is incorporated in our own proprietary Recon data. So it\u2019s kind of our domain. And as we go beyond that, we look at, say, how we\u2019re going to build this within this ecosystem and really embrace some of these technologies. The key is, to always be the face to the customer which, again, is one of our strong parts with our reach and be really trusted as someone that can help a customer navigate this ecosystem. If you think about cybersecurity, which we\u2019ve been focused on for many, many years with so many different products that are out there, the privacy of the data and really having kind of the right committees we\u2019re bringing together, we think about ethics and health care about how these come together, I think that\u2019s at its core. One of the key reasons I wanted Taha to come in as our Chief Technology Officer, his background as interventional cardiologist, worked at the FDA on data statistics and then seven years at Amazon leading AI and ML is exactly this, is to be able to distill through and look at the right partnerships that we want to leverage because of our position. I think you probably know, about half of the data created in health care, we either are directly creating and are a part of it just based on the amount of 4K plus data that\u2019s generated out of the imaging world. And with our integration and building platforms that can enable third parties but also create an ecosystem where for customers, this is the place you want to go to kind of leverage connectivity but also integrated AI apps, this is at the core of what we\u2019re focused on. And so I would say, standby, I think later this year, we\u2019ll be able to talk more about what our plans are and demonstrations around it. But this is an important part of it. We view it less as a threat, as more of how do we embrace it and give a door into health care as someone that really knows our customers well, understand their cyber concerns or security concerns and really helps think about how to solve their problems the right way. One of the interesting things that\u2019s out there today is, there\u2019s a lot of AI applications for diagnosis. But if they aren\u2019t integrated in the disease pathway the appropriate way, they actually add work and complexity. One of our expertise is, how do you integrate them into your workflow, so you get the benefit for the patient but you also get the productivity for the system. And that\u2019s really where we add a lot of value. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys, congrats on the [nice bringing share] and thanks for taking my question.. Pete, my first question for you. One of your competitors called out order declines, Russia headwinds. So when you look at your book-to-bill of 1.04, was that a clean number? Was there a Russia headwind? I\u2019m wondering what that number ex Russia headwind was? And when you think about your order growth versus your peer seeing declines, is that sort of signaling some share shifts in the industry? Peter Arduini : Yes. Look, I would say, from a standpoint of overall market and share, our philosophy has been really balanced on getting the most value for our products in all the geographies and also balancing share. An ideal scenario for us is to hold or be slightly up in share but to be able to get the right value in all the geographies. And again, this ties back to price, gross margin, all the kind of things. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been focused on. But we have done reasonably well here in the last 9, 12 months. And some of that is directly attributed to our metric we use, which is NPI vitality, which is new products generating sales. I mentioned monitoring, yet a big contributor but when you haven\u2019t had a new platform in over a decade and you bring that out, there\u2019s just a really nice installed base opportunity. And because it\u2019s more of a cutting-edge opportunity, you also have an opportunity to go into others installed base and say, \"Hey, maybe you should take a look at us.\" So I think we\u2019re in a good position from that standpoint. Look, from the Russia point of view, we\u2019ve been focused on the humanitarian support that has been supported by governments around the world. From a standpoint of call out, we didn\u2019t believe there\u2019s anything to call out because we\u2019ve actually contemplated it in our overall guidance. And I would say, in the second half, as I said, it\u2019s in there. If things drastically improve, maybe we could do a little bit better against that. But we\u2019ve been factoring that in all along about what was taking place. The added process controls and things that the U.S. government had put in place, I think the team has managed reasonably well but it\u2019s clearly had more of a extending the time to have a transaction take place. But again, just to reinforce, it\u2019s contemplated in our guidance. Vijay Kumar : And just to clarify that, Pete, how big is Russia for GE HealthCare? And what are then the declines in Russia, if at all, in 2Q? Peter Arduini : So we basically \u2013 we don\u2019t break that fully out. But Russia, as we\u2019ve said in the past, is 2% or slightly below that in that range is what it represents for us. Vijay Kumar : And the decline in 2Q? Peter Arduini : No, no. The total Russia business is roughly 2%, maybe slightly below that in sales that it represents against the whole company. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And, Jay, maybe 1 quick one for you. Your back half margins, I think there\u2019s a 200-basis point step up versus first half. Looking at 2Q, it seems like OpEx came in slightly above. Maybe just talk about visibility in the back half margin step up? James Saccaro : Yes. I think in the second quarter, it was an important improvement from the first quarter. We saw 70 basis points of margin expansion. And what I\u2019d like to see, Vijay, is we did that in the face of fairly substantial R&D growth, which is great as we look to accelerate some of the new products that we have and some of the excitement there. So 70 basis points improvement from Q1 to Q2. As we move to the second half of the year, what I would say is, the third quarter is probably going to be along the lines of the second quarter from an overall margin standpoint. We always do have a substantial tick up in the fourth quarter and we will start to see some of the benefits from some of the activities on G&A impacting the fourth quarter. So you start to see a little bit of that impact coming through. And that\u2019s what really drives up the fourth quarter to a much higher level than we\u2019ve seen earlier in the year. And I think that\u2019s also important because it does set the stage as we move into 2024 for continued margin expansion. So I think we feel good about line of sight. We\u2019re watching things obviously very cautiously as we always are. But we have good line of sight to the margin expansion that we\u2019ve laid out. And like I say, importantly, we saw a nice second quarter and a nice imaging margin growth from Q1 to Q2, which are key enablers for us long-term. Vijay Kumar : Understood. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Yuan Zhi with B. Riley. Your line is open. Yuan Zhi : Good morning, and congrats on the strong quarter of PDx. Great to see your presence as the Nuclear Medicine Conference in Chicago. Can you provide more details on the manufacturing capacity for Vizamyl? Can you clarify how the manufacturing is contracted with manufacturing network at the moment? In other words, if there is surge in demand of this imaging agent for Alzheimer\u2019s disease, how will you adapt to that quickly? Thanks. Peter Arduini : Yes. No, great question. So as \u2013 again, your question is about Vizamyl, which is the radiopharmaceutical that is used and approved. It\u2019s one of three out there but it\u2019s the only one that actually is approved for color interpretation, meaning that you get a highlight film that actually shows a heat map, which we believe aids in the ability to kind of quantify and diagnose. As it is a radiopharmaceutical, you actually have to have a location where there\u2019s a cyclotron and which we manufacture. As well as what\u2019s called FASTlab, which is kind of a synthesis cassette-based structure, which enables fast conversion to make the product. So we offer all of those. We have our own sites and then we have a network of partners. I would just say from what we\u2019ve seen as early indications of what the uptake would be, we believe we have added capacity \u2013 adequate capacity to ramp up to meet the needs. Pending on how successful molecule 1, molecule 2 and potentially future molecules will be, we can actually ramp up capacity with our network and our own investment. So I don\u2019t see that being any type of a near-term issue for us. And again, as I had mentioned earlier, we\u2019re just really excited for patients and their families and what this opportunity means. But it\u2019s a critical point here that be able to actually have baseline visualization to see what the plaque quantification of amyloid beta is. And then after \u2013 while doing the treatment, be able to have MRI to monitor exactly how that patient is doing. And then we suspect further along being able to actually see what reduction in plaque took place later on in follow-up. So a big part of this, I think you know, is going to be the reimbursement out of CMS. We were encouraged that the one kind of Alzheimer\u2019s scan per lifetime CMS indication. They came back and said that they\u2019re looking to move that towards the MACs to make that decision. We hope that, that moves to a national coverage decision but the fact that it moved to the MACs to actually look at, it is encouraging step in the right direction. So we feel like we\u2019re in pretty good shape based on what the demand curves will look like to meet the needs. Yuan Zhi : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question in queue coming from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Hi, Jason. Jason Bednar : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on another nice quarter here. Wanted to start on PDx, that segment just put up again another quarter of really strong results. Understanding comps in the second half are a little bit tougher than the first half. You called out some of the factors influencing that situation. But I guess, is it right to think the absolute revenue run rate up here around $550 million to $575 million. Is that the correct baseline for PDx now moving forward? And then are there any notable geographic trends you\u2019d call out when we look at that PDx strength? Peter Arduini : Go ahead, Jay. James Saccaro : Sure. On PDx, we did have a shutdown in the second quarter of our manufacturing facility in China related to COVID and that reopened in the third \u2013 there was a \u2013 it reopened towards the end of the second quarter, into the third quarter. So we did \u2013 we have a very challenging comp in the third quarter. That\u2019s what everybody is referring to. And so what I would say is, from a total dollar standpoint, yes, I think that we\u2019re \u2013 that\u2019s the right range in terms of overall sales. But the growth rates will look a bit distorted by some of those comparator issues, as we look at last year. But I think your comment is a good one. I mean this is a great business for us. We\u2019re pleased with the growth that we\u2019ve seen and this will be an important driver, also as it relates to the last question as well. So this is a nice source of growth for us. I don\u2019t know, Pete, if you\u2019d add anything? Peter Arduini : Yes. No, just the fact that if you think of our PDx business, it\u2019s fundamentally about a 70-30 contrast agent imaging business and 30% molecular imaging. And obviously, the more molecular imaging grows over time, whether it be theranostics or Alzheimer\u2019s, other things I had mentioned about FES PET getting into metastatic breast cancer, that\u2019s going to grow with even higher margins than the traditional side of the house. That being said, you really can\u2019t do a vascular study without contrast. Obviously, without the agents, there\u2019s actually limited capacity throughout the world. And we\u2019ve \u2013 as we\u2019ve talked about as well, committed to making the proper investments to shore up supply in the respectable markets. But, to Jay\u2019s point, it will be a little lumpy here over the next couple of quarters because of the shutdown we had in Q2 last year, but we feel quite good about it. Think about all the surge in procedures that are taking place, for interventional procedures in cardiac, many of the different procedures that are happening that you\u2019re seeing for other implantable devices. In many cases, there is a study that involves a with or without contrast study to get them there and that\u2019s one of the underlying drivers in the marketplace. Jason Bednar : All right. Very helpful, guys. And then maybe just as a follow-up for Jay. I appreciate all the color on gross margins here today in terms of modeling forward and the various impacts. I want to drill down maybe a bit more on imaging gross margin. You called out inflation from past component purchases as a factor and it\u2019s totally understandable here, just as everybody is dealing with the inflationary effects. And then as you prepare with your balance and your inventory and whatnot. But as you look at your backlog and where you\u2019re at with imaging product inventory, are we past the worst of those component inflation headwinds? And then along those lines, could you offer maybe some comments or your level of comfort around seeing imaging segment margins improve further in the second half from where we finished in 2Q? Thanks guys. James Saccaro : Sure. So really a nice performance in the second quarter on imaging. I think that entire team is incredibly focused on margin enhancements and gross margin, in particular, along with pricing and productivity improvement. So I think that\u2019s a \u2013 it was a great enhancement from the 7.7% to 10.6%. We do expect the second half of the year to be above the first half for imaging. And a lot of that does come down to some of these inflation purchases that we\u2019ve had in the second half of last year, they do start to lessen from an impact standpoint. And frankly, this is our longest lead time business. And so we do see \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s kind of lingered for the longest period of time. But we\u2019ll start to see that ease in the second half of the year. So that will be another incremental tailwind for imaging margins. So you can expect to see, like I say, second half above first half, hopefully setting the stage for a nice 2024. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Arduini for any closing remarks. Peter Arduini : So thank you for joining us today. And look, we\u2019re excited about the significant opportunities ahead as we work to help transform the future of health care and focus on the enablement of precision care. We look forward to connecting you at one of our upcoming conferences. Thanks for your time today. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Carolynne Borders, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin. Carolynne Borders : Thanks, operator. Welcome to GE HealthCare's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I'm joined by our President and CEO, Peter Arduini; and our Vice President and CFO, Jay Saccaro. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's press release and in the presentation slides available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Peter. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Carolynne. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter call. To start, I want to say, we're pleased with our growth, margin and cash flow performance in the quarter. Recently, we've launched several new products which I'll talk about in greater detail later and announced multiple strategic artificial intelligence-based collaborations aimed at supporting new product introductions and clinical applications. We're honored to have received a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop ultrasound tools for less experienced health care professionals and support more effective obstetric and lung ultrasound screening for patients in low and middle-income countries. We also signed a contract with BARDA, a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services develop advanced ultrasound technology with new AI applications for patients with lung pathologies and traumatic injuries. Both of these combined represent over $80 million of committed funding. Lastly, we announced a strategic collaboration with Mayo Clinic for innovation in medical imaging and theranostics to enhance precision diagnosis and improve patient treatment by using multimodal data, AI and digital health solutions. We're excited about our recent collaborations and how this will help us deliver on our Precision Care strategy. The business has demonstrated resiliency and our team has executed this year. We're on track to meet our goals we set at the beginning of the year and we're making good progress on our mid-range targets. Despite several macro challenges that occurred in 2023, we have been intensely focused on financial and operational execution to deliver on our commitments. Turning to slide three. We delivered strong third quarter performance with 6% year-over-year organic revenue growth, driven by volume and price. Importantly, book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.03 times, slightly below our book-to-bill of 1.04 times in the second quarter. Customer site rising procedure backlog as a reason for capital investments, particularly for products that we offer. Backlog remains robust at $18.4 billion, driven by Services and Imaging products and remains more than $1 billion higher than pre-COVID levels, which gives us confidence in future quarters. Orders growth was 1% versus the same period last year. We recently completed a customer pulse survey in the US and see no significant change in sentiment on capital spending in the second half of 2023 versus the first half of the year. Orders growth can be lumpy in any given quarter and results do not directly translate to near-term revenue growth. And this is why we give book-to-bill metric as well as total backlog. As it relates to China and the anticorruption campaign, we saw a limited impact to our orders and revenue in the quarter. Both measures were up year-over-year. We continue to expect a limited impact in the fourth quarter. Also, as a reminder, fourth quarter 2022 orders experienced significant growth due to the China stimulus launch last year, which will influence the year-over-year comparisons next quarter. China continues to be an important market with a promising growth profile. During the quarter, we continued to make steady progress on our productivity initiatives and business optimization using lean. For example, delivery performance has improved over 15%, a direct result of implementing pool methodology. The number of purchase components classified as high risk for availability has reduced by approximately 35% year-to-date and customer lead times have improved by more than 15% versus the prior year. And lastly, customer satisfaction surveys for service have improved approximately 10%, supported by improvement in parts availability and the great efforts by the service team. On the profit line, we generated adjusted EBIT margin expansion, while simultaneously accelerating R&D investment. This speaks to our execution capabilities as well as our commitment to funding long-term innovation. Turning to capital allocation. We remain committed to executing an optimized strategy with a focus on creating value for shareholders. Our strong free cash flow generation in the third quarter positions us to be flexible in our capital allocation priorities. We aim to deliver a dividend while continuing to evaluate organic and inorganic investments and deleveraging opportunities. Overall, global markets have remained resilient. Our backlog remains healthy and our team continues to execute. As a result, we're raising the low end of our adjusted 2023 EPS range representing growth of 11% to 14%. Jay will now take you through our financials and business performance. Jay? Jay Saccaro : Thanks, Pete. Starting with our financial performance on Slide 4. For the third quarter of 2023, revenues of $4.8 billion increased 5% year-over-year and grew 6% organically. This was driven by increased volume and price. Book-to-bill was healthy at 1.03x. Order dollars remain strong and continue to outpace revenues. On a stand-alone basis, third quarter adjusted EBIT margin was 15.4%. Sequentially, margin improved 60 basis points benefiting from increased volume and productivity actions. Year-over-year, we generated 120 basis points of margin expansion through productivity initiatives and price, partially offset by planned investments and inflation. I'll elaborate on the actions we're taking to expand our margin shortly. Adjusted EPS was $0.99, down 18% versus prior year due to interest expense, but up 14% on a stand-alone basis driven by increased volume. Free cash flow was up year-over-year due to our strong performance and inventory management. Moving to Slide 5. Revenues grew 6% organically year-over-year. On a reported basis, product revenue increased 6% year-over-year and service revenue grew 5%. We saw strong organic revenue growth across all regions. As it relates to margin performance please turn to Slide 6. Our adjusted gross margin of 41% in the third quarter was strong driven by pricing and enhanced execution by our commercial teams as well as variable cost productivity initiatives that we're driving. For example, in services productivity, we see lower logistics costs for parts and improved operational rigor. We also benefited from improving volumes and higher-margin new product introductions. We're optimizing our G&A spend by rationalizing our real estate footprint and also simplifying our IT services and systems across the businesses to create efficiencies as we scale. We've also exited 130 transition service agreements to date. We expect some of the larger scale actions to have a greater impact on results in 2024 and beyond. We've made good progress and remain on track to deliver on our 2023 adjusted EBIT margin expansion guidance. This is primarily driven by gross margin expansion, as we continue to invest in R&D which was approximately 7% of revenues in the quarter. Now let's discuss our segments. Turning to imaging on Slide 7. We generated organic revenue growth of 5% versus the same period last year. This follows several quarters of strong year-over-year revenue growth reflecting solid backlog and improved fulfillment in price. Revenue growth in the third quarter was driven by MI, CT and MR. This included growth from several new product introductions aimed at driving improved patient outcomes and increased efficiency. Segment EBIT margin improved 150 basis points year-over-year as we made progress in driving productivity price and delivering higher volume all of this more than offset planned investments. Importantly, EBIT margin also improved 150 basis points on a sequential basis. As previously noted, we expected that it would take a few quarters before pricing measures would catch up to inflation headwinds and we're now seeing that happen. Turning to Ultrasound on Slide 8. Organic revenue was down 1% year-over-year as we faced a challenging comparison versus the third quarter of 2022, when we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth.  Recall, that the third quarter last year was the first quarter in which we started to realize improvements in our access to components for this business. Looking at the two-year average Ultrasound revenue grew in the mid-single digits. The market is stabilizing following COVID and supply chain challenges. We're continuing to execute and maintain our global leadership position. During the quarter we saw solid demand for newly launched products, in our Women's Health and Cardiovascular businesses. Segment EBIT margin of 22% was down 360 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to planned investments including cash and health and inflation. These were partially offset by productivity improvements. Our margin performance reflects our commitment to both organic and inorganic investment as well as technology leadership through AI integration, as we seek to enhance precision diagnostics. In the US, our venue point-of-care product portfolio now features AI for cardiac exams. This AI Guidance Technology provides real-time step-by-step guidance, to allow even new users to capture diagnostic-quality cardiac images. We closed the Caption Health acquisition in February, within six months we incorporated this technology into our portfolio and we're evaluating other Ultrasound use cases to drive future growth. Moving to Patient Care Solutions on Slide 9. Organic revenue was up 9% driven by volume and price, as we were able to fulfill more backlogs. Revenue improved as we continue to realize the benefits of supply chain-related actions taken over the past year. Performance was also driven by contribution from NPIs. PCS margin increased 120 basis points compared to the third quarter last year driven by productivity volume growth and price, partially offset by planned investments and inflation. Investments support our monitoring portfolio transformation which enables broader metrics and device interoperability. We're excited about the new monitoring products that we recently launched and their impact over the next few quarters. Finally, moving to Pharmaceutical Diagnostics on Slide 10, we had another strong quarter generating 12% year-over-year organic revenue growth. Segment EBIT margin of 28.2% improved 140 basis points sequentially, but declined 230 basis points year-over-year due to raw material inflation and planned investments. This was partially offset by price and productivity actions and volume. We've seen PDx EBIT margin stabilized and we're encouraged by the strong continued growth of global imaging procedures which drive the need for contrast agents. Turning to Slide 11, I'll walk through our cash flow performance. We delivered strong results this quarter with free cash flow of $570 million, up $22 million year-over-year. This was driven by better inventory management while absorbing interest and post-retirement benefit payments. Inventory improved versus the prior year period, as we continue to leverage lean and solidify our inventory daily management system. We're also realizing benefits from easing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressure. We saw solid results in controlling inputs while driving inventory turns for faster revenue conversion through lean events and activities organized across the business. I'm pleased with the fast progress addressing our legacy liabilities and cost structure. In fact, in the past quarter, we were able to achieve agreement to freeze our largest U.S. pension plan conserving cash that can now be allocated to fund investments to grow our business. The solid cash flow profile of our business positions us well for continued investment and deleveraging and we remain on track to deliver free cash flow conversion of 85% or more for the full year. Now, let's turn to the outlook on Slide 12. We continue to expect organic revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%. As a reminder, our fourth quarter organic revenue growth will be compared against a very strong performance of 13% growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to expect full year adjusted EBIT margin in the range of 15.0% to 15.5% and the adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25% for the full year. And given the strong performance to-date, we're now raising the low end of our full year 2023 adjusted EPS range to $3.75 to $3.85 versus the prior range of $3.70 to $3.85 per share. With that, I'll hand the call back to Pete. Peter Arduini : Thanks Jay. Next on slide 13. I want to touch on a few exciting areas where GE HealthCare is investing to advance our precision care strategy. In Imaging, we continue to make progress on the development of our photon counting CT technology. We've added Stanford Medicine as a research partner to scan human subjects on our photon counting CT prototype with deep silicone detectors. This innovation aims to enhance imaging capabilities and provide clinicians the information and data they need to improve patient outcomes across many care pathways. Photon counting CT technology with deep Silicon unique to GE HealthCare has the potential to go well beyond the capabilities of traditional CT, and we look forward to continuing to gather data and incorporate feedback that will move our program forward. In Ultrasound, we recently announced a collaboration with Novo Nordisk to advance the clinical and product development of peripheral focused ultrasound. This marks our introduction into therapeutic ultrasound exploring non-invasive, non-pharmacological methods to treat chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Encouraging preclinical and early clinical data indicate potential use for people with type 2 diabetes. We are incredibly excited about the potential for this novel technology and its impact on improving patient care. In PDx, we recently made some exciting announcements to advance our delivery of precision care. For example, we signed a licensing agreement with SOFIE Biosciences for Phase 2 diagnostic tracers. The development of FAPI diagnostic targeted agents holds great potential for oncology and other conditions including inflammation fibrosis and arthritis by enabling detection of small primary or metastatic lesions. Finally, for the second year in a row, we topped the FDA's list with the most artificial intelligence-enabled device authorizations of any med tech company with 58. Through focused R&D spend we're committed to bringing high-growth innovative technologies to our customers to improve the way healthcare is delivered. These innovations will create differentiating value for GE HealthCare. Turning to slide 14. We recently centralized our Care Pathway strategy under our Chief Technology Officer. To us, leading our efforts to ensure that we are connecting our products across modalities for each disease state, enabled by our digital solutions. On our last earnings call, I touched on this topic of Alzheimer's disease. Today, I'll discuss cardiology as an example, specifically A-Fib to articulate how our solutions comprehensively address this condition. A-Fib as many of you may know is the most common arrhythmia diagnosed in clinical practice, affecting millions of people worldwide. It's often misdiagnosed or not treated appropriately with up to 30% of cases missed in routine clinical exams. To advance our A-Fib care pathway, we recently launched CardioVisio, which integrates, organizes and visualizes longitudinal patient data from multiple devices. Taking this data along with current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology, we were able to provide evidence-based clinical decision support from detection through monitoring. CardioVisio connects and presents the most relevant patient data from across the care pathway. And this helps to save time and identify more patients eligible for recommended therapies. This launch is an important step on our journey to integrate devices and digital solutions to assist cardiologists and caring for patients across the entire cardiovascular care pathway. In the future, we plan to expand CardioVisio to address additional areas such as, coronary artery disease and structural heart. We also expect to launch similar innovations to support oncology and neurology by linking multi-vendor devices, digital and disease-based solutions to better serve our customers and drive growth. Turning to Slide 15. In summary, we've made substantial financial and operational progress year-to-date, demonstrating that our strategy is working. Our team continues to execute and I'd like to thank all of our employees across the world for their dedication and efforts. Before taking your questions, I want to highlight the recent release of our first sustainability report since becoming an independent company. Corporate responsibility is core to our vision, and it embodies our purpose to create a world where health care has no limits. To learn more about our sustainability goals and future plans, visit our ESG page on our website. With that, let's open up our call to questions. Carolynne Borders : Thank you, Peter. I\u2019d like to ask participants to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up. Operator, can you please open the line? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vijay Kumar with Evercore. Your line is open. Q \u2013 Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. Congrats on a good -- Good morning, Peter. Congratulations and good execution here. And thanks for taking my question. I did want to touch upon your order commentary here. What was that China in the quarter? And can you quantify, what the order growth was for your capital book of business? And if you can have those numbers ex China, I think there's some debate on how big of a deal is China to order. Peter Arduini : Yes, Vijay, let me -- I'll start at a high level and then see Jay wants to add some comments. I'd just start by saying, that we're continuing to see solid end market demand really around the world including China and I'll talk about that a little bit more specifically Again, if you step back you'll recall that in 2021 2022, as customers all of us were coming out of COVID, we saw really strong demand in different products from an orders growth standpoint. Ventilators obviously, but CT ultrasound, monitoring for continuous monitoring. And then that was followed by 2023 this year, which is essentially a transition year with tougher comparisons. But that's what we planned for. And so as we look ahead here really going even into 2024, we're expecting that to be kind of the first year with more of a normalized market environment since COVID, which we obviously view as very positive. So relative to Q3, it's been as kind of printed market I would say, is how we've seen things. If you switch over to your point on China, I'd say, we saw a limited impact to orders and sales in Q3. As I mentioned in the comments here, we were actually up in orders and sales over 2022 in Q3 and we expect limited impact in Q4. So it's good results overall there. And I'm just proud of eHow and our team in China really did a really nice job and worked through some tough challenges as you can imagine. We're starting to see signs of the anticorruption campaign stabilize here. We started to -- in late September. I think a lot of market events in early August were kind of stopped, but then resumed by October. There was a recent anesthesia congress, that all reports was back to full capacity whereas certain meetings early were low. So, we believe that we're going to see a similar kind of trend here continue on in the fourth quarter. Q \u2013 Vijay Kumar : Understood. And I had one follow-up here on margins perhaps, both for you and Jay. I think clearly you mentioned products like CardioVisio, AI solutions. How do you price these solutions? And what's the margin profile for these kinds of products and related to margins, I think you mentioned price caught up with inflation. Is that something we should be expecting to sustain into fiscal 2024? Thank you. Peter Arduini : Yes, Vijay, maybe I'll start and then Jay, you can talk a little bit more about price. So we're still early innings on the AI monetization but it's super exciting. Obviously, we're humbled to be in one of the leadership roles to have new applications out. But the way we think about the start is, AI inside our products which is really across our portfolio now, as those products come out they will bring in some cases 3 4 5-plus points of margin accretion, on a given product to enable that. I think our example that we talk about is an MR where an MR system that has AIR Recon DL and it has quite a bit of step-up of margin over one that doesn't. And so that's going to continue to grow. As we bring something like CardioVisio in which you mentioned which again we're just beginning to roll out as kind of a core offering that will go across many products and will incorporate AI over time that will be a SaaS model where it will be a reoccurring revenue model. I would say, we will price it based on value structure. And from a margin standpoint, we would expect that to have typical software margins something north of 75%, 80% in that range. And so this is going to be a couple year evolution as we grow this. But this again we believe is the future of multimodal data and really adding value to help solve customers' issues. So Jay maybe you want to comment about price.\\ Jay Saccaro : Sure. Vijay, we previously discussed expecting price impacts on sales this year in the 2% to 3% range. And then over the midterm plan that we've laid out continuing to see 1% to 2% price. And a lot of that is about the execution framework we have in place a culture around disciplined in pricing. And all of those ingredients are intact. So I would say we're very much on track for the 2% to 3% this year and we see signs that support the longer-term execution pathway that we previously laid out. Vijay Kumar : Thanks. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Your line is open. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking the question. This is the time of the year we start looking forward. And I'm curious about a couple of things. In any particular order how you're feeling about 2024 street revenue consensus or mid single-digits? And is there anything about the order book year-to-date that would imply or give implications for 2024 that you can share now? Jay Saccaro : Hi, Joanne thanks for the question. The -- we're going to -- we'll stop short of giving guidance at this point but I would say that -- I would say a few things that can provide some color. First, really pleased with the execution so far this year. I think our continued focus on orders execution our continued focus on sales execution and margin enhancement really do set the stage for successful delivery of 2024 and beyond. Secondly, I would point to the backlog that we have in place. The backlog from Q2 to Q3 was essentially flat despite 6% revenue growth. And a lot of that comes down to a book-to-bill that's continued to be in excess of one. And so we're really happy with the backlog that's set up for 2024. The final thing I would say is we do regularly survey customers. Pete alluded to some of this. And we're seeing a decent backdrop set up for 2024. I think all of these elements are key ingredients and successfully delivering 2024. And so we're very focused on that as we go through our planning process in the coming weeks and months. Pete anything to add? Peter Arduini : No, I think you covered it. I think the point about the customer feedback is really the most important part. I mean, Jay and myself obviously our old teams get out quite a bit around the world. And talk one-on-one with CEOs and leaders of health systems. And again both the commentary as well as our surveys that we do routinely kind of lean to the fact that second half compared to first half is very consistent on market and capital outlook. We're not a company that's typically driven by procedures but obviously the procedures drive our business and that continues to be strong. And then I would say we're hearing more and more incremental positive views about 2024 from customers. You've seen prints recently from some customers but also just from a standpoint of with their aging installed base and the procedural growth many customers are thinking ahead about their needs in future. And obviously, we see this as a healthy outlook. So we're optimistic about how we see making the turn into 2024. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Peter Arduini : Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone with Mizuho. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Good morning, Anthony Anthony Petrone : Good afternoon, Pet. Good morning, Jay. Congrats on another strong quarter here. I think I'll stay on the 2024 theme and maybe just to level set where the backlog conversion to forward revenues sort of sits on maybe an 18-month go-forward basis. So as we look at the ending backlog is it \u2013 should we be thinking that it's feasible that 60% of the backlog can be converted over the next 18 months? And are there any areas where that backlog conversion possibly got extended. We heard some competitors talking about elongated cycles for instance in China. And I'll have a quick follow-up for Jay on margins. Peter Arduini : Yes Anthony, I would say when we think about our backlog we actually felt it's quite solid. I mentioned that it was $18 and change \u2013 $18.4 billion. With book-to-bill you know how the math works as we actually are having a book-to-bill that's positive meaning that it's actually more orders are going in than revenues going out. We'll start next year with a backlog that's pretty close to where we are today which is super healthy. And it's about $1 billion above where we were pre-COVID. So that gives you plenty of gas in the tank to be able to continue to drive revenue. And again with this business that can be lumpy on the orders front that's an important dynamic. I mentioned in China. I know there's been a lot of different news from different companies. We obviously felt the effects of the China anticorruption earlier about customers disengaging at some level but as that reintegrated in later in the quarter obviously, we put up good numbers with being able to outperform the previous year. The only other comment I would say relative to Q3 in the US towards the end of the quarter we did see some longer deals taking a little bit longer. And as you kind of peel the onion back on that what it really is about is that some customers are seeing some higher project costs more on the labor and construction side for install compared to their initial budgets. And so the deals are getting done for sure. But what that means is they may have to go back to their finance committee and say \"Hey this is going to be $100000 more and actually get another approval\". And so I think that works its way through the systems as those estimates and the actual cost match up in the coming quarters. But that's probably the only thing we've seen that has kind of played out on the time horizon. Anthony Petrone : Very helpful. And quickly Jay just on the implied 4Q earnings would be $0.09 midpoint is up by $0.02 for 4Q. So just anything of note and as we look into the back end of the year here for the margin trajectory? And if there are any headwinds that we're seeing do those potentially slip into the first half of 2024. Again thanks and congratulations. Jay Saccaro : Yes. Thank you \u2013 thanks for the question and the comment. Overall, we're pleased with the performance year-to-date. I think what we've seen across the board is the resiliency of the portfolio continued focus on margin execution. I think all the key ingredients are in place. By the way I would also point out very strong free cash flow performance in the third quarter, which is an intense area of focus for us. So I feel very good about what we delivered in the third quarter. As we move to the fourth quarter the probability \u2013 our confidence in our ability to achieve the full year outlook has definitely increased. We raised the low end by $0.05 which implies $0.025. We don't really have material changes to the fourth quarter outlook. We feel solid about that. I would point out that there were a couple of cents of FX. The way our FX forecast worked out and the subsequent rate moves we had a bit of favorability in EBIT in the third quarter related to foreign exchange a couple of cents. And then the fourth quarter is a couple of cents lighter than the forecast we put together. That's the most noteworthy item. Other than that I think we're going to focus on continued execution in the fourth quarter and setting ourselves up for a successful 2024. Anthony Petrone : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Patrick Wood : Amazing. Thanks for taking the question. I mean taking a step back historically, it was tough to get paid for innovation. You have the slice wars and then you add Freelium and it was always kind of difficult to get price. But today, you guys did a great job in taking price mix on some of the recent innovations. I guess my question is like what do you think has changed? Is it just that the scope of innovation happening today is higher? And how should we interpret that so how you're thinking about pricing for photon counting longer-term? Thanks. Peter Arduini : Yeah, Patrick good question. Look, I think it's a convergence of many different things. Obviously, with the higher cost that took place during the COVID window sometimes that's a necessity for all to kind of reflect on your pricing strategies and where you are. And so I think that's some level of a beginning catalyst. It's been a really important part of our kind of strategy as a company to talk about that we want to be paid fairly for what we come up with. I think when you look at the ROI on many of the products we make they pay for themselves in months not years. And many of these products are held for seven to eight years. So the return on investment whether you're paying 2% money or 8% money, is still very, very good. And I think that's part of it. And getting the confidence in your commercial teams that that's the reality and how to sell that value I think that's been part of it. The other aspect is innovation investments. If you're innovating and coming out with something every three to five years, versus something new every 18 months that you can actually ask a little bit more for, because it actually creates more value that also brings price up. And that's an important part of our strategy. But at the end of the day, we have to demonstrate that we bring more value for customers and show that the returns are there. And I think things such on the digital side and artificial intelligence that can actually reduce workflow issues. It can actually take work out of the system, and actually can treat more patients is a winner. We talked about Air Recon DL. You have a 10-year-old product. We do an upgrade. We actually ask a reasonable value for that that's higher margin than we would typically get on just a hardware alone. And you get a 50% increase in throughput and we also take your capabilities to state-of-the-art. Those are the kind of things that we're excited about. And I think more of the software applications and capabilities we have coming forward are going to deliver on that. Patrick Wood : Got it. Just as a very quick follow-up. Are you seeing anything notable on spec. I mean, like maybe with some of the bundled deals a higher proportion of free Tesla or like anything on the spec across the different modalities. Peter Arduini : When you say spec you're talking about different specifications on the modalities changes? Patrick Wood : Yeah, because obviously not every MR and CT scanners equivalent. And obviously, with -- especially with some of the bundled deals I'm curious as to how people are bundling purchasing and less direct pricing or the systems themselves that they're buying within those? Peter Arduini : Yeah. I think look it's what's becoming and as you know in this industry there are very few kind of brand-new customers to imaging, right? If you just take imaging and even take monitoring or anesthesia out of it. And so there tends to be a much larger fleet discussion that takes place. You don't need state-of-the-art everywhere but you need workforce systems in certain parts, whereas you may need certain really cutting-edge capabilities in other areas. I mean, this whole Alzheimer's discussion that we're kind of helping sure for certain customers through on their fleet is where do you need the PET capabilities at? Where do you need the certain MR capabilities? How is that tied to infusion center? There's a lot more of that discussion going on. And it tends to be a little bit more of a heterogeneous installed base based on needs. But again, that's how we can demonstrate how do you match up what you're trying to achieve this through customer with which products that you need. And so this idea of a multisite fleet strategy is becoming more and more part of what we do both domestically, as well as big markets around the world. Patrick Wood : Awesome. Thank you for taking the questions. Peter Arduini : Thank you, Patrick. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Good morning, Larry. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks for taking the \u2013 hey, good morning, Pete and Jay. Sorry one more on orders. I continue to get e-mails from people on this. So I'm going to ask you originally expected mid-single-digit order growth in 2023. Is that still the case? And if not just help us understand how you can grow revenues mid-single digits in 2024, if order growth is below that, or how does order growth translate? Why doesn't it translate into revenue growth the following year? And I had one follow-up on margins. Jay Saccaro : Sure. So Larry in terms of order growth, I think one of the key things to consider is the book-to-bill ratio. We are still in excess orders in excess of sales by a margin of 1.03 times, this quarter. And we expect over time that's something that we've seen for essentially the last seven or even more quarters. We've seen very robust book-to-bill ratio. And what that does is it allows us to set up a backlog, which can allow for successful execution on sales in future years. So, I think for us there's always volatility in a given quarter on orders. We've discussed that as it relates to this particular quarter. But overall we feel quite good about what we've been able to execute on from both an order standpoint, from a book-to-bill standpoint, and then also a high-quality backlog standpoint. I think those are the three ingredients all of which that we have to look at in conjunction with one another when we look at the health of the portfolio and the revenue projections that we have in place. So, I think really that's the overall story. We don't really give orders guidance per se. It's something that we target over time. But we feel good about the setup. And furthermore as we think about how customers are feeling the surveys that we've done and also the customer reports that we're seeing indicate that the backdrop should be pretty good going into next year. So I don't know those would be a few comments that I'd make. Pete I don't know if you want to add anything. Peter Arduini : Yes, I think you hit it. I think the key here is that the backlog is very healthy and that we exit the year with really the same level if not larger backlog than how we started. So, we're in that same range again which gives us confidence going forward. I would point out PDx continues to be strong as well which actually isn't a backlog business but that's a continual contract business as well as service growth. I mean we talked about last year gaining some share continuing to do so as we started this year. And the benefit of that is once the warranty period rolls off 113 you move into contracts. And so that's beginning to drive more service growth which has higher margins. It also has multiyear continuum to it. So, about half of our revenues are capital so to speak on a win basis on of the week whereas the rest of the business is actually recurring. So, we feel good Larry about the position of where we're at right now all things considered in the world. Larry Biegelsen : That's super helpful. And on the margins the company talked about getting to high teens to 20% adjusted EBIT margin over the medium term which I think you guys defined is three to five years from 2022 or 2023. And before we initiated coverage Jay the company defined that I think is about 17% in 2025 20% in 2027. Has anything changed? Are those still the goals? And is there any reason margins shouldn't increase next year? Thanks. Jay Saccaro : Sure. I think as I've spent a lot of time on margin since joining the company a few months ago. And what I would say is we feel quite good about the margin plan. It starts with this culture of lean at the company. I've been really impressed with this idea the lean mindset and how we're driving operational execution improvements across the board. And so that's culturally an important backdrop. We've previously outlined three drivers of margin enhancements and I think all of them are intact. First, commercial execution. We've talked a lot about pricing today. It's a real area of focus for us in all of our business reviews and we've seen dividends this year and we expect continued pricing impact. The second area of focus is innovation. New products being introduced with higher margins. Pete talked about that earlier today. And we've seen that across the board and we talked about that extensively during the prepared remarks. And then finally this idea of optimization. And optimization comes in a lot of different ways productivity variable cost productivity initiatives that we have in place managing spot buys managing logistics costs managing G&A costs as well. Those are all clear areas of focus for us. And what I would say is on a year-to-date basis, we feel quite good. The third quarter was up 120 basis points over the prior year. We were able to execute on a few different areas of margin enhancement. And by the way Larry we were able to grow R&D a very significant amount. So, what we're trying to do is drive productivity and efficiency at the company while at the same time protecting dollars for investment in growth in areas like R&D. So far so good and we look forward to continuing to on that path as we move forward. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Your line is open. Ryan Zimmerman : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of clarifying questions first for me. Did China actually grow because if I look at comments from Philips United Imaging Mind Ray, I mean all saw very meaningful declines. And I'm just trying to get a sense of what is happening in China and whether you guys are winning some share there or if the market is down as much as some of the others have suggested? Peter Arduini : Ryan, we were up. So -- and we were up over where we were the previous year. Obviously, could we've done better if we didn't have the anticorruption most likely, but the team did a very nice job on it. I think when you think about many of the different businesses, we have different cycles. I would say that if you're heavily predominantly a sell and install business, meaning you take an order in the quarter and you ship in the quarter, the anticorruption early effect could have had a strong effect on you. If you have more of a backlog and there's not a transaction, it's actually delivering it and shipping it for revenue. I think it could have a less effect on you. And we tend to have a larger backlog-based business. But in general, I just give a lot of credit to our China team that has done a really nice job being able to continue to execute in a market that has been a little bit unpredictable, but it's a market that we believe is -- continues to be a very important growth market into the future and all signs are that it's going to continue to grow in the future. But again, to translate into Q4, I would say we start Q4 with a much healthier view of China than we started Q3, but we still think there's going to be some level of effect equivalent to Q3 that will exist throughout this quarter as well. Ryan Zimmerman : Very helpful, Pete. And then Jay, you called out the TSAs. I'm just curious kind of where you're at from a percentage standpoint in terms of rolling off TSAs from GE what kind of impact do you expect from those in 2024? Jay Saccaro : Sure. We're pleased with the progress on TSA exits. So far we've exited approximately 130 of those about 20 were exited early. And a lot of this relates to IT supply chain facilities and then some other areas like HR and finance. So that whole program is on track. And as we think about 2024 and beyond, it's really important for us to get to independence to get the stability and then that allows us to unlock some incremental cost savings opportunities. For example, we have to make sure that we get our IT system stable and then we can talk about all the wonderful opportunities for optimization that we have. And so it's a real area of focus for us. And what I would say is so far so good as it relates to becoming an independent company supporting ourselves, pleased with the progress of the 130. We have a lot that are underway right now. At the end of this year beginning of next year, we'll make significantly more progress in terms of eliminating TSAs. And that starts to set the stage for incremental margin expansion as a stand-alone company. Ryan Zimmerman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Jason Bednar : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a good quarter here. Want to follow up on some of the prior questions on orders. Sorry to beat the horse here. But I think your comments on China will come as a relief today, but can you maybe provide some of that same directional commentary for orders in your other major geographies like the US or Europe for the third quarter? Was the US down a little bit based on some of those project cost comments you made? And does that mean Europe was up really just trying to put the puzzle together there. And then, is there anything you'd call out for us to keep in mind from a comp perspective for the US or Europe like you mentioned with the China Simples program? Peter Arduini : Yeah. I'll comment just on some of the markets and then maybe Jay you can comment on any of the comp comparison pieces that are there that I missed. But again, I think on the broader market particularly the US, we continue to see a solid backdrop. You heard me talk about the only kind of item that we did see was towards the end of the quarter some of the larger deals. We're taking a little bit longer because of this point that some customers when they estimated what the total project would cost versus when they were ready to cut POs they had a little bit higher cost. And so they had to go back through their process to get approval, which again sometimes could add 30 could add 60 days to the process. And again, I don't think this is a lasting item. I think as the estimates tighten up with what the real costs are going to be that will play out. And it's not wide scale. I think there's some major cities in the United States where the cost of labor and public work so to speak have gone up higher. That's really the piece there. I do think as we talk to most customers, Western Europe and the United States this pent-up amount of backlog of people waiting to get procedures whether they be cardiovascular, oncology, orthopedic procedures, the need for imaging, the need for other types of critical care support whether it be monitoring or anesthesia, we're still seeing as much demand or pent-up capacity, pent-up demand that's pushing on capacity as we did at the beginning of the year. Specifically for Europe, the team has been executing well on a tough macro environment. Obviously Ukraine, Russia and then some of the conflict in the Middle East. But with regards to our customers, we're seeing some of the similar dynamics as we see in the US with the approval process left taking longer, but there's clearly some regional variances by country, but we continue to see the funnel of opportunities growing. And again I think the trends are positive from a patient backlog procedure standpoint as well. And so again in general as we get out and speak with customers around the world, it's quite positive. The rest of the world, I would say Southeast Asia and Latin America actually continues to be very bright. We're starting to see some countries in Southeast Asia that are deciding to invest pretty significant amounts to grow their capabilities. And one of the first steps they typically invest in is having high diagnostic capabilities for their folks within their region. So that's kind of the view at that point. I don't know Jay if anything to add. Jay Saccaro : No, I think that\u2019s sufficient. Thanks. Ryan Zimmerman : Great. Thanks. And then one follow-up just seeing a disclosure in the 10-Q regarding the amendment to your employee pension plan with benefits frozen effective December of next year. I know you mentioned in your prepared remarks Jay, can you provide some additional comments here just what's changing with this amendment? What are the mechanics? What does it mean from a liability or cash flow perspective for GE Healthcare? Jay Saccaro : Sure. I would maybe take a step back and talk about we have a very active approach to managing the balance sheet. For us this idea of having a healthy investment grade balance sheet is really core to what we're trying to achieve. I think we've got a very good cash flowing business. And what that will allow us to do is, first, enhance the debt side of the balance sheet and then along the way continue with business development and then also evaluate other alternatives, things like dividend, which we have in place but also share buyback and so very active approach to managing the balance sheet. As it relates to the pension, we had a very large pension liability and for us we have an active approach there as well with respect to risk reduction. We froze a remaining portion of the US plan, which is effective beginning in 2025 and it doesn't really have a material impact on the size of the liability. The benefits are in 2025 and beyond there'll be lower service costs and lower projected cash contributions everything else being equal. So what it really does is it minimizes the range of outcomes with respect to the pension, eliminate some risk with respect to the pension versus creating a real economic windfall for us. So the savings will be in service costs over time and something that starts to show up in 2025 and beyond. Ryan Zimmerman : Great. Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Suraj Kalia : Good morning, Peter, Jay. Can you hear me all right? Peter Arduini : We can. Good morning. Suraj Kalia : Pardon the background noise. Gentlemen congrats on the quarter. So I'll post both my questions upfront. One for Jay and one for Peter. So, Jay I understand and appreciate the commentary about a robust demand and procedure backlogs. When I look at the risk mitigation, how should we think about the various buffers that GE has vis-\u00e0-vis all the geopolitical risks right now? That's the question for you Jay. And Peter forgive me maybe I misheard it. I thought I heard you say you are looking to have a strategic collaboration to get into therapeutics in peripheral disease maybe I misheard it was a type 2. And it just piqued my curiosity if now you're looking at potentially entering into some therapeutic segments. Gentlemen, congrats again and thanks for taking my questions. Peter Arduini : Yes, Suraj, thanks for your question. Maybe I'll take the first one and then Jay can talk a little bit about some of the broader demand procedures now we're looking at it. What I mentioned was actually for peripheral use of Ultrasound for therapy. So, I didn't mention actually going into other therapies. But we actually have had some research work that's been going on for some time on the use of peripheral ultrasound to actually help out with stimulation of different nerves, focus on the liver to actually be able to change the course of certain disease states. And so, this is very early, but it's collaboration we announced with Novo Nordisk, that will work together. And so this is what folks would categorize as bioelectric medicine and again peripheral focused ultrasound. If you're interested in it, there's actually been some articles most recently in 2021, there was a great article in Nature about how the products can actually help modulate inflammation stimulate the liver. But this is potentially an opportunity for a way of a non-pharmacological approach to actually help change disease courses, as well as working in conjunction with pharmacological solutions. So this is obviously a longer-term investment. But it's something actually that is actually funded in the near term with our partner and we'll work jointly on this. But this is a pretty exciting opportunity to leverage what we know and partner up with the world-class pharmaceutical company. Jay? Jay Saccaro : Yes, sure. As it relates to your first question, it's interesting, because if you think about 2023, we've had a highly volatile macroeconomic backdrop. And yet the sales for our company have been quite resilient and ahead of our original expectations, we originally expected 5% to 7%. We now expect 6% to 8%, again confronted with a very volatile macro backdrop that we've discussed today and we've discussed on previous calls. What it really comes down to is a few things that buffer us. Number one, is the backlog that we've discussed. At the end of the day, when customers put in orders they typically have a very acute need that they would like satisfied with products that we have. And so that backlog -- that $18-plus billion backlog has served us incredibly well. The second thing that we have in place is the fact that we have nearly half of our business or so is recurring revenue. And so things like PDx, things like our Service business, these are all things that we can count on reliably, again even despite a volatile macro backdrop. The final thing that I would say is, as we have this lean operating model in place, it's really about efficiency and managing costs effectively, such that you have a third layer of protection against a volatile macro situation. So, overall I think the business has fared quite well and the setup is good for 2024 as we look forward. I will leave it at that and maybe turn it over to Pete for some final comments. Peter Arduini : Great, Jay. So look well thanks everyone for joining us today. It's been 10 months in spend. It's amazing how fast time flies. We're successfully worked through a number of the macro challenges some we just talked about and our teams really delivered well on its commitments. We're looking forward to closing out the year and maintaining strong momentum as we approach 2024. We hope to see many of you and some of you if not soon at the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago, one of our biggest congresses at the end of November or one at the upcoming investor meetings we'll participate in. That ends the call. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Carolynne Borders, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead. Carolynne Borders : Thank you. Good morning and welcome to GE HealthCare\u2019s fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined by our President and CEO, Peter Arduini; and our Vice President and CFO, Jay Saccaro. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today\u2019s press release and in the presentation slides available on our website. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. And with that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Peter. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Carolynne. Let me start by providing a few highlights from a successful first year as a public company. I am proud of how our teams executed to deliver robust financial results with performance that all met or exceeded guidance. In fact, our execution throughout the year allowed us to raise guidance twice. We have continued to increase our R&D investment, launching over 40 new innovations tied to our care pathway and digital strategy. As a result of our investments, we estimate that we have gained global market share in equipment in 2023. And once again, we topped the FDA\u2019s list of AI-enabled device authorizations with 58, more than any other medtech company. Backlog remains robust led by an improved capital equipment landscape. And we significantly strengthened our balance sheet as we paid down $1 billion in debt since the beginning of the fourth quarter. Our financial flexibility enables us to drive both organic and inorganic investment such as the Caption Health and IMACTIS acquisitions completed in 2023. More recently, we announced our plans to acquire MIM Software, which I\u2019ll discuss in greater detail later in the call. We continue to build our position as a trusted partner. And here are a few highlights from throughout the year. On the commercial side, we secured multiyear enterprise deals globally with contract values totaling approximately $2.5 billion in 2023, fueling our growth. We also expanded our 4-year relationship with the University of Wisconsin-Madison by entering a 10-year strategic collaboration that goes beyond medical imaging to new frontiers and digital technologies and disease-focused solutions. Separately, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and BARDA, a division within the U.S. Department of Health and Services, are funding programs totaling over $80 million that will allow us to develop new AI applications for ultrasound, benefit patients in low and middle income countries and patients with lung pathologies and traumatic injuries. We also announced a collaboration with Novo Nordisk to advance the clinical and product development of peripheral-focused ultrasound. We\u2019ve assembled a strong world class leadership team. Jay Saccaro joined us last year and has had an immediate impact. He has had the opportunity to assess our organizational needs, forecasting models, financial systems and processes and is adding significant strategic and operational value. Similarly, Taha joined us as Chief Technology Officer more than a year ago. And he has been charting our digital future and strategy while building a high-performing team of top healthcare technology experts. In 2023, we published our inaugural sustainability report, highlighting our progress and commitment to corporate responsibility and risk management. Lastly, we introduced 2024 guidance today, which Jay will discuss in greater detail. Our outlook reflects an improved capital equipment landscape. It also reflects continued strength on top of 2 consecutive years of high single-digit organic sales growth. Similar to last quarter, we conducted a survey of a broad set of U.S. customers, which supports our forecast for 2024. Our latest survey showed improved financial optimism and capital budget outlook versus the last survey in October. Global procedures remain strong, which we believe all of this points to a constructive setup for the year. Now, I will pass the call on to Jay to take us through the financials and our business performance. And I\u2019ll conclude the call with a discussion around our R&D commitments and the innovation we are delivering for customers. Jay? Jay Saccaro : Thanks, Pete. Let\u2019s start with our financial performance on Slide 4. For the fourth quarter of 2023, revenues of $5.2 billion increased 5% year-over-year and grew 5% organically. This was driven by sales in Pharmaceutical Diagnostics, Imaging and Patient Care Solutions. Recall that this 5% organic growth was on top of the 13% we delivered in the fourth quarter of 2022, which benefited from easing supply chain. Organic orders increased 3% year-over-year. Order dollars continue to outpace sales, leading to a total company book-to-bill of 1.05x, up sequentially from 1.03x due to healthy product orders, including equipment. We exited the year with a record backlog of $19.1 billion, up $700 million sequentially. This performance gives us continued confidence in our expectations for 2024. Fourth quarter adjusted EBIT margin was 16.1%. Sequentially, margin improved 70 basis points, supported by seasonally higher volume while we expanded our investments in future innovation. Year-over-year, standalone adjusted EBIT margin was flat as benefits from productivity and price were offset primarily by investments. The lean methodology is at the foundation of our productivity, yielding strong performance in the fourth quarter with improvements in logistics, sourcing and services. Our teams came together to increase on-time delivery to our customers by 11% year-over-year with lean actions improving demand forecast accuracy, supplier planning and lead times. We also saw past-due backlog efficiency with a greater than 50% improvement year-over-year in Imaging alone. For the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.18, up 11% on a standalone basis. Free cash flow of $956 million was down slightly year-over-year. This was impacted by approximately $330 million of spin-related items, such as interest and post-retirement benefit payments. Turning to our full year results on Slide 5. For 2023, revenues of $19.6 billion grew 8% organically versus last year. All of our regions and segments saw positive revenue growth. Also important to note, recurring revenue, which drives revenue predictability and higher margin, was greater than 45% of total revenues for the year. Organic orders grew 3% year-over-year and book-to-bill was 1.03x. On a standalone basis, 2023 adjusted EBIT margin was up 60 basis points. Adjusted EPS of $3.93 exceeded our guidance and represented standalone growth of 16%. Free cash flow was more than $1.7 billion and translated into a strong conversion rate of 95%, which was ahead of our guidance for the year. This was driven by the solid progress we made in working capital associated with multiple initiatives focused on inventory and collections processes. On Slide 6, let\u2019s take a closer look at segment revenue performance for the year. For full year \u201823, we delivered strong year-over-year organic growth of 8% for revenues. This was led by PDx with 18% growth, PCS at 8% and Imaging at 7% driven by both volume and price. Ultrasound organic revenue increased 2%. Recall that in 2022, we had multiple quarters of strong Ultrasound results as supply chain constraints eased. I\u2019d also note that all segments delivered positive price in the year, reflecting our continued pricing discipline. Looking ahead, we believe all of our segments are well positioned as we move into 2024 from both an innovation and operational perspective. I\u2019ll walk through more details on this for each segment shortly. Turning to the progress we made in 2023 on margin initiatives on Slide 7. As we move through the year, we drove sequential improvements in adjusted EBIT margin driven by volume, commercial execution and productivity. For the year, we increased adjusted gross margin by 120 basis points versus 2022 and delivered more than 3% in positive sales price for the year, ahead of our expectations. In 2024, we expect 1 to 2 percentage points of positive price as we deliver increasing value to our customers. We are also starting to see margin expansion from improving volumes and higher margin NPIs given our continued R&D investment. For the year, we invested more than $1 billion in R&D, equating to over 6% of sales, all while expanding margins. In 2024, we expect to be in the same range as a percent of sales or slightly higher, supporting our innovative shin pipeline. Our productivity initiatives have also gained traction as logistics costs continue to improve, spot buys decrease. And as we implemented cost-efficient design changes, we have also experienced improved labor productivity driven by a greater proportion of remote fix and the application of digital tools. Relative to G&A, we are optimizing our spend by rightsizing our real estate footprint and IT infrastructure to generate additional efficiencies. We made solid progress in exiting TSAs in 2023 with nearly 280 completed through the end of 4Q. We are on track to exit the vast majority of the remaining TSAs in 2024, which gives us confidence in our G&A optimization plans, an important part of reaching medium-term margin goals. Given our progress across the organization, we have solid visibility to deliver on our high teens to 20% adjusted EBIT margin target over the medium term. Now I\u2019ll turn to our segments. As a reminder, in 2023, we incurred approximately $200 million of recurring standalone costs that impact our segment EBIT margin rates. We did not have these expenses in 2022. These costs were allocated based on revenue and equated to approximately 100 basis points of margin headwind for each segment. Going forward, these costs will be in our run-rate but serve as an opportunity to operate more efficiently in the future. Let\u2019s start with our Imaging segment on Slide 8, where we generated organic revenue growth of 4% year-over-year. This was driven by improved backlog conversion and price. Growth was up against fourth quarter sales that experienced a strong double-digit increase in 2022. Segment EBIT margin was up 10 basis points year-over-year as we made progress on enhancing gross margin. Imaging equipment growth outpaced service growth in the quarter and for the year, which impacted margin mix as we build our installed base with future service growth opportunity. We saw strong progress in our product platforming initiatives across several modalities, including CT and MR. Customer demand for our imaging product remains healthy and our growing backlog is driven by new product introductions. Turning to Ultrasound on Slide 9. Organic revenue was down 2% year-over-year due to the impact of lower volume tied to a challenging comparison for the same period last year. We continue to have a positive outlook for this segment as we enter 2024. Segment EBIT margin declined year-over-year due to investments such as the Caption Health artificial intelligence integration. This year-over-year margin decline was partially mitigated by cost productivity as we drove standardization and commonality across our platforms. As we exited the year, we saw opportunities for Ultrasound equipment based on a combination of our commercial efforts and improving market conditions. With recent customer commitments and interest in new products enhanced by AI technology, we are well positioned as we enter 2024. Moving to Patient Care Solutions on Slide 10. Organic revenue was up 4% driven by progress on price and operational process improvements. Revenue increased as we fulfill more backlog in addition to contribution from NPIs. Similar to Imaging, recall that sales growth in the fourth quarter last year increased double digits due to easing supply chain environment. PCS margin decreased 320 basis points compared to last year driven by investments and onetime favorability that we experienced in the prior year. During the quarter, the team delivered on improved supplier lead times and lower inventory. As we look ahead, we\u2019re excited about recent product launches that should contribute to future growth. Finally, moving to Pharmaceutical Diagnostics on Slide 11. We have another solid quarter, generating 23% year-over-year organic growth associated with an easier year-over-year comparison and pricing. Segment EBIT margin of 24.4% improved 140 basis points year-over-year driven by price, volume and productivity actions. We\u2019re encouraged by the continuing strength of global imaging procedures, which drives the need for imaging agents. We are executing on our innovation strategy through investments in our pipeline across care areas, including the in-licensing of FAPI assets, which we believe will play a key role in targeting this protein to detect certain types of cancer. This is an area of significant potential for the nuclear medicine and oncology communities. Turning to Slide 12, I\u2019ll walk through our cash flow performance. We exited the year with an improved financial profile, including a stronger balance sheet and enhanced financial flexibility to support our future growth. We generated free cash flow of $956 million during the fourth quarter, down $31 million year-over-year with standalone cash outflows. Inventory turns improved in the quarter, the highest they have been since the beginning of 2021. This is the result of our lean supply chain actions. We saw operational improvements, including lead time reductions and greater inventory turns in all segments. Our aged inventory balance decreased, and we have stronger input controls in place, including safety stock reduction and optimized stock planning. In addition, our collections improved as a result of our focused daily management system. For the year, we delivered strong free cash flow of over $1.7 billion. This equates to 95% free cash flow conversion. We also strengthened our balance sheet by paying down $1 billion of debt since the start of the fourth quarter. With a strong balance sheet and a balanced capital allocation strategy, we\u2019ll continue to focus on organic and inorganic investment, deleveraging and paying a dividend. Now let\u2019s turn to our outlook on Slide 13. For 2024, we expect organic revenue growth to be approximately 4%. This compares to strong growth of 8% in \u201823 that was driven by easing supply chains and price gains. I would note that we expect a foreign exchange headwind to revenue of less than 1% in 2024. We expect full year adjusted EBIT margin to be in the range of 15.6% to 15.9%, representing expansion of 50 to 80 basis points, given the progress we\u2019re making with volume, commercial execution and optimization. We assume an adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. The Pillar 2 global minimum tax is not anticipated to have a significant impact on our tax expense in 2024. On adjusted EPS, we expect to deliver between $4.20 and $4.35 for the full year, representing growth in the range of 7% to 11% versus 2023. Lastly, we expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion for the full year. While we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, it\u2019s important to note that given the seasonal nature of our business, the fourth quarter is typically the strongest period for orders, sales dollars and adjusted EBIT margin. We expect year-over-year organic revenue growth and adjusted EBIT margin in the first quarter to be the lowest of the year. Also remember that organic sales growth in the first half of 2023 was very strong at 11%. As a result, organic revenue growth is expected to be stronger in the second half of the year versus the first half in 2024. To wrap up, we\u2019re entering 2024 from a position of strength as we executed well in 2023. Our solid backlog, order intake and adjusted EBIT margin progress gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on our guidance for 2024. Now I\u2019ll hand the call back over to Pete. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Jay. Through an emphasis on R&D, we continue to innovate across our four segments. Our new product vitality index, which measures new products contributing to orders in the year, was healthy at 26%. We launched more than 40 new innovations in 2023 as I noted before, many of which are AI and digitally enabled, bringing more opportunity to increase gross margin with these enhanced capabilities. Earlier, I mentioned our plans to acquire MIM Software, a leader in AI-enabled image analysis and workflow tools across multiple care areas. Once integrated post close, MIM is expected to drive accretive top line growth. And we expect the transaction to be neutral to adjusted EBIT in year 1 and accretive thereafter. One of the dilemmas our customers face is integrating the variety of multi-vendor AI applications into their workflows. Our new App Orchestrator is a solution that simplifies the AI selection, integration and workflow process for healthcare professionals. By providing easy access to prevalidated apps, we\u2019re helping reduce the pressure that often comes with the overhead of evaluating, acquiring and implementing solutions from many companies. We\u2019re in the process of developing the subscription-based application for the cloud. Our high-growth, high-margin AI solutions are designed to increase productivity, efficiency and diagnostic confidence. Customers have the option to purchase new AI-equipped devices or as an upgrade to existing equipment. We\u2019re actively pursuing AI across our product portfolio with a focused effort to expedite product development in 2024. Moving to molecular imaging on Slide 15 and the role of MIM Software to enhance our precision care strategy. For starters, our unique portfolio of PET/MR, PET/CT and multi-head SPECT/CT, radio tracers and digital offers providers a comprehensive solution to deliver on this growing field of diagnostics and therapeutics. As novel therapies become more widely available, our tracers play an increasingly important role, putting us at the center of this transformation of care that will help enable better patient outcomes across many care pathways as functional imaging expands. This chart illustrates the diversity of our pharmaceutical portfolio, both existing and in the pipeline, and the diseases that each one uniquely targets. We see growth opportunities with our existing products like Vizamyl for patients with suspected Alzheimer\u2019s disease as new therapies ramp up and Cerianna for metastatic breast cancer, which are used both in conjunction with PET systems for diagnosis. Flurpiridaz, a pipeline product for diagnosing and assessing coronary artery disease, is expected to significantly advance PET/CT imaging. Cardiologists say it shows promise for a variety of reasons. First, it has the potential to offer more sensitivity and specificity than SPECT and technetium, which is the standard of care. Its longer half-life may allow doses to be ordered and transported longer distances unlike other products on the market, which require on-site production which can be a limiting factor for smaller hospitals and cardiac imaging centers. One of the most exciting advancements in molecular and functional imaging is Theranostics. There is a motto for this rapidly growing field that allows you to see what you treat and treat what you see. Theranostics combines diagnostic imaging equipment, radiopharmaceuticals, both diagnostics and therapeutic, with the goal of eliminating cancer cells without affecting healthy tissues. And this has fewer side effects for patients. This approach can bring significant improvements for many cancer types and one of the reasons why molecular imaging has a very promising future. To give you some perspective, currently, the overall Theranostics market, which includes equipment, tracers and therapies, is approximately $9 billion and is expected to grow to $40 billion by 2032. Today, Theranostics is primarily used in thyroid, neuroendocrine and prostate cancer. However, a growing pipeline of drugs across the industry for future applications include breast, ovarian, pancreatic and lung cancers show even more promise to potentially extend the length and quality of life for more patients. We expect to play an important role in the delivery of these new therapies. In the next 3 years, we plan to significantly increase our current Theranostics franchise through a combination of organic and inorganic expansions. And we\u2019re excited about the opportunity to be a trusted partner, helping our customers navigate this important and growing field of medical imaging. This mission to improve outcomes across care pathways will be enabled by our announced intention to acquire MIM. After close, we plan to integrate these new capabilities into GE HealthCare\u2019s devices to enhance imaging fusion, multimodal inputs for diagnostics, therapy planning and monitoring. And by leveraging these new tools across various care areas, we can differentiate our solutions for the benefit of patients and healthcare systems worldwide, particularly around Theranostics. In closing, we\u2019re excited about the growth potential of molecular imaging and Theranostics as well as our pipeline pharmaceuticals and the collective opportunity for these innovations to enable precision care. To summarize on Slide 16, I\u2019m extremely proud of our team\u2019s execution in 2023 and our focus on patients and customers as well as the progress we\u2019ve made as a standalone company. We achieved or exceeded our financial and operational objectives we laid out at the beginning of the year. And we\u2019re making significant progress on the innovation front, including digital and artificial intelligence launches. We have a strong balance sheet that allows us to invest in new capabilities organically and inorganically. And we\u2019re excited about our momentum as we enter 2024. We remain on track to deliver on our medium-term targets. With that, I\u2019d like to open up the call for questions. Carolynne Borders : Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can you please open the line? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And that will come from the line of Craig Bijou with Bank of America. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Good morning, Craig. Craig Bijou : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So Jay, appreciate the comments on Q1. And I did want to dive a little bit deeper there. Can you guys still grow revenues in Q1, given that you do have a pretty strong year-over-year comp? And then on the margin side, should we still expect margin expansion in Q1, but maybe it\u2019s at a rate a little bit lower than what you\u2019re expecting for the full year? Jay Saccaro : Craig, that\u2019s right. Overall, as I said in my prepared remarks, the first half will be lower than the second half. And the first quarter will be lower than the second quarter. And really what this comes down to is the challenging comp that we saw in Q1 of last year. I believe we had 12% revenue growth, which was really a great performance in that quarter. Having said that, we still expect revenue growth in the first quarter and some level of margin expansion, albeit both of those lower than the full year rates. Craig Bijou : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, I did want to touch on China and the Anti-Corruption Act. And basically, I want to get your sense for what\u2019s going on there? And did you grow sales and orders in China in Q4? And how should we think about that in the early parts of \u201824? Peter Arduini : Hey, Craig, it\u2019s Pete. Well, look, as you know, there is a lot of moving parts within China. We\u2019ve talked a lot about this in the past. I think there is three things. I mean there is clearly a focus by the government to expand capabilities in medical coverage. And a lot of that comes down to our equipment, ultrasound CT as a first part. The second thing is there was a stimulus funding from last year, which was in Q4 and affected in Q1, where we did actually very, very well from a share and a growth standpoint. And then we have anti-corruption. What we\u2019ve seen on the ground is it\u2019s not that consistent in many different ways, meaning that certain provinces, there may be less. In fact, other provinces there may be more. I think that\u2019s going to play out and throughout the coming year. We believe overall that the approach to drive better compliance in a very large country is a good thing and that there isn\u2019t necessarily an end date as much as it\u2019s a new policy approach about how you do business. And for a company like us, it\u2019s kind of how we do business every country around the world. I think that lays it out that way. That being said, last year for us in China in the first half, we had a very strong first half. We grew over 20% organic in the first half of 2023. So we\u2019re actually expecting our growth to be negative year-over-year. That\u2019s contemplated in our guidance in the first half and then in the second half, resuming to growth. And so that\u2019s kind of how we profiled it, and that\u2019s part of our 4% guidance that we\u2019ve laid out. Longer-term, we believe China, again, with 1.4 billion people, 400 million getting quality services today and 1 billion that need it is going to continue to be a growth market out into the future. But we\u2019ve taken, I think, a prudent approach on how we take a look at no growth in the first half and then growth resuming in the second half. Craig Bijou : Thanks, guys. Peter Arduini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And that will come from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Hi, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Hi, Pete. Congrats on a nice [indiscernible]. Very good morning to you. My first, high level on the guidance here, Pete. 4% organic seems reasonable, given the tougher comps. Curious what is the guide assuming for pricing? And the book-to-bill in Q4, 1.06, it kind of implies that capital book for bill was perhaps 1.08, 1.09. What is the relationship between \u2013 when I look at those optical numbers of 1.08, 1.09 capital versus revenues, right? Is there a timing element? Could perhaps 4% \u2013 just looking at the book-to-bill, the 4% seems, it looks like it has some cushion. Jay Saccaro : So maybe I\u2019ll talk first about the sales growth for the year and then talk a little bit about pricing because I think both of those were embedded in the question. Listen, we were very pleased with the performance to close out 2023. On a full year basis, we delivered 8% at the high end of the range, in fact, a little bit in excess of our expectations for the fourth quarter. And a lot of that came down to execution in terms of translating backlog into sales, which was a testament to all the work in many of our teams. And so as we look at 2024, we think roughly 4% is a solid number. If we think about it, we feel really good about 2023. We think the setup is solid. We think the business has proven it\u2019s pretty durable amidst a lot of macroeconomic volatility in 2023. Our business performed pretty well. And so as a result, we did put on some incremental orders in the fourth quarter in the last couple of months of 2023, which was ahead of our expectations. So as I said. And so it\u2019s early in the year. There is a lot of macro dynamics in play. Pete talked about one, but frankly, it\u2019s a volatile world that we\u2019re living in. And we set the 4% up. It\u2019s a really challenging comp, but it\u2019s set out with a very solid backlog, a solid book-to-bill ratio. And so hopefully, things cooperate and we move through the year nicely. Pete, why don\u2019t you add to that and then we can talk about price? Peter Arduini : Yes. No, I would just \u2013 I think you covered it, Jay, other than the fact to say that, look, we were super pleased with the order book performance. There is been obviously a reasonable amount of questions over this year about order and the translation to revenue, putting up strong orders growth in the fourth quarter, both service and equipment. And again, when you think about our orders book now being over $19 billion, that obviously sets us up for more gas in the tank in \u2013 later in Q \u2013 in the second half of 2024. But it\u2019s also a business that we have for multiyear deals that gives us visibility into \u201825 as well. And I think that\u2019s an important aspect here. I mentioned $2.5 billion of multiyear enterprise deals, which we\u2019ve been really ramping up our capability on. Not only does that help you in the current year, but it typically gives you 2 to 3 years\u2019 visibility out of business that you\u2019re going to get that you don\u2019t need to win each year. And I think \u2013 so for over the period of time here, I just feel very good. And again, I\u2019m just very satisfied with the work that the team has done and the setup that we\u2019ve had. And to Jay\u2019s point, we tried to take into consideration all the different challenges that may be helping in the world and making sure that we\u2019ve had the appropriate call to be able to deal with whatever parameters come our way. Jay Saccaro : Vijay, as it relates to price, like I said, we were pleased with price in \u201823. We delivered around 3% of price. And a lot of that comes down to a cultural focus at our company in terms of selling value and appreciation of our customers of the value that we\u2019re bringing to the table. We are trying to innovate. You saw the R&D growth number in the quarter. We really are trying to accelerate innovation, and that translates to new and unique products. And so from our standpoint, that\u2019s unlocked a lot of our pricing opportunity. What we expect, consistent with the midterm plans that we\u2019ve laid out, is roughly 1% to 2% pricing in 2024, and we will continue that going forward. So I think this is about culture. It\u2019s about new products, and that\u2019s what\u2019s really \u2013 and discipline in terms of how you construct your deals. That\u2019s really what\u2019s enabled this. Peter Arduini : And I\u2019d just support that by, again, obviously, new products aren\u2019t in the price calculation. They are in mix. But with a focus on having those come out at higher gross margins. When you have a vitality index of 26%, over 25% of your products are coming out that have a higher gross margin than the predicate ones. And ultimately, that will be the dynamic even more so than like-for-like products, which will help drive margin. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s extremely helpful, Pete. And one quick follow-up here. The margin expansion guide was really impressive, 50 to 80 basis points. How much of that is coming from gross margins versus operating leverage? Jay Saccaro : Sure. And just a word on 2023 margin. We expanded 60 basis points standalone, but we did that with a dramatic increase in R&D expansion. And so that\u2019s the template that we really, really like to see. And so as we look at 2024, the vast majority of the expansion will come from gross margin. I used some words in my prepared remarks regarding the lean focus at the company, and that\u2019s real. What we call variable cost productivity initiatives are reshaping how we operate the manufacturing and distribution operations of the company. So that\u2019s one key element. Pricing is another key element impacting gross margin. So in 2024, majority comes from gross margin expansion. You\u2019ll actually see R&D grow as a percentage of sales, not to the extent that it did in prior years, but it will increase as a percentage of sales as we continue to grow R&D faster. And then there will be a little bit of savings from SG&A. That\u2019s really the construct behind the 50 to 80 basis points. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. Thanks, guys. Peter Arduini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And that will come from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Good morning, Matt. Matt Taylor : Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. So I had a follow-up. You talked a little bit about the phasing with China. And I guess I was wondering if you could comment also on other geographies and how that phase through the year, is that growth expected to be more linear in the 4% assumption? And then the other part of that question is you mentioned the customer survey that you did recently. You thought was a little bit more positive. I was wondering if you could unpack that a little bit and talk about how much that went into your forecast. Peter Arduini : Jay? Jay Saccaro : Sure. Peter Arduini : You want to take the first part and I\u2019ll take... Jay Saccaro : Yes, I think that \u2013 I think China is \u2013 listen, China is not a huge piece of our business, right? It\u2019s about 15% overall. And so the dynamic that Pete described is one that we\u2019re working through, and I think presents a nice opportunity for the second half of the year and beyond. As far as other geographies go, they do generally follow some of the same patterns that we \u2013 that I described as a company overall. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 and really, it\u2019s not about health of market or buying decision time frames, but rather it\u2019s about the comparators that we\u2019re dealing with. Q1, Q2, you\u2019re talking about a blended 10% ish revenue growth. Q3, Q4, a little bit more normal. So really, it comes down to that in terms of why the growth is going to be the way it is for us in 2024. I wouldn\u2019t point to other geographic factors other than that comp. Now as it relates to the hospital capital surveys, overall, we survey each quarter. And we go to our main customers. We talk to them. We have discussions in an organized manner using the specific tool that we have in place. And what we said in the third quarter is we were seeing some signs of optimism from that group. And then as we did our most recent survey, I would actually point to a couple of different things. First, we did see increased buying and ordering patterns in the fourth quarter of the year. As we closed out in particular, in December, there was a buoyancy to the markets, in particular, the U.S. market that sort of supported some of the things that we saw in the survey. The second thing is our internal surveys continued in terms of commentary on positive expectations for growth in 2024 and which I think that was a great piece of data as well. And then third, as we looked at general external information, there were a few things that came our way. First of all, hospital profitability is robust. We saw good reports from a number of providers, a number of indices, which report on general hospital health. All of those things were good. Second, sentiment surveys that other people conducted were also \u2013 we use words like constructive setup into 2024. We are not sitting here saying it\u2019s going to be an unbelievable market. But we think it\u2019s going to be a solid market as we approach 2024. Of course, we are watching Fed rate decisions because that will have another element as people look at installing capital and making ultrasound purchases. But by and large, we feel good about how we are thinking about 2024. Pete, do you want to add anything in terms of customer discussions? Peter Arduini : I think you covered it. I mean the only point, look, the balance sheets are getting better, Matt, less travelers, nursing and stuff. So, their costs are going down. And so you have seen in some of the reports, profit going up, which is what we are hearing, so that\u2019s there. At the same time, demand is strong, meaning the procedures of patients coming in, either from orthopedic, cardiovascular, neuro, I mean across the board. And so as you have heard us say as well as others, the more that those procedures grow and new innovations come out, they typically are always supported by much of the equipment that we do. We talk about Alzheimer\u2019s when \u2013 new therapies are going to come out. And as they do grow, they are going to require our equipment to image and manage safety. As new implants come out in orthopedics and move to an outpatient center, you are going to need an OECC arm to be able to do that procedure backed up with ultrasound. So, that\u2019s the part that we watch is that customers\u2019 health, particularly in the United States is improving and the procedures growth is on the rise. Matt Taylor : Thanks Pete. Thanks Jay. Peter Arduini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Hi Larry. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Hey. Good morning Pete. Good morning Jay. Thanks for taking the question. I am going to ask two pipeline questions. First, Pete, the slide say, you filed Flurpiridaz. You talked about it in your prepared remarks. Are you expecting approval in 2024? And there are about 9 million myocardial perfusion imaging tests in the U.S. each year, do you think Flurpiridaz can capture a significant portion of the NPI market over time? And I have one follow-up. Peter Arduini : Yes. Larry, look, we are \u2013 I won\u2019t give my estimate of when the agency approvals would be. But the normative rates would say at some point here in the later second half of the year based on what the normal dates would be for an NDA that we should be in the process for an approval. Look, it\u2019s a very exciting drug. And I mean you know, you have written on it as well. The standard of care forever, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is a SPECT camera and technetium. Many of us here, I think on the call listening in know if you go to any type of hospital [Technical Difficulty] test to see how your heart is functioning, which then directly translates into how is the pumping [ph], or your vessels doing, and how is the electrical system doing, and it\u2019s a very efficient test. The challenge is the current products just actually don\u2019t have the level of specificity or sensitivity, meaning that they can\u2019t always point to a direct interventional action. And the early data, again, to be substantiated with the right approval is that a product like Flurpiridaz can greatly increase the specificity and sensitivity. To your point, it\u2019s not a product that\u2019s used on a SPECT camera. It\u2019s a product that\u2019s used on PET/CT. PET/CT is not widely used in cardiology. If this product were to take off and capture a larger percentage of it, which we believe over time will be the case, it\u2019s going to acquire more PET/CT systems in cardiology or in cooperation with radiology. And so we are quite excited about. I think it\u2019s a great support for cardiovascular care. I know cardiologists have looked at, have been very impressed with it. But we will see how that plays out. We are not counting on any significant ramp right now in our mid-term views. We have, I would say, a reasonable numbers that in some future date post approval, we will talk about. But to your point, with the size of the opportunity, there could be some scenarios where this could end up being a larger piece of the business over time. Larry Biegelsen : That\u2019s very helpful. And Pete, I would love to get an update on your progress with the photon counting CT technology. What are the next steps and milestones in the process to bring this to the market in the U.S. and outside the U.S.? Thank you. Peter Arduini : Yes. Larry thanks. Yes, photon counting, obviously, very exciting technology for CT, really probably the biggest transformation to come to CT in the last 30-some years beyond multi-slice. And it has that opportunity to bring better resolution, reduce dose, but also bring functional capabilities within the CT world, which typically is a great anatomical imager, but doesn\u2019t show what\u2019s happening more to cellular or an organ level. And photon has that capability. There is obviously some other players in the marketplace currently. We have beta sites that are actually running where we are actually doing a lot of work currently. We believe our technology approach, which is the use of a deep silicone is unique in a lot of different ways. But I would just say for the whole broader sector, all of us that are playing in it, I think this is going to be a strong revolution for the whole industry mainly because CT\u2019s ability to be installed in many different places and it\u2019s just ubiquitous use for so many different diagnoses. So, stand by, more to come, we will be talking more about it throughout the year, but we are making good progress on the platform. So, thanks for the question. Larry Biegelsen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And that will come from the line of Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Good morning Joanne. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. As you move more and more into AI-enabled technology, could you comment on your thoughts and how to translate that to dollars and plans. Is it a subscription model, is it Software-as-a-Service, how do we think about that? Peter Arduini : Yes, Joanne, it\u2019s a great question. And I would say our strategies are evolving. And it will be, in many ways, multi-facet. So, just to give an example, in today\u2019s world, where we have a product like AIR Recon DL, which again is this new way of actually how an MRI actually creates an imaging using artificial intelligence and the corresponding upgrades that we can take to our installed base. Today, those fundamentally result in a higher price value proposition, higher gross margins for an acquisition in that space. And I think there is still going to be plenty of those opportunities to say this product by itself and this product plus AI is actually 4 points, 5 points, 10 points higher in gross margin because of what it actually does. And that will still account for a reasonable part of our growth. The second part then is actually bringing certain capabilities via a SaaS model as their pure standalone software capability. So, take in my prepared remarks, I talked about the App Orchestrator. There is a great example of a product that will be cloud-based, can fit on many different pack systems and work with multi-vendor equipment. And customers may decide that at one hospital or their whole network, they want it. And so they could pay for one on-site capability of SaaS, they could pay for multiple. And then riding upon that will be applications from other third-parties. And we will have an opportunity to say, you will get 70%, we will take 30% as an enabler into our broader installed base in others. And so there is a multifaceted way. I would say in 2024, one of our big operating priorities or big priorities we have is really building out this go-to-market and monetization model. But it\u2019s going to evolve everything from more value to a piece of hardware, which we can actually attain more value for all the way through different \u2013 almost down to buy the use capabilities. That \u2013 again, that\u2019s going to expand over multiple years, but that\u2019s how we are thinking about it and putting in place the right type of SaaS backbone for the whole company. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Graham Doyle with UBS. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Hi Graham. Graham Doyle : Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Can we just touch on China again, just to clarify one of the statements earlier? You said you are expecting no growth, but also negative growth in the first half. And just is it negative or no growth, i.e., flat? And just for the full year, are you expecting China to grow? And then just a quick clarification one after that on the order book. Thank you. Jay Saccaro : Sure. On China, we expect a decline in the first half. But remember, in Q1 of 2023 and Q2 of 2023, we had around 20% growth. So, we have always kind of modeled the decline in the first half, growth in the second half. And as a result, we are expecting growth for the year. Graham Doyle : Perfect. That\u2019s super clear. And then just on the orders, I think you mentioned quite a sizable multiyear contract win. Does that get all booked in the Q4 \u201823 as well then? Peter Arduini : Yes. Graham, what I actually, I think referenced was over the year, multiple enterprise deals that we won that amount to over $2.5 billion. Our current process is as we bring in significant amounts of orders, we typically don\u2019t book out beyond a 2-year window of our orders. So, we have something that\u2019s captured for 5 years, 6 years, 10 years. We aren\u2019t actually booking years seven \u2013 excuse me, 3 years and beyond in our current order book. That\u2019s not our approach that we implement. So, the order we put in the 3% growth are very near-term orders that we won in the fourth quarter that will see play out in \u201824 and in \u201825. Graham Doyle : Perfect. And really quick one on that and photon came to you \u2013 you brought up earlier. Is it your expectation that on \u2013 I don\u2019t know, like call it, a 5-year view, this becomes kind of the standard of care within CT more broadly as it becomes economic, and we should expect that this \u2013 most CTs in Europe and certainly the U.S. become photon counting? Peter Arduini : I think 5 years is a little bit optimistic. I mean I think I have heard what others have said as well. I think in the 10-year window, that\u2019s probably more realistic. Keep in mind, 85% of all CTs in the world tend to be more mid-tier value-based products. Some of them sell for $200,000, $300,000 in different parts of the world. So, it\u2019s a wide community of what\u2019s in a CT. To your point is on the premium end and stuff, I think in the 5-year window, yes, you are going to see a significant higher percentage of photon counting. Graham Doyle : Perfect. Thank you very much guys. I will jump in the queue. Peter Arduini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Anthony Petrone with Mizuho. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Good morning Anthony. Anthony Petrone : Good morning Pete. How are you? Good morning Jay. Congrats on a solid year and your post-spin. Maybe I will start, Pete, with just a question on Theranostics. You have it in the slide deck here. Obviously, GE HealthCare, well positioned on the diagnostics side. You mentioned growth organically and inorganically. Just wondering how you are thinking about the other pieces of Theranostics. You have therapeutics and supply chain. You can grow more in diagnostics. So, just maybe your thoughts on how that space is consolidating and where GE can play specifically? And I will have a follow-up for Jay on capital allocation. Peter Arduini : Yes. No, it\u2019s a good question. I mean obviously, at the baseline level, as these therapies take off, PET/CT is a critical product. I mean for all practical purposes, it\u2019s a limited world of folks that manufacture a PET/CT and PET/MR. We are one of them. We think to do this effectively, you have to have a multi-head SPECT/CT. We have a 12-head system called the StarGuide. None of our major competitors really have that product. Why is that important, if you have a traditional two-head, it\u2019s an hour to do the study versus you can do it in 15 minutes or less. You can\u2019t run an effective Theranostics department if you don\u2019t have a multi-head camera. So, that\u2019s kind of a stick [ph]. The next thing is you need to integrate those images and look at them together to diagnose, look at radiation dose. Patient might have had external beam radiation. They get radiation from the drug itself. You need to look at both of those. MIM Software is really the best in the world. They are going to be part of us post close. That\u2019s going to bring a missing link. It\u2019s also a capability that really nobody else in the industry has when you couple that with those products. And then on the tracer side, we are the only company who has the equipment and manufacturers of tracers. Others distribute, but there is a big difference between just shipping it around and making it. And so we have the logistics capability. We also have the manufacturing capability. And we also make the cyclotrons, which, again, are particle accelerators that actually help create many of these. So, there is multiple opportunities here either working with some of the pharmaceutical companies directly, playing a leadership role with customers on how you deliver these doses. And I just remind everybody, unlike other drugs where you can just deliver in any center, these products have a half-life, which means the moment you make them, they are degrading. And so how you actually take an order and get it to a patient that day for the right potency is one of the things we have expertise in. So, again, as these grow and what we are excited about is the impact they are going to have on patients, effectiveness and low side effects. We have got most of the capabilities to play different roles throughout the growth of this and that\u2019s what we are planning to do. Anthony Petrone : Helpful. And Jay, real quick on capital allocation, uses of cash for this year. Is M&A more of the priority? You did $1 billion debt pay down and then just free cash flow conversion, that would be helpful. Thanks. Jay Saccaro : Sure. Thanks for the question. I think 2023 was really a great case study in terms of how we think about capital allocation. It starts, to your point, with free cash flow. We were able to deliver 95% conversion, which we were very proud of. We did a lot of work on the balance sheet on working capital balances and collections on inventory turns, which I commented on in my prepared remarks. And the result was we exceeded our cash flow expectations by a good margin. And we set up 2024 with another solid 90% conversion rate and free cash flow growth. And so then the question is, how do you deploy that, well, in 2023, the first thing we like to do is reinvest in the business to accelerate growth. And so what we were able to do is drive EBIT expansion of 60 basis points despite 20%-ish growth in R&D. And we also significantly expanded CapEx investments. So, point one, reinvest in the business. The second thing we like to do is strategic M&A. Over the course of 2023, we announced three deals, IMACTIS, Caption and MIM. All of them have the profile of deals that we like, strategically relevant, accretive to our business, really solid ROIs over time. And so all of them hit the profile and made us a bit more competitive in the marketplace with more offerings for our customers. Also in 2023, we made a number of minority investments that allow us to learn about new areas in a sort of experimental manner. So, we don\u2019t talk too much about all of those investments, but we make quite a few in 2023. And over time, we expect these to yield dividends. We also like to focus on the balance sheet, so we paid down $1 billion in debt in 2023, significantly enhancing the financial flexibility going forward. And finally, we paid a dividend. So, I guess the way I think about it, everything was on display in 2023 in terms of how we think about a disciplined capital allocation strategy. And as we move forward, I would expect to see more of the same. All of that, though, as I have said at the beginning of this was \u2013 is unlocked by cash flow generation, which is a real area of focus for us. Anthony Petrone : Thank you very much. Jay Saccaro : Thanks Anthony. Operator : Thank you. We do have time for one final question, and that will come from the line of Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Peter Arduini : Hi Patrick. Thank you. Patrick Wood : Hey. I will keep it to one, just given the timing. I will make it a short one. Thank you for the detail on the pricing side. Just kind of curious like how that\u2019s flowing through on the service book. Obviously, you get the 1-year warranty, but where you are re-signing service agreements, are you seeing a similar kind of price uplift to what you are getting on the hardware side so that, that traditional ratio between the two is remaining relatively constant? Just curious what you are seeing there. Thanks. Peter Arduini : Patrick, we have benefited from multiyear contracts, been able to actually have escalators on not only just on upfront, but then actually have escalators through the years. And then also, we have parts, significant large parts business as well as time and material. And then the other aspect of it is different services that we offer. It might be asset tracking tools, things of that nature. But I would say we have had the good fortune across the board to be able to get some price across all those different vehicles in service. I would say the other thing, and it\u2019s kind of a given point, but it\u2019s important to note that when services are really one of our highest margin offerings that we have. When you are gaining share, as I mentioned earlier on the call, ultimately, to your point, when you get to month 13, that becomes a service contract. And that higher mix of service over time also is an important driver of our future business. Thanks for that question. Patrick Wood : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And Mr. Arduini, I will turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks. Peter Arduini : Thank you. Thank you. Look, I would just like to close by saying thank you so much to our colleagues here at GE HealthCare. It\u2019s been a great year. There has been a lot of great work and tireless efforts to go into the first year as a public company. But importantly, with all of that, the focus on our patients and customers to deliver safe, high-quality products that make a difference. It\u2019s at the core of our lean mindset is customers first. We delivered on all of our commitments that we set to deliver in 2023 and as Jay and as we spoke about, really sets us up well for 2024. Investments we made in R&D are coming out. We have a full pipeline of new products and new clinical indications. With that, I would just like to say thank you for joining the call today. And we look forward to connecting with you at one of our upcoming conferences. Thank you so much. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s program. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference may be recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your speaker host, Carolynne Borders, Chief Investor Relations Officer. Please go ahead. Carolynne Borders : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to GE Healthcare's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I'm joined by our President and CEO, Peter Arduini; and our Vice President and CFO, Jay Saccaro. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's press release and in the presentation slides available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.  And with that, I'll hand the call over to Peter. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Carolynne, and thanks to all those joining us today. We've made good progress against our key priorities for 2024. In the first quarter, we delivered margin expansion while continuing to invest in innovation to help solve the evolving needs of customers and patients. Healthy backlog, orders growth and positive book-to-bill position us for accelerated growth for the rest of the year. Today, we reaffirmed our 2024 guidance, which Jay will discuss in greater detail. Now I'd like to highlight some milestones that illustrate our commercial execution. We're making steady progress with large multiyear multi-modality deals across equipment and service, resulting in incremental share gains. In the U.S., we secured a 10-year strategic alliance with OSF HealthCare to deliver technology, digital solutions and equipment management services to help clinicians improve care delivery and patient outcomes. We also extended our relationship with Hartford HealthCare to run through 2030. As a trusted partner, we'll continue to work together to optimize their imaging fleet and provide specialized support from our GE Healthcare service technicians. Our care pathway strategy is progressing well, enabling commercial growth opportunities and introducing us to adjacent markets with attractive growth potential. For example, last week, we announced the expansion of our collaboration with Elekta to enhance their radiation therapy planning offerings using MIM Software, which we acquired in April. In Spain, we announced the first global install of our Allia IGS Pulse system, which is our market-leading cathlab design that we expect will be a growth vehicle in this important interventional cardiology market. As we look to 2024, we see a growing funnel of opportunities for products like our IGS portfolio. Our strategic initiatives and trusted partnerships are taking hold and position us well for a future where health care is more connected, efficient and patient-centric. Looking ahead, our outlook reflects a strong global procedure environment, particularly in the United States, and customers continue to be optimistic about capital investment and market normalization. These tailwinds, combined with our focus on execution, give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitments for 2024 and our medium-term goals. Now I'll pass it on to Jay who will take us through the details of our first quarter performance. Jay? 1839991191. James Saccaro : Thanks, Pete. Let's start with our financial performance on Slide 4. For the first quarter of 2024, revenues of $4.6 billion were approximately flat organically year-over-year. Recall, this quarter's results followed the strong double-digit growth we delivered in the first quarter of 2023, which benefited from easing supply chain conditions and strong China stimulus sales. Organic orders increased 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in the U.S., with orders dollars continuing to outpace sales, we generated a solid total company book-to-bill of 1.03x versus 1.01x last year. We also exited the first quarter with a healthy backlog of $18.7 billion. Adjusted EBIT margin was 14.7%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, with improvements in both gross profit margin and SG&A. First quarter adjusted EPS was $0.90, up 6% year-over-year, driven by improved margins and lower interest expense. And we generated $274 million in free cash flow from improved working capital. On Slide 5, let's take a closer look at total company revenue performance for the first quarter. Organic revenue growth was approximately flat versus the 12% that we generated in the same period last year. On a reported basis, service grew 2% and product revenue declined 3%. Product performance was impacted by the difficult year-over-year comparison. Longer term, we see good growth opportunities in both product and service, including greater service revenue from a larger installed base. China revenue declined low double digits given the stimulus that benefited the first quarter of 2023 as well as anticorruption impact in the quarter. EMEA sales were up slightly and sales in the U.S. and rest of world were flat with prior year results. Turning to Slide 6 and the progress we made in the first quarter on margin initiatives. Adjusted gross margin expanded 120 basis points as we benefited from commercial wins and productivity initiatives. We also delivered positive price in the quarter. Productivity is an ongoing focus for our teams and our lean practices continue to drive improvements. Our teams are expanding daily management and standard work to new areas while delivering on current commitments. All of our segments delivered mid-single digit or greater variable cost productivity and made significant platforming improvements. We've been making strategic investments in advanced manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing and Additive, across our segments to enhance product capabilities and quality and improve variable cost productivity. To date in the U.S., we have more 3D printing-related patents than any other imaging company with [ 51 ]. These investments drive lower cost and higher durability. For example, in MR, we're applying these methodologies across the entire portfolio, saving us more than $1 million a year and improving performance and reliability. On SG&A, we continue to make progress with roughly 330 TSAs exited since spin, and we're well positioned to exit the vast majority of the remaining agreements this year. This will allow us to further optimize our cost structure in the future. We delivered solid progress in gross margin and adjusted EBIT margin expansion while continuing to fund strategic priorities for future growth. Now I'll turn to our segments. Let's start with Imaging on Slide 7, where we had approximately flat organic revenue growth. This was against a difficult comparison to the prior year when sales were up 12%. Segment EBIT margin was up 210 basis points year-over-year. We made progress on enhancing gross margin through productivity, price and service contract capture rate while investing in R&D. Margin expansion in this business remains a critical priority for us, and we're on track to the plans we communicated at our Investor Day. Customer demand for our Imaging products remains healthy as new therapies drive the need for Precision Imaging guidance. We're excited about the impact our new product introductions are expected to have on both future revenue and margin. Turning to Ultrasound on Slide 8. Organic revenue was down 4% year-over-year, following double-digit growth in the prior year. Segment EBIT margin decreased 200 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by inflation and lower volume. During the quarter, the team's strong focus on productivity through standardization and commonality across platforms, along with ongoing pricing strategies helped to partially offset these challenges. Looking ahead. Our funnel is solid, and we expect growth to accelerate as well as productivity initiatives to drive margin improvements in the second half of the year. Most notably, we also recently launched several exciting new ultrasound innovations that will benefit both top and bottom line performance. Moving to Patient Care Solutions on Slide 9. Organic revenue was down 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by in-quarter fulfillment delays and prior year COVID-related ventilator volume in China, which drove double-digit growth last year. Backlog remains healthy, which positions us well for growth. Segment EBIT margin decreased 310 basis points year-over-year, due to inflation and timing of shipments. We implemented programs to drive productivity and price that we expect will improve our margin in future quarters. Moving to Pharmaceutical Diagnostics on Slide 10. We had another strong quarter generating 8% year-over-year organic growth, driven by price and continued volume growth. In the quarter, we saw encouraging progress with the first signs of sales uptick from Vizamyl in the U.S. and other countries. With additional Alzheimer's therapy approvals, we expect more substantial increases in the second half of 2024. Segment EBIT margin of nearly 30% improved 190 basis points year-over-year, mostly driven by price, productivity actions and volume while we continue to invest in our robust R&D pipeline. We're also encouraged by the continued strength of global procedures, which drives the need for our Imaging agents. We're executing on significant capacity investments to strengthen the security of supply for our customers and to deliver on our patients' needs. Planned expansion at our Lindesnes facility in Norway is expected to be completed during the second quarter. At the same time, our lean methodology is foundational to delivering for our customers as we continue to increase patient dose capacity across our supply chain. Turning to Slide 11, I'll walk through our cash flow performance. In the first quarter, we delivered free cash flow of $274 million. Our working capital improved year-over-year and reflected improved inventory turns and lower accounts receivable. Many of our lean efforts and priorities associated with inventory management and the collection processes helped drive our progress here. Our strong cash generation, capabilities provides us with the financial flexibility to support future growth, leaving room for organic and opportunistic M&A to accelerate innovation. As previously disclosed, we strengthened our balance sheet by paying down $150 million of debt in the quarter. Now let's turn to our outlook on Slide 12. In short, we are reaffirming our full year 2024 guidance. We expect a modest sequential improvement in second quarter organic sales growth and adjusted EBIT margin. As discussed in our fourth quarter call, we expect stronger revenue growth and adjusted EBIT margin in the second half of the year. There are a few catalysts that will support growth through the rest of the year. This includes a number of new product launches that will accelerate growth in ultrasound. In addition, we expect to see growth in imaging supported by healthy backlog and a large order funnel. We expect continued growth in our PDx business as procedure trends remain strong. And in PCS, we have healthy backlog and expect the fulfillment challenges in the first quarter to resolve by midyear. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Pete. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Jay. Turning to our Precision innovation strategy on Slide 13. We're excited about recent product introductions across our segments to address customer challenges and improve patient outcomes. The industry continues to be challenged with higher rates of clinical burnout, fueled by increased demand for imaging and caring for an aging population. Our customers need solutions that increase flexibility in staffing, scheduling and operations. Digitally enabled remote scanning and connected patient monitoring are ways we can help address these issues. In the U.S., GE Healthcare is the exclusive distributor of a vendor-agnostic system that allows clinical experts to provide remote MR, CT and PET/CT scanning support and image review. By enabling virtual clinical experts to provide real-time guidance to technologists on site, we're helping to address staffing shortages and streamlining operational workflows. Our Portrait Mobile and Monitoring Solutions platform recently introduced the Portrait Vital Signs monitor in the U.S. and Europe. This new solution integrates with the EHR, allowing clinicians to customize early patient warning scores like low oxygen rates and declining blood pressure to identify patient deterioration sooner. We're also focused on advancing cancer research and creating AI to address some of the biggest challenges in cancer care. For example, immunotherapy has revolutionized the way we think about cancer treatment. However, patient outcomes vary with some response rates ranging from 15% to 30% in solid tumors and 45% to 60% in melanoma. Because of this variation, a considerable amount of research is focused on determining treatment response. AI can potentially make a difference. In our Pharmaceutical Diagnostics business, we created AI research models in collaboration with Vanderbilt University Medical Center. It demonstrated a 70% to 80% accuracy in predicting cancer patients' response to certain immunotherapies. What's unique about the approach is that we created these AI models using routinely collected data available in the EHR, giving them the potential for broad deployment and adoption, methodology that was recently published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. These AI models have the potential to help clinicians to match patients to the most effective treatment sooner while avoiding unnecessary side effects and costs, and could be integrated into our digital suite of tools in the future. We're bolstering our leading portfolio in ultrasound with 6 new products introductions that includes significant upgrades, platforming solutions and new artificial intelligent applications for radiology, urology and cardiology. This is a direct correlation to our increased investments in R&D dollars. We've supported clinicians for more than 30 years with our premium general imaging platform, logic. And we're excited to share that we've made significant enhancements. These include the launch of 3 upgraded premium systems and a new mid-tier solution, the LOGIQ Totus, all with AI and Vscan Air wireless handheld probe integration. Our new urology-based software feature, Prostate Volume Assist, is now available on several bkActiv imaging systems. Between MIM Software's prostate fusion solutions and the power of AI, we're strengthening our prostate-focused ultrasound solutions and improving the cancer journey for providers and patients. Earlier this month, we launched the Vscan Air SL with Caption AI Cardiac Guidance at the American College of Cardiology Conference. By integrating AI into our handheld system, we're enabling clinicians to acquire up to 10 standard cardiac use with guidance, creating even more access and use cases for ultrasound point of care. For example, with AI in the palm of their hand, a primary care physician with less ultrasound experience may uncover heart disease sooner, or cardiologists can easily and automatically calculate a left ventricular ejection fraction, potentially diagnosing heart failure early. We expect these advancements in Ultrasound to drive price and cost efficiencies over time and continue to realize more productivity while accelerating growth. We also continue to build our reputation as a trusted partner in ultrasound with several collaborations to address growing patient needs globally. For example, 2 leading public health agencies in China recently chose GE Healthcare to develop innovative technologies, patient management models and clinical trading programs to improve outcomes for patients with liver disease. In summary. On Slide 14, I'd like to thank our team for their focus and execution in the first quarter. I'm encouraged by the progress on the product pipeline and market outlook. This situates us well for an improving growth profile as we move through the year. I look forward to sharing more about our progress and future innovation plans at upcoming conferences. I'd like to introduce that we will host our Investor Day on November 21 in New York City. We will provide more in-depth views on technology and innovation. With that, we'd like to open up the call for questions. Carolynne Borders : Thank you, Peter. [Operator Instructions] Operator, can you please open the line? Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question coming from the line of Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer. Suraj Kalia : Peter, can you hear me all right? Peter Arduini : Yes, clear. Suraj Kalia : My apologies for the background noise. So Peter, the obvious question, U.S. year-over-year was flattish. I get your point on China, in terms of ventilators and top comps. Can you set the stage for us in terms of the U.S. portion of the business, the flattish performance in the quarter and how you see it progressing through the year? Peter Arduini : Yes, absolutely. I would just kind of start out to say from that standpoint is just remember, we talked about the compare with our toughest one of the year. So obviously, it gets better throughout the year. We talked about that in our guidance. But really, Q1 was impacted by -- fundamentally, it was 2 items. And Jay touched this on the prepared remarks. One was some fulfillment delays in PCS. I think we've got those well in hand to have them resolved by midyear. I think that's the first part of this. There were specific items, us about technology and more about actually delivery of the components. And then the China piece. And again, we know that anticorruption presents a challenging environment, and we expected that to play out through midyear. I mean those are really the 2 items. If I look at the U.S. specifically, we actually are seeing a more positive backdrop relative to orders funnel, relative to growth potential and really across all of our businesses. And I'd just say ultrasound, I talked a lot just on the call here about new products. 2023 market was somewhat down for the whole market in ultrasound. We see that actually turning around in '24. And so the timing of our new product introductions is very good as well as in imaging. So I'm rather confident on how we're going to see the capital landscape and the market evolve within the United States. But relative to the quarter, it was those 2 specific items that dampened our top line. Suraj Kalia : Got it. And Peter, my follow-up, specifically within imaging, how should we think about backlog, i.e., business that is already in the hands flowing through in the next 3 quarters versus new orders coming in versus NPI and price increase. Just kind of give us how you all are thinking about within imaging as the year progresses, which are the levers to be pulled? And how should we think about the cadence of imaging growth as the year progresses? Peter Arduini : Yes. Great. Thanks. Let me comment and Jay, you can jump in as well on this. So we've got a very solid backlog for our imaging business. I think we feel quite good about the diversity of it, the mix of it and it actually being growing with price in the back. And then new platforming capabilities that are coming in like our IGS system, our new cath lab, which will come in and actually bring better margins. So it's positioned well from that standpoint. We think the profile is going to be more second half just as we've communicated. There hasn't been a lot. We're going to clearly see a pickup in the second quarter but the majority of it is more profiled out towards Q3 and Q4. And again, that really hasn't changed from what we've laid out our initial guidance on. I would say from a broader order standpoint, we expect that we will see an uptick in broader imaging orders both in Q2, 3 and 4. Most likely having a larger step-up in the second half. And some of that's tied to the China stimulus discussion that we had from an order standpoint. But even the U.S. profile, when you take a look at the products that we've got laid out, some of the big deals that we have visibility into the pipeline, they're probably going to nest more so in that second half of the year. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Edward Ridley-Day with Redburn Atlantic. Edward Ridley-Day: So my first question, just to follow up actually on the China stimulus plans. The new Chinese stimulus that is being discussed. We've seen headline details from the authorities there but not much more. Could you speak to what you see the benefit these might be for your addressed markets through the remainder of the year? And your peer yesterday was talking about some evidence of hospital submitting new orders as a result of the potential new stimulus. I don't know if you can speak to that first, please? Peter Arduini : Yes. So look, the data is unveiling as we speak. So I think we don't have perfect information on it. But I think if you look at since our guidance, what is new is obviously, not anticorruption, that's out there. And it's going to continue, we believe, to be tough through mid-year as we said before, we believe that that's going to continue to begin to improve in the second half. What is new is the stimulus. And from our understanding of it, the prior stimulus was more about low interest rates or relief relative to loans, where this will actually be specific cash grants, which then would reach a larger group of institutions that aren't just looking for loans but are looking for supplemental dollars to buy equipment. So we think that, obviously, opens us up to a larger population. The second piece to that then as well is that its ability to be multiyear. And so we'll see how that ultimately plays out. But those are the 2 characteristics. Relative to the rollout of it, I would say what we did see at the end of the first quarter is actually a little bit of tapping of the brakes of some orders in China relative to stimulus coming in and you say, \"Well, why would that be?\" Customers taking a look at to say, \"I really want to understand the rules of it. So when I submit an order, I make sure I get the full benefit of the stimulus.\" So we believe that there's going to be clarity to the stimulus rules, so to speak, at some point here in Q2 and post those rules. Then we would expect an uptake in orders. And then how that plays out, if the orders come sooner, there's more possibility for sales within the year. If the orders come later, businesses like ultrasound that you can do flow shipments, most likely would benefit sooner. Whereas installed products would probably be a little bit later. But net-net, this is all positive and kind of how we see the landscape as we speak right now. Edward Ridley-Day: That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up actually on your Radio Pharmaceutical business. If you can give us any color on when we should expect FDA approval for Flurpiridaz? And also any other updates that we should be thinking about or looking for in the remainder of the year? Peter Arduini : Yes. Look, I mean Flurpiridaz, if it's your reference, is an agent that's in our PDx business that will be used for cardiac imaging and PET/CT. We think it's going to be a really breakthrough approach to be able to do cardiac perfusion imaging and PET/CT. And a lot of it, as you know, is tied to logistics, the half-life and the ability to ship a product there as opposed to have to generate it in fundamentally seconds on site. File has been submitted to the FDA, and we'll provide updates here on the milestones. I think from what I hear from the team, we have everything in. We're not assuming anything within our 24 guidance. I mean this will be more of a '25, '26, '27 event as those ramp up. But all things good, and we'll be waiting to hear back from the agency, if there's any questions or follow-ups that they have for us. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Sezgi Ozener with HSBC. Sezgi Oezener : I hope you can hear me all right. Peter Arduini : Yes. Sezgi Oezener : Great. My first one is on your confidence on the full year '24 outlook. Given the lower book-to-bill, are you more on the lower end? Or do you -- are you equally confident on both ends of your guidance? And the second one is on your pricing versus volume comments. I've seen that the positive pricing comment. Has this been reflected formally across the segments as well as across the region? Some color there would be really helpful. Peter Arduini : So maybe I'll start. Then Jay, you can talk a little bit more about some of the book-to-bill and the cadence. But look, as I walked through just a minute ago, the impact for the first quarter, including the difficult comp, we expect that to alleviate through the year, which, again, gives us strong confidence in our ability to hit our guidance. And again, 4 things. The comps get better quarter-over-quarter. Funnel growing on orders and sales. We have good visibility into, including our service funnel. So how does service grow? When you won share in a previous year, you have 1 year of warranty. When it comes off of warranty, it becomes part of a contract. We're starting to see the benefit of that service growth now in '24. Three, the new products against across the whole product line, but particularly in ultrasound and select areas in Imaging to new products and then an improving China. So that's really the 4 items that kind of gives us confidence. Jay, maybe over to you to talk a little bit how we think about book-to-bill and price. James Saccaro : Sure. From a book-to-bill standpoint, you have to recall that we include in our book-to-bill calculation, both service and PDx coming in at 1 :1. So if we were to adjust those 2 items out, the actual book-to-bill is much higher. So we feel good about the overall book-to-bill that we have for the quarter. The other thing I would say is the backlog sits at near record levels. So we're sitting at roughly $19 billion of backlog. We feel very good about the orders that we have in the backlog. It's a robust pipeline of future sales that we have in place. So overall, that's great. And then as we think about pricing, the pricing environment continues to be solid. We highlighted at the beginning of the year, we expect 1% to 2% in pricing impact to sales. And we're trending very much in line with those expectations. So we had a good quarter from a pricing standpoint. From a volume standpoint, I think Pete highlighted some temporary issues that we've been navigating which we expect to resolve. The other thing to remember is that comps get a lot easier as we move through the rest of the year. So I think all of those elements come into play as we were able to firmly reiterate guidance from a sales and an EPS standpoint. Operator : And our next question coming from the line of Craig Bijou with Bank of America Securities. Craig Bijou : I wanted to start on order growth. And you guys have seen low single-digit order growth over the last 3 quarters. And I understand that there are a couple of reasons for that. But wanted to see if you guys could maybe give a little bit more color on how that order growth translates into revenue growth in subsequent quarters. And your confidence that order growth will really accelerate over '24, and then be able to drive kind of the mid-single-digit revenue growth target that you guys have put out there. Peter Arduini : Yes, Craig, thanks for the question. It's a great question. Look, the reality of it is, is that over the last year plus, 1.5 years, we've actually had a positive book-to-bill ratio again. And we give that ratio with everything in, so that you can see not just the capital piece, but you kind of get a feel for the total composite of it. I think as long as that is a positive scenario and the backlog is almost about $1 billion higher than where it was pre-COVID, we've got a lot of gas in the tank to deliver on mid-single-digit revenue growth. So that's just kind of how the profile of this works. And I think you guys understand with some of the capital that can be lumpy. So shipments tend to be a little bit smoother, but you can pick up significant and a couple of large IDN deals in a given quarter, and your orders can spike up in that quarter and that can be lower in the following quarter. But that's kind of how we see it from that standpoint. The interesting part here is that over the last, I'd say, 12, 18 months, the markets that we've played in and we track these with third-party data, have been probably in the neighborhood of only up 1 point or they've been down a couple of points, relative to different markets in the world. Our outlook, when we see what the rest of this year is and going into '25, definitely brings a more positive view, which we would expect to see orders pick up relative to those markets. So that's one aspect of it. The other side is when you start winning share, and I mentioned this on a previous comment, and you start growing your installed base. The opportunity for the service revenue to play a bigger contributing component in revenue is there. So you saw this quarter, we actually had positive growth within our service component. We would expect that growth rate to continue to advance, grow faster than it did in the first quarter this year, which means in the second half, we have more service contributing to the growth. That service is already in the backlog, and so we have visibility into it. So it's a host of those things. And then obviously, the typical thing. 6 new product launches in ultrasound. We just refreshed the cardiac platform. We just refreshed the Voluson Women's Health care platform, handheld, first cath lab that I would say that we've had in quite some time that is very competitive. Its robotic platform with new tube at CT platform, which is doing well. New wider for MR, our new treaty. All of those then turn around into faster growth in a faster-growing market but also winning some share. So that's -- those are the pieces that give us confidence. But again, I think when you look at our backlog compared to what we need to deliver on mid-single-digit growth, we've got plenty of gas in the tank on that just over the next couple of years. But we would expect to see our orders growth pick up. And my expectation here is in the second half, we're going to start seeing that pick up in that mid-single-digit range. And again, not every quarter will be consistent, but how that will play out over multiple quarters will be in that range. Craig Bijou : Great. And if I could follow up on the hospital CapEx sentiment. You mentioned that it's still pretty good. So are you hear -- I know you guys -- you survey your customers often. So are you hearing any concern given that the interest rate environment, it looks like we're not going to see many more cuts. And then just on top of that, maybe just talk about how the pricing, your ability to get that price that Jay mentioned in one of the previous calls. How does that get impacted in -- if there's some concern or hesitation on capital spending by hospitals? Peter Arduini : Yes. Let me start and then, Jay, you can kind of fill in some of the gaps on this. I think again, if you compare it to over a year ago, you're taking a look at an environment where hospitals were primarily in the red, heavily tied to labor cost. We're seeing that moderate and most of our customers, particularly our big important IDNs back in the black. So I think that's a quarterly. Relative to rates, it's obviously out there. It's a topic. We haven't really seen it come up in a major discussion that's limiting how things are playing out. I still think the underlying play here is that demand for procedures is just still on continuing to grow. So if you think about some of our peer group of the device companies that are showing very high growth rates in their implants, we're showing that same kind of growth in our PDx business because we see that day-to-day. The effect of that on equipment isn't in that same quarter. The effect on the equipment is usually 3 to 4 quarters out. Why is that? Because you're using current equipment, and then you start adding capacity constraints and you need to buy upgrades or new equipment. And so that's what also gives us confidence that we're going to see that pick up in later quarters. But at this point in time, backlogs to get an MR scan or a PET still are much longer than they were pre-COVID. And that brings high-value procedures with into an institution. And again, that's what gives us confidence we're going to continue to see investments that take place, particularly in the United States. Jay, I don't know the price. James Saccaro : That's exactly right. I think -- and we do a survey each quarter. Pete's comments are very reflective of what we heard from our customers, continued procedure volume demand, staffing shortages, ease, good economics for the hospitals. Interest rates really have played a less prominent role in some of those discussions and survey results. So we feel quite good about that. From a pricing standpoint, as I said, we've talked about -- we're talking about low single digit, 1%, 2% price increases. And what we're finding is that's not the difference between buying and not buying. It's not really -- the decisions aren't that sensitive. And so as we continue to emphasize this focus on pricing discipline across the organization, we've been able to see that driving a positive impact for the company. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Larry Biegelsen : A follow-up on China. So sales were down about 11% in Q1 in China. What are the expectations for the rest of the year? Does the new stimulus represent potential upside to the prior guidance? And I had one follow-up. James Saccaro : Yes. I think it will depend upon when the details of the stimulus package are laid out. Because as Pete said earlier, we did see some hesitancy amongst customers as they wait clarity on the stimulus rules before submitting orders and that makes complete sense to me. We've seen that continue in the second quarter of the year. And so from our standpoint, the stimulus package, Larry, we view that as a good long-term catalyst for the market. Exactly when that shapes up with respect to 2024 is something that we're watching. To the extent that we get clarity sooner, then it certainly could be a positive catalyst versus guidance previous to the extent that we're still waiting and there's still hesitancy amongst customers with respect to orders, it could be a sort of a negative in the short term. But again, I think from our standpoint, we're very pleased to learn about this. And long term, it's a very positive development for the overall market. Peter Arduini : Yes. I mean, Larry, the only thing I would add is from our guide, not a lot has changed. The first half, we guided would be negative. The second half will be positive. I think in the second half, the STEM is going to have an effect of probably having a bigger step up in Q4 than Q3 just because of the delivery time to ship equipment. If it gets more clarified within Q2, and you could actually have a little bit sooner. But I think those are the dynamics. I think the good part is, even if it's later, that then benefits a Q1 '25 or Q2 '25, but we're expecting that there's going to be clarity here before we get into the half, and we'll see how that plays out. So fundamentally, our guidance doesn't change, but stimulus could have a benefit to it. But at this point in time, we need to see more of the cards be unveiled. Larry Biegelsen : That's helpful. Pete, you've been very active on the business development front, but mostly very small deals. Is that what we should expect going forward? And maybe just refresh us on areas of interest and if you think robotics is -- would fit within GE Healthcare? Peter Arduini : Yes. Look, Larry, I would just say on your last point on robotics, it's not a -- from a surgical standpoint, it's not a top priority focus for us. I think from a broader standpoint of robotics and AI. And I mentioned our Allia IGS is actually a robot that actually comes into position and how it's used, it's one of the only that's actually used within the cath lab from that standpoint. But tuck-in deals of the right size that have a strategic fit into a core business that enable us to connect different parts of our portfolio to bring more differentiated capability. That's what we're looking at, both in partnership and in acquisitions. So I think that's what you should stay focused on that, that is our primary target. And as we've always said, a larger deal came up, it actually was a really good fit for us, we would obviously take a look at it. But our 85%, 90% target range is the type of deals like the MIM deal that we did that are just really good fits into one, our priorities, right, growing our care pathway within Oncology, linking our products to make them more differentiated on how they actually work together. And we just have a very good funnel of opportunities like those. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Ryan Zimmerman with BTIG. Ryan Zimmerman : A lot has been asked. I want to ask two separate questions. One, [indiscernible] numbers were off to, I think, a strong start for Biogen, at least, that's what it seemed like. And so just curious how the conversation around Alzheimer's has changed at all? Or the trajectory that you're expecting, I think, for the uptake and kind of patient adoption? And then I have a second one on margins. Peter Arduini : Yes, Ryan. So you heard Jay's comments probably on the call. Relatively, we saw some slight upticks here for Vizamyl. I would just again remind everyone what we said is our expectation was that we'll start seeing some uptick more in the second half of the year. I think that's pretty much in line with what we're expecting. I think since we gave guidance, there's been some discussions that the Lilly drug might be a little bit delayed coming out. But when the combination of all of those from a diagnostic standpoint, which is what our role is, we expect to see some of that picking up in the second half of the year. Now relative to any type of major material moves, this is not a '24 play as far as we see it right now. I think we think that, again, in the '25, '26, '27range based on the adoption of both molecules, that's when you're going to see an uptick. There is reimbursement now for the agent in the outpatient center. That's still being worked through an inpatient. And I think as that gets more cleared up, that's also going to drive more need for the product. But we were encouraged to see on a ratio standpoint, the numbers are up significantly from an actual dose standpoint. But we would view that as positive and on track to what we've already communicated on what the ramp should look like during the year. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay. And then, Jay, we spend a little -- go ahead, sorry. Peter Arduini : No. I would say go ahead and ask your next question, Ryan. Ryan Zimmerman : Just, Jay, on gross margins for a bit here. You got some segments kind of down, you got some segments up, in terms of EBIT margin. Pricing, I think we all understand those dynamics but there are still, I think, a lot of TSAs left. And just help us understand kind of the trajectory of gross margin as you see it today and kind of what you're tackling to get that higher outside of maybe price pickup? James Saccaro : Yes. Overall, I think we were very pleased with the first quarter margin performance. And gross margin, in particular, we expanded 120 basis points, really driven by pricing and productivity. Now there's an element that has not yet featured in our numbers, which is related to some of the new products that Pete referenced in his discussion. We'll see benefits from some of the new imaging and some of the new ultrasound products that will also support gross margin expansion. But in the first quarter, it was really about pricing. I discussed that and productivity. In my prepared remarks, I talked a little bit about some of the lean initiatives and what we call the variable cost productivity initiatives that we have in place. And it's safe to say we're off to a great start from a productivity standpoint. We delivered, I think, mid-single digits in each of our businesses, more than offsetting inflation and allowing us to drive this gross margin going forward. And so as we look at things on a full year basis, we will continue to see solid margin -- gross margin performance, supporting the EBIT expansion that we've laid out, 50 to 80 basis points of EBIT expansion. But really nice to see in the face of flat sales, the 50 basis points of expansion that we saw in the first quarter. Now you referenced another comment, which relates to TSAs and we're making good progress there. A lot of great support from GE but also a lot of good work on our team side. We've eliminated, we've removed roughly [ 330 ] -- we're on a path to completing virtually all of the TSAs by year-end. And what will happen as a result of this, I would say, it predominantly impacts SG&A over time. It will allow us to optimize our structure, optimize our IT systems for the needs of our organizations or really a gating factor to get at all of that is coming off the TSA. So we've seen a little bit of benefit in terms of SG&A and G&A savings this year, we'll expect to see more next year as we stand on our own 2 feet as an independent company. So overall, that's really the story on margin. Pete, anything to add? Peter Arduini : Ryan, I would just say and again, just to remind everyone, I mean our focus on the increased R&D dollars is obviously new products. But a really important part of it is kind of doing this gross margin triple, which is getting price out of a new product, increased volume because of differentiated features and reducing the actual cost of that product because of platforming. And so when you do that, obviously, if you can get the growth in the lift because of people want it's differentiated, you get more price at lower cost. We have this focus as we mentioned, that any new product comes out at a higher gross margin. And again, that's something we drive across the whole portfolio. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Graham Doyle with UBS. Graham Doyle : Can I just ask one, again, it's on China, but just to get context for things that we go through a year. So firstly, just on revenues. The comps do get -- I think the comps get a bit easier on the revenue side. But am I correct in saying you did grow revenues in H2? And are you assuming a sort of catch-up now in the numbers that you flagged earlier in the year, that H2 would grow enough to offset this sort of H1 weakness? And then just one question on order intake. I know you've gone to sort of great lengths to explain how the growth sort of algorithm should work through the year on order intake. But what sort of number are we looking for? Because it seems like mid-single-digit growth, when you combine what's happened over the last sort of 12, 18 months, it wouldn't make me super bullish that you could do high single-digit growth in revenue terms next year. But is there something we missed in terms of how you can translate, say, 5% to 6% growth for the next 3 quarters into better revenue growth for 2025? James Saccaro : Sure. Maybe first on the China comp and the contours of the year. As you recall, last year, we saw roughly 20% organic growth in the first half of the year. So when we gave guidance originally, we said first half, negative; second half, positive. And one of the things that we're watching very carefully is the time line around this new stimulus package. As I said earlier, I think this is long term, very positive for the market. But how much of this impact we see in 2024 really relates to sharing more guidance from the government and then also customers acting on it? So we're very bullish. But what that means is certainly, there's going to be some positive impact relative to our previous expectations in the fourth quarter related to stimulus. But what happens in the third quarter and how much of that demand is pent-up paid off in the third quarter versus delayed to the fourth quarter? How much of the fourth quarter stimulus impacts Q1 and Q2 of 2025 to Pete's comments earlier? That's really a question that we're watching very carefully. And so we're optimistic about this. But I think it's -- as we think about the third and fourth quarter, third quarter will be much very flattish in that sort of a range with fourth quarter seeing some of that pent-up demand paid off. But again, a lot of this depends on when all of this comes together from a customer demand standpoint. As it relates to the order one, maybe, Pete, do you want to address that? Peter Arduini : Yes. I think, Graham, I mean, it's a little bit more of the same. I mean, the first part is, again, the markets that we participate in around the world over the last 18 months coming out of COVID, have either been roughly flat or slightly down. We see that trend over the next 2 years. Again, a lot of it tied to this lagging indication that the more actually procedures are growing, more patients are coming into the systems. You need more things that we make. So that's a really important one. And again, I think across all of our markets this year, we'll actually see an uptick over the '23 window. The new NPIs is a big deal. And so again, that adds some pricing growth. It also adds to some share gains with it. And then services. So we have been gaining some share in the last couple of years. Our prior 78%, we haven't probably gained as much. When you do that, you start growing your service base and service becomes a bigger contributor within your overall capabilities. And then the last part is these care pathway here is that we've been nurturing start to bring more growth in the next year or so. Again, from how Alzheimer's we talked about, the cardiovascular care pathways and how products work together, but even a product like Flurpiridaz, those are some of the things that we take a look at, that will continue to kind of drive a focus on mid-single-digit growth in orders that will then translate that into revenue. And then based on timing, you may be slightly higher or lower in a given quarter, but that's the formula that we're executing on. Graham Doyle : Great. A cheeky quick follow-up on China. Just because the sort of stimulus package or idea that you sort of mentioned, I know Philips and Siemens have referenced something similar. Presumably that relates to this medical equipment renewal because it doesn't, on the surface look, particularly ambitious in terms of the 6% CAGR on spend. But is this something you've seen in the past where these things can expand and become bigger? Is that what gives you some cautious optimism around that? James Saccaro : Well, there's a couple of different views out there. There's a larger stimulus number that's in the trillions of yen that's touching multi-industry and that is money that actually is kind of stipend dollars, if you will, that will go to particular areas within health care and other industries. So what that direct distribution looks like it's a big number. That's more of what we're actually referencing. And so again, if you compare it to the previous stimulus, which was interest-free loans, this is portrayed laid out to actually be dollars that will be granted to actually buy equipment. And again, so we believe that will have a larger appeal because by definition, many customers weren't even going for a loan. So this opens up the field for that and it also is being expressed at this point to be not a 90-day or 120-day window, but to be a multiyear approach. So again, more to come and see what the details are on it, but from when we gave guidance to start the year, this is net-net positive, really any way you look at it from a China outlook. And we'll see what it means for this year. But clearly, if implemented the way it's described, it will have a bigger impact as well going into next year. Operator : Our next question coming from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Matthew Taylor : I was hoping you could comment on 2 things. One is that you identified the catalyst in Ultrasound and the resolution for some of the fulfillment issues to resolve catalyst for growth inflection through the year in those segments. Could you help us understand how much inflection that could drive as you work through the launches and resolve the challenges? Peter Arduini : So Matt, let me just take. I'll take a hit at the ultrasound piece. I think you're referring to the PCS shipments on that. You can touch on that. Look, I think with Ultrasound, again, I think the first part is, is that when we look at our market dynamics, they are definitely continuing to improve. And as I say, one of the top 2 largest players worldwide, that has a positive impact. From a standpoint of the compares, I mean, if you take a look at our expectation is that we will continue to ramp our revenue growth throughout the year from Q2 on. And then also from an order standpoint, it's a highly correlated business. I mean just to give you an idea, a vast majority of this business is sell and install. China, this tends to be a larger portion of our business. And so some of the effect that we felt here in the first quarter was directly correlated to the challenges in China. And I think even China STEM will help ultrasound. But ex-China around the world, U.S., Europe, we're bullish on how we'll see the pickup within China -- excuse me, in ultrasound and particularly because of the new product introductions that we've laid out. Jay, what about that? James Saccaro : Yes. And just at the highest level, Matt, I do think we have easing comps throughout the year, and I think that's supportive of the accelerated growth profile at a GE HealthCare level. With respect to PCS, we'll see accelerating growth as we move forward here, with the second half of the year, more similar to growth rates that we saw last year. And as we resolve some of the bottlenecks in the second quarter, we'll see some level of improved growth. But then again, more of those benefits will accrue to the second half of the year. Graham Doyle : Great. And can I ask a follow-up on phasing? You talked about some sequential improvement in organic growth and margin in the second quarter. And that would be modest improvement. If I think about what modest means, maybe going to slightly positive organic and, I don't know, 20 to 40 basis points on margin. If I flow that through, consensus EPS looks like it needs to come down a little bit. Is that kind of thinking your math wrong? Or can you help us at all with the second quarter? James Saccaro : From a second quarter standpoint, we're looking at low single digits on the sales and continued -- we'll see a reasonable expansion versus the prior year. So -- and that will actually, the first quarter is the lowest quarter of the year. So we'll see a little bit more sequential margin expansion more similar to year-over-year improvements versus last year, similar to what we saw in the first quarter. So I don't have the -- we don't talk about consensus. We don't get into that. But I think those are the dimensions that are in play in the second quarter. Operator : And that concludes the question-and-answer session. Speakers, please proceed with any closing remarks. Peter Arduini : Thank you, operator. Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Hopefully, we addressed your questions. We've got all the right pieces in place here to deliver on our annual guidance that we've laid out, and we look forward to connecting with each of you and some upcoming calls or conferences in the next few months. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I will hand the call over to the Chief Investor Relations Officer, Carolynne Borders. You may begin. Carolynne Borders : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to GE Healthcare's second quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined by our President and CEO, Peter Arduini; and Vice President and CFO, Jay Saccaro. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's press release and in the presentation slides available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. And with that, I'll hand the call over to Peter. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Carolynne, and thanks to all those joining us today. In the second quarter, we delivered 1% organic revenue, and 3% orders growth with all segments contributing. We also expanded margins despite headwinds in the China market. We saw particular strength in the U.S. given replacement cycles and increased use of imaging across disease stage for diagnostics, and resilience in the ultrasound market. Excluding China, global revenue growth was 4%, and orders growth was 6%. We believe we're gaining market share in each of our segments, and we are continuing to invest in products and services that will accelerate growth in the future. As it relates to China performance, we previously communicated that the region would experience negative sales growth in the first half as we face a challenging compare. At the time, we expected positive sales growth in the second half. Today, the prolonged timing of the rollout of the new stimulus announced earlier this year is impacting timing of orders and sales. We expect a continued sales decline in China year-over-year in the second half, and we anticipate growth in China will be negative for the year. As a result, we're lowering our total company full year organic revenue growth guidance. It's important to note that despite this revenue reduction, we are maintaining our EPS guidance for the year. Although, we're disappointed with the second half reduction in sales growth, this is a temporary challenge, and we expect to see China market orders recovery later in the year. We continue to view this market as an attractive long-term opportunity. While China weighed on orders and revenues were encouraged by our margin performance in the quarter, our team has embraced lean and identified process and product improvements at the end of 2023 and the first half of 2024. We're now seeing those benefits coming through our P&L along with increased customer satisfaction, ultimately resulting in higher win rates in products and services. We're making great progress executing improvements that deliver better value to our customers and patients and eliminating waste, leveraging continuous improvement or Kaizen (ph). We run approximately 400 sessions throughout the year, and recently completed our global CEO Kaizen week. During the week, we held 28 events across our sites where my leadership team and I joined colleagues to drive and execute process changes and improvements, which is a key aspect of a good Kaizen. Teams were focused on growth, cost and working capital improvements, some of which have immediate impact at the end of the week, while others will drive impact later in the year. One of our cost improvement Kaizens, a team consisting of engineering, quality, and sourcing build a plan for a high running CT platform that will reduce overall costs by 23%, with 15% coming out in the first year. In Waukesha, my team focused on improving our responsiveness to customer demand as well as cost savings for the CT and PET/CT products that we manufacture there. We create a visual management tool called HeiJunka (ph) Board that shows plant capacity, system availability, and customer orders. The new tool will help us level load production, optimize manufacturing flow and meet customer demand while shrinking the lead time on our critical Omni Legend PET/CT system by 31%, and reduce future costs to create these scanners. It was an energizing week for all. Leveraging our productivity progress this year, we are raising our adjusted EBIT margin guidance, and we're reaffirming our outlook for adjusted EPS and free cash flow. Jay will discuss our outlook in greater detail later in the call. Moving to commercial execution milestones. As I mentioned, we had a strong quarter in the U.S. where we secured more than $800 million of multimodality equipment, software and service contracts. The U.S. market continues to be robust, particularly in Imaging, IGT and Ultrasound. We saw strong orders and sales growth in the region and continue to see a healthy pipeline for growth. In July, we made two important announcements to develop proprietary AI tools to help expedite clinical and operational efficiencies. This included our agreement to acquire the AI division of Intelligent Ultrasound, a developer of AI tools for women's health ultrasound products, and a strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services to build foundation models and generative AI tools to streamline hospital operations and care delivery. Now, I'll pass it to Jay, who will take us through the details of our second quarter performance. Jay? Jay Saccaro : Thanks, Pete. Let's start with our financial performance on Slide 4. For the second quarter of 2024, revenues of $4.8 billion were up 1% organically year-over-year. Recall this quarter's results compared to 9% growth in the second quarter of 2023, when we experienced easing supply chain constraints. As you can see from our filing this morning, the continued market headwinds in China impacted total company sales growth in the quarter by approximately 300 basis points, meaning, global sales growth excluding China was approximately 4%. Organic orders growth was solid increasing 3% year-over-year, driven by strength in the U.S. and rest of world. Excluding a 300 basis point impact of China on orders, orders growth would have been 6%. Orders dollars continue to outpace sales leading to a strong total company book-to-bill of 1.06 times versus 1.04 times last year. As a reminder, equipment only book-to-bill is higher than total company book-to-bill. We exited the second quarter with a healthy backlog of $19 billion including strong services growth. Adjusted EBIT margin was 15.3%, up 60 basis points year-over-year, driven by continued improvement in gross margin with productivity and price. Second quarter adjusted EPS was $1, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting adjusted EBIT growth and lower interest expense. Free cash flow was in line with our expectations and was negative due to the timing of certain payments. On Slide 5, let's take a closer look at segment revenue performance for the second quarter. We saw very strong PDx sales growth of 14% organically, aligned to global procedural demand. China market headwinds negatively impacted both our Imaging and Ultrasound segments. Service revenue on a reported basis increased 2%. We continue to make very good progress on margin expansion. Let's walk through this on Slide 6. In the quarter, adjusted gross margin expanded 110 basis points, and adjusted EBIT margin expanded 60 basis points. The team has made significant progress, utilizing lean capabilities to focus on margin accretive actions. As a result of these actions, adjusted gross margin increased 100 basis -- 110 basis points and adjusted EBIT margin grew 60 basis points through the first half of 2024. Gross margin was particularly strong in PDx with volume and stabilization of raw material costs, and Imaging gross margin expanded, led by new product introductions. In our PDx segment, we hosted a Kaizen in our court facility in May, which led to over 1.5 million doses of annual capacity improvement and cycle time reduction. This is another great example of how lean enables us to increase our volume and expand margins. In IT, we're focused on permanent cost optimization actions that are resulting in ongoing cost savings. For example, we have consolidated more than 40 vendors supporting our applications to one vendor, as we signed a managed service agreement that has resulted, and more than $40 million of annual savings. As we exit TSAs, we're developing solutions specific to GE HealthCare's needs. For example, moving more to the cloud and reducing internal data centers, as well as consolidating the number of devices we use. We expect this to drive an additional $20 million of savings in 2024. On the gross profit side, we drove mid-single digit variable cost productivity across all segments in the quarter. In the second quarter, we invested more than $300 million in R&D, growing 10% year-over-year, while expanding our margin, recently introduced products with AI are driving higher margins. Now I'll turn to segment performance. Let's start with Imaging on Slide 7, where we had flat organic revenue growth. This was against a difficult comparison to the prior year when sales were up 9%. Growth in this segment was also impacted by China market headwinds. Segment EBIT margin was up 40 basis points year-over-year. We continue to make progress on enhancing gross margins through productivity and price, while also investing in R&D. Margin improved sequentially by 130 basis points versus the first quarter of 2024 due to volume leverage. New product introductions are contributing to particular strength in U.S. product demand. Turning to Ultrasound on Slide 8. Organic revenue was down 1% year-over-year, primarily due to China market headwinds. Segment EBIT margin decreased 120 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower sales in China and inflation. This was partially offset by cost productivity achieved through standardization and new product introductions. We continue to see solid customer demand, especially for our recently launched products. Moving to Patient Care Solutions on Slide 9. Organic revenue was up 1% year-over-year, following 9% growth in the prior year. Segment EBIT margin decreased 90 basis points year-over-year due to product mix, while productivity actions offset inflation, with expected contributions from new product introductions and a healthy backlog, we are well positioned to drive future growth. Moving to Pharmaceutical Diagnostics on Slide 10. We had another strong quarter, generating 14% year-over-year organic growth, driven by volume, pricing and new product introductions. Segment EBIT margin of 31.2% improved 450 basis points year-over-year driven by sales volume, productivity and pricing. We're pleased with the continued margin expansion in this segment. Security of supply remains top of mind for our customers, and we're continuing to make investments to enhance global supply of contrast agents and radiopharmaceuticals to meet increased demand. In particular, we're encouraged by positive developments in the molecular imaging market. We saw continued acceleration of Vizamyl doses delivered in the U.S. in the second quarter. These sales increased three-fold. Turning to Slide 11 on cash flow performance. In the second quarter, free cash flow was negative $182 million due to the normal timing of compensation and interest payments. We continue to expect strong cash generation for the full year. Free cash flow is expected to be substantially higher in the second half of the year relative to the first as a result of seasonality, given higher volumes as well as the timing of certain supplier and compensation payments that occur earlier in the year. Our strong cash flow profile continues to provide us the flexibility to advance our growth strategy, while reinvesting in the business and executing a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Now let's turn to our outlook on Slide 12. We're taking a prudent approach and are lowering our full year 2024 organic revenue growth guidance to be in the range of 1% to 2% due to temporary market headwinds in China. Despite this reduction, we're raising our guidance for adjusted EBIT margin expansion, which we now expect to be 60 basis points to 90 basis points year-over-year, associated with the continued momentum we're seeing on productivity and optimization initiatives, along with contribution from NPIs. We're reaffirming our expected -- our expectation for adjusted EPS in the range of $4.20 to $4.35 with growth of 7% to 11% and free cash flow of approximately $1.8 billion. We expect third quarter year-over-year organic revenue growth of approximately 1% and adjusted EBIT margin expansion to be relatively similar to second quarter. We would expect year-over-year organic revenue growth and adjusted EBIT margin in the fourth quarter to be the highest of the year. As you think about the year, I would note that we expect the revenue headwind from foreign exchange to be less than 1% in 2024. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Pete. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Jay. Building on my comments from earlier in the call, our lean culture has allowed us to create a strong pipeline of innovation and accelerate our ability to bring differentiated solutions to market for patients and customers. We'll dive deeper into some of what you see on the slide at Investor Day. But today, I'd like to focus on growth in PDx and Imaging. We're encouraged by the recent CMS reimbursement proposal has potential to benefit patients in the U.S. who are facing cancer, cardiovascular and neurological diseases. This step is expected to unlock the value of our radiopharmaceuticals and PET and SPECT scanners, ultimately enabling more precise diagnostic and treatment planning for patients. To give you some perspective, for the last decade, these molecular imaging agents were treated as a supply with limited reimbursement, with prevented broad scale use. Assuming the new rule goes into effect on January 1, 2025, we expect CMS will begin paying market value for these agents, some of which have an average sale price of thousands of dollars. The change will give hospitals the needed reimbursement to cover their costs better, which has been a long-standing challenge in this space. This comes at a time when we continue to see momentum with existing radiopharmaceuticals, including DaTscan, Vizamyl and Cerianna and the promise of future molecules such as Flurpiridaz, for cardiovascular disease. We expect each of these products will benefit from the new reimbursement rule. As Jay mentioned, Vizamyl doses continued to grow in the second quarter in the U.S. with the recent FDA approval of donanemab, we anticipate even further uptick of our diagnostic amyloid PET agent. This is still a small contributor to sales growth, but gives us optimism about its sales potential over the next few years. On the equipment side of PET imaging, we expanded our upgradable Omni Legend platform by introducing a smaller detector providing upgradability and value, so customers can adopt the scanner to meet the evolving needs of their patients. We also introduced MINItrace Magni, a small, low cost cyclotron for in-house production of tracers and radioisotopes. And this will help regional hospitals with limited access to commercial distribution or larger hospitals with siting issues that prevent them from building the infrastructure needed to accommodate a traditional size cyclotron. Turning to Slide 14. We're aligning our ultrasound and image guided therapies business to better position ourselves for how clinicians use these two modalities in high growth settings. For example, you can see how multiple products work in conjunction inside an electrophysiology suite and when integrated in the workflow, create a better experience for our customers and patients. These two businesses combined unlock more value than they do separately. We are looking forward to sharing more about this at Investor Day. We also made strategic leadership appointments aligned to these changes. As of July 1, Roland Rott, our previous Head of Ultrasound is leading Imaging; and Phil Rackliffe, Head of Image Guided Therapies is leading Ultrasound and IGT. Roland and Phil have deep industry knowledge, global mindset and significant expertise with our products and operations, and they're well positioned to lead our two largest businesses and are off to a great start. Before turning to Q&A on Slide 15, I want to thank our team for their commitment to delivering for our customers. In particular, I'd like to thank our government affairs and policy team who advocated for multiple years the proposed CMS hospital outpatient rule for the benefit of patients. As I look ahead, I'm optimistic for a few reasons. One, we have a strong backlog at $19 billion. And with a prudent approach to our revenue guidance, we feel confident that we can deliver on our outlook. We're encouraged by overall capital equipment spend, particularly in the U.S. We delivered solid orders growth in the quarter at 3% or 6% excluding China. Our funnel of productivity opportunities is strong, and we were able to raise our adjusted EBIT margin guidance due to our progress on these initiatives, and there's still much more to do here. We're excited about the pipeline of innovation. We have that solves customer challenges, enables improved patient care and sets us up well for growth in the years to come. More about this in November at our Investor Day. And lastly, given these factors, we're confident that we can deliver on our medium-term goals. With that, we'd like to open up for questions. Carolynne Borders : Thank you, Peter. I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, can you please open the line? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Joanne Wuensch with Citi. Please proceed. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I think I want to spend my question on China, and trying to understand how you think about the pace of opening up new orders from the stimulus program. When do you anticipate it arriving and how as we put our 2025 models together, you think about this rolling into next year? Thank you. Peter Arduini : Hey, Joanne. It's Peter. Thanks for the question. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the stimulus program rollout and the details of those plans are taking longer than we estimated, I think, than many people estimated. Just some background, in 2022, when there was a previous rollout just from the central government, it came out pretty quickly. I think it was around under six months from announcement to roll out, that was kind of the predicate we base assumptions on. In '24, the rollout is taking longer, mainly because it's a combination of each of the 31 provinces and the central government working together and so that's taking longer to roll it out. And we believe that, that's going to be well into late '24 before it begins driving growth. So we've fundamentally taken that out of our numbers. We ultimately expect that this is going to be a positive catalyst for the China market. And we believe it could have a positive impact on orders starting in late '24, but we view this as a limited sales impact just on the time between tenders, orders and sales to take place. And so taking it out of our numbers for the year, we viewed as prudent. But again, we would expect to see the benefit of stimulus having an impact in '25 and obviously, when it does come forward, we'll take advantage of it. Jay, you may want to add a few comments. Jay Saccaro : Yeah. Sure. Just a little more detail on this adjustment. When we provided guidance last quarter, we were estimating roughly a $50 million decline in sales in the second quarter. But we actually saw something worse than that. It was closer to $100 million. And so in fact, as we look at the first half of the year, you can see in our disclosures, trend is down about 15% and we've assumed really as we look to the rest of the year, there's going to be no real impact from China stimulus sales. And also, we're kind of expecting a challenging market for the balance of the year. And so when you think about the guidance adjustment that we did as it relates to '24, at the midpoint of the range of the 1% to 2% range, it's roughly a $500 million impact in China relative to what we previously thought. When China starts -- stimulus starts to come through, it will be a positive development. But we're not trying to time this or estimate the timing of the stimulus package, we've taken it out. On the positive side, we do believe that we are well-positioned once stimulus starts coming through to take advantage of that, as Pete said. So overall, we think the market is a good long term attractive market, but clearly, this year is challenging. The only thing I would say is, historically, China has been around -- or last year's roughly 14% of our business. It will be much less than that this year in the 11% to 12% range, as we think about our current modeling. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Peter Arduini : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Please proceed Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to start with the '24 guidance. Jay, as you mentioned, you lowered revenues by about $500 million, but maintain margins, actually increased margins a little bit and maintained EPS. So my question is, how are you able to maintain margins and EPS given the revenue reduction? I did have one follow-up. Jay Saccaro : Great. Thanks, Larry. So look, I think you heard in our prepared remarks, a lot of emphasis on Kaizen, on lean culture, on cost initiatives. I mean we're really proud of that. And I would say that, that is the thing that has exceeded our expectations as we look at the bottom line throughout the year. We delivered 60 basis points of margin in the first half of the year against very low revenue growth. And in fact, we had a really good gross margin contribution year-over-year, 120 basis points in the first half of the year. And in the second quarter, the formula that we've talked about historically is one that we really delivered on. We had roughly one point of positive impact in price exactly where we hope to be. And then notably, our variable cost productivity initiatives, and we talked a little bit about that more than offset inflation. And then you saw highlights from some of the G&A initiatives, really proud of the work that our IT team is undertaking. But some of those initiatives also contributed in the second quarter. So what happens in the back half of the year is more of the same. In the third quarter, we'll see similar margin expansion to what we saw in Q2. And then in the fourth quarter, at the midpoint of the range, there is some tick up or uptick, I should say, in margin expansion, and it's going to come through continued price. Some of these productivity initiatives offsetting inflation and these cost initiatives that we've had success. And then I would also note that in the fourth quarter of last year, we had around 40 basis points of one-time R&D items we don't expect to repeat. So really, that's the contours of the year as we think about margin improvement. The one thing I would say is, at the beginning of the year, we were cautious and we did risk adjust some of these productivity initiatives and some of these cost containment initiatives. So the question, how do you offset $500 million, it's real execution against these initiatives, delivering incremental profit versus our expectations. I think it's a company-wide effort. It's highlighted by things like kaizen initiative week that we had last week. But overall, I feel very good about the margin trajectory. Larry Biegelsen : That's helpful. And Pete or Jay, I heard Pete, your comments about confidence in the medium term goals. Any high level thoughts right now on 2025? Do you expect some catch-up from China next year? And are you still confident in the mid-single digit growth outlook? Thank you. Peter Arduini : Yeah, Larry. Thanks for the question. So as I mentioned in my closing comments that we feel confident in our midterm -- medium-term goals that we've laid out, both our revenue and our profit goals, profit, obviously, for the reasons that Jay laid out. And really, I would say on the growth side, we don't know what value China is going to create in 2025. Obviously, it's probably going to be more than we had previously expected. We'll have to see how that shakes out, and it's not time to give guidance on that, but that clearly will be a positive. But it's less about markets in my mind. It's more about the core changes we've made in the company. Our commercial execution on large integrated deals our capability to be able to sell more value, get price, be able to actually bring out new products that bring differentiated capabilities. I just feel good about the hand we're holding right now as we kind of finish this year out and move into not only just '25 but beyond. And again, just to make another comment relative to our Investor Day in November, it will be our first as an independent company. We want to really highlight the products that we've been building behind the scenes with this increased R&D investment. Remember, we've stepped up our percentage of R&D a couple of points over the last few years. And so in MR, in CT and PET/CT, in monitoring, in ultrasound, all of our business areas we've been investing in the pharmaceutical diagnostic area, new molecules coming out. So we want to be able to tell that story. And so I feel good about the position that we're in. And we're, again, looking forward here to kind of delivering on this -- our plans for the year and being in a well-positioned over the next couple of years to continue to grow the company. Larry Biegelsen : Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Petrone with Mizuho Group. Anthony Petrone : Thanks. Maybe two-part question here. One is going to be on orders and bookings, and then the second will be on Alzheimer's disease. So the order number, plus 3% and book-to-bill 1.06, comes in despite the headwinds in China and I think a lot of that has to do with just state of the U.S. market. So maybe just a little bit on the U.S. market as it relates to funnel, specifically in the Imaging and Ultrasound segments. How much visibility is there and can this feasibly extend into 2025? And then for Alzheimer's disease, there's a couple of blood-based tests that had results out recently. Clearly, Vizamyl is at least in the early innings here, a preferred imaging solution to onboard Alzheimer's disease patients. So how does Alzheimer's disease play out from the PET/CT side when we consider new test potentially coming in? Thanks. Jay Saccaro : Maybe I'll start with that and then turn it over to Pete for some additional color on orders and the Alzheimer's question. Look, the 3% orders growth in the face of a decline in China, I thought it was a really good result. Orders excluding China were 6% and the book-to-bill, as you point out, actually the book-to-bill for the quarter of 1.06, I think, was the highest since we've spun off. In the U.S., we had a very strong quarter we saw strong orders and sales growth. And frankly, in each of the segments, orders growth outpaced sales growth in the U.S. So really, really nice market there. The market continues to be robust. We're seeing PDx putting very solid numbers up in line with procedure growth. As you know, we do a quarterly survey. And then we also do work looking at all of the surveys out there, in particular with respect to the U.S. And many of our customers are telling us in those surveys, they plan to spend more on capital investments in the second half. So I think that's a really good backdrop as we look to deliver on the guidance that we've just shared. We're seeing growth in the equipment market in the U.S. And we also feel very good about the share position that we've had -- we have. We launched a number of new products in Ultrasound. And so we're seeing a real receptivity to some of the new products that we have in place. So overall, we feel quite good about the U.S. market. We feel good about the orders backdrop. And then the other point I would note is backlog is up sequentially, $300 million in that range at $19 billion. So we're keeping the backlog at the level that we'd like to as we continue to grow the business. Pete, what would you add to that? Peter Arduini : Yeah. No, I think you covered it, Jay, but we just -- I think a train in the U.S. team just had a phenomenal quarter. And it is about products, but it is about -- we've talked about team itself, the talent upgrades that we put in place, the new sales disciplines and processes and really our enterprise value proposition that we bring to a big IDN. We had quite a few larger wins. And again, I'd even site some new product areas like in the vascular lab area, where we're winning growth in the IGT business and taking share that we haven't realistically in previous years. But it's an older installed base in the United States. So we think we actually have a pretty good replacement cycle that's going to continue on. Signals from our customers, particularly CFOs that we survey and such are positive about the investments. And the way this works out is when you see big growth in a lot of the med tech flowable businesses, catheters and such that are in the pharma side, ultimately, that puts more pressure to buy more equipment because you're putting more patients through the system. So we see that in delay coming through, but are quite confident about how we see the U.S. market. Anthony, your question on the radiopharmaceutical side, look, I think we're going to see a lot of different diagnostics pop up in many of these different phases. How well they'll be accepted and integrated into practice, I think, remains to be seen. I think as it relates to Alzheimer's specifically, I think all the baseline tests were done off of PET, pre and the post being able to actually see where the amyloid beta is, actually see the elimination of it on scans, we believe is going to still be a hallmark of the products. And then again, depending on how well those therapies take off, like most things, there will be lots of room for multiple products to continue to grow to do well. I would point though, back to this broader point about the CMS changes that just took place. Again, if you were doing scans and your radio -- your pharmaceutical product, again, in this case, the radiopharmaceutical diagnostic, you only receive maybe a few hundred dollars for reimbursement on it. And now you will receive something closer to the actual list price, which could be thousands of dollars, all of a sudden, the economics for a health care provider to move to that space makes a lot of sense. And if you have a larger distribution network of multiple molecules that you're bringing to that customer, you can contract that at a larger scale. And that's really what we're super excited about. Obviously, Alzheimer's being one part of that, but breast cancer, Parkinson's disease, cardiovascular disease down the road, all of those, we look and say, with some of these changes that have taken place, we're optimistic about what growth that can bring. Anthony Petrone : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar : Hi, guys. Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. Jay, my first question was on guidance. Revenues cut by 250 basis points. I think operating margins tweaked up 10 basis points doesn't really explain the EPS, right? Any below the line assumptions change tax expense, other income? Jay Saccaro : No. I mean, broadly speaking, the below the line assumptions are unchanged. And so as we look at it, we have a revenue reduction. It's supported by what we've put forth. I think it is a fairly -- it continues to be a fairly wide EPS range, and a lot of that reflects the uncertainty that we see in China. So no major changes below the line, but -- and feel good about, in particular, given the strong performance in the first half, along with the continued line of sight to some of these additional productivity initiatives, we feel good about delivering on this range. Vijay Kumar : Understood. And Pete, one for you. I know you've spoken about new product momentum, NPI. You talked about some of these new products that you're launching, about to launch. I think you've had a bunch of software side as well. Maybe list them out and what is incremental share as we look at back half into the medium term? Peter Arduini : Yeah. I think -- look, I think we've got -- across the business, we've had some multiple updates and upgrades across the product family line coming to value MR products that we've just introduced come out with a significant amount of upgrade product. I think one of the things that's driving a lot of growth, particularly in MR is our upgrades to our deep learning module in that case, the [indiscernible] capability and installed base upgrades. In the Ultrasound space, particularly in General Imaging, we introduced a quarter back quite a few new versions updated that product line, that has done quite well. This is the logic plant. So there's almost four different derivatives there, plus in our volumes in women's health care line. And we're seeing those pacing on track, if not better. You might have seen our revenue in Ultrasound was a little light in this particular quarter. But as we go into the second half, we expect that's going to pick up. In fact, our orders was positive. We had good orders pick up here. So that's a positive sign as we look forward. I mentioned vascular and IGT. We're doing quite well with our surgical C-arm OEC business. There's a bunch of new software applications in-room capabilities that bring almost Cath Lab like capabilities into a mobile C-arm. Our Allia platform, we're doing quite well with, which is growing share. And I'd say on the PDx side, particularly, on our monitoring systems that are in room, the new monitors themselves, we\u2019re seeing some nice pickup. So that\u2019s the broader mix. And then what I was mentioning at Investor Day, we\u2019ll talk about what we\u2019re going to see in the \u201825 through \u201827 range. Now how we\u2019re thinking about where we are with Photon Counting, next-generation MRI, broader capabilities within PET/CT imaging, just to give an example. So those are some of the bigger investments, obviously, we\u2019ve been making for the past few years, and they\u2019re well on track, and again, will be a highlight of our Investor Day in November. Vijay Kumar : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, guys. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Vijay. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed David Roman : Thank you and good morning, everybody. I wanted to dig into China a little bit further. Understanding that the stimulus is a bit of an unknown. Maybe we could just take a step back and you could talk a little bit about just underlying drivers in China because as you look at some of the third-party data, it looks like the vast majority of the installed base across Ultrasound CT and MR has been refreshed in the past four years. So how should we think about the medium-term underlying growth in China? And is it more than just stimulus impacting the outlook here? Jay Saccaro : Yeah, David. Good question. As we look at China, Historically, we've seen this as a very robust growth market. Previously at our Investor Day, we talked about China growth of 6% to 8%. And we feel good long term about the growth dynamics in China. We had a very solid year last year with double-digit growth, and then we see a decline this year. But our decline this year is not related to age of installed base as we see it. Our decline this year is very much related to limited buying activity by hospitals as they await clarity on the stimulus. As it pertains to your specific comment on age of installed base, the one thing I would note about your comment is that a lot of the recent purchases in the time frame that you referenced and the refreshed equipment, we're at lower end or counting hospitals versus major institutions where we have a higher presence. And so as we look at the age of our installed base in areas like Ultrasound and Imaging, it is above the numbers that you've described and is kind of consistent, broadly speaking, with global averages. So I do think there is a dynamic of the tier of hospital in play. But overall, we think this will continue to be a really nice market for us long term. Pete, I don't know if you'd add anything. Peter Arduini : Yeah. I think you covered it, Jay, but just a couple of facts. As you know, David, I mean, the China population 1.4 billion, about 400 million have you say, pretty good access. There's 1 billion people that don't. So we have a partnership with Sinopharm with other broader distributor capabilities to be able to reach into that untapped market. And so that will continue to be a growth areas. It's probably also going to be part of some of the investments that the government is making. The other tidbit is that used equipment isn't actually allowed to be sold within China. And so there really isn't a recycling of used equipment around. It ends up being all new equipment coming in. And so that actually haven't has a higher effect on growth than in other markets where, particularly in the United States, where we have quite a bit of upgrades, and movement around equipment, that doesn't exist in China. So when we look at the numbers, I think we feel pretty good about what the longer term growth potential is just based on those facts. David Roman : That's super helpful. And maybe just a follow-up on some of your comments about the U.S. We've now heard a couple of companies talk about operating rooms and other parts of the hospital facing capacity constraints. You called out EP as an area of growth focus for you. How should we think about kind of your tethering to some of these higher growth attractive end markets for that structural heart or EP? Do we see that in your Interventional Imaging segment? So how should we think about the contribution to GE? And then does that change any of your sort of strategic thoughts here from a business development standpoint on areas of interest being you sit around the periphery of a lot of these procedures kind of going more into the implantable device or sort of inside the body side of things? Peter Arduini : Yeah, David. It's a really good question. And obviously, we'll spend more time in some strategic settings on this. But look, at a high level, we have the strategy we focus on -- we articulated D3, which, again, is smart integrated connected devices that work together around a given disease state or care pathway, and enable to drive more productivity or better outcomes with digital AI features. And so if you take that EP example you had, the first part is having world class electrophysiology labs, that we can win the hardware. And the reality of it is, a few years ago, we probably didn't have all the right features. We do now. So we think from a standpoint of winning those labs, we're going to win at a higher rate than we did in the past. On the disease stage side of electrophysiology itself, we actually have folks that are primarily focused on that to say, how does ultrasound, how does the EP devices, how does the actual data systems work together so we can come up with a better solution. And we are working on that. It's one of the main reasons that we created the IGT ultrasound alignment because there's a lot more cardiovascular benefits in everything from channel to the development side. And to your broader point, when you start thinking about disease states, it opens your lens up to say, well, should I partner with this company more because if we do, we could solve this customer problem or should I buy this asset because together, these four things create more value? And to answer your question, absolutely, we\u2019re expanding our horizons to think about what should be part of GE HealthCare. David Roman : Terrific. Thanks so much and look forward to seeing you in November. Peter Arduini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Jefferies. Matthew Taylor : Hi. Thank you for taking the question. I guess I had one question on the PDx business. You talked a little bit about the Medicare changes, obviously, a big positive for that space. I guess I was wondering if that changes your thoughts on the long-term opportunity or the growth rate for the contrast media molecular imaging markets that you're in? And I was hoping -- you've called out Vizamyl a couple of times the last few calls with the great growth you're seeing there, if you could outline the opportunity for that or for Flurpiridaz just to give us a better sense of what they're contributing today or how you feel about them contributing to growth, especially next year as you launch Flurpiridaz? Jay Saccaro : Sure. Maybe I'll start with a few comments and then turn it over to Pete as well. Overall, the PDx business has been growing really well. We saw 14% in the second quarter. A lot of that relates to volume, about 10% of that relates to volume, with a couple of points of price and new products also contributing. And you heard us talk about some of the new specialty products in the call. We talked about Vizamyl volumes tripling in the U.S. And based on the new CMS along with the new approval, we're really optimistic about this particular product long-term. And if I think about areas that are changing relative to the prior Investor Day and prior investor -- our long-term expectations, this whole area is one that we have a little bit more optimism on. Vizamyl sales at this point are still very small. So we're still talking a few million dollars. But as we see the uptake of the Alzheimer's therapies, we're seeing continued interest and implementation of programs to support diagnostics in this area. So we expect to see continued growth throughout the year. I think the CMS ruling could unlock accelerated growth next year, both in Vizamyl, Flurpiridaz and some of the other products that we're working on. Pete, I don't know if you'd like to add to that. Peter Arduini : Yeah. I just think we haven't framed up what all the longer term growth yet will be on the molecules. But needless to say, we're more optimistic today than we were prior to the approval. And again, what we're working through right now and frame this up is just take an example, again, of a product that the hospital might be paying a couple of thousand dollars for, but they're getting reimbursed $200 for. Now in the future, they'll get reimbursed at what they're paying for it. And so to be able to detail that and have a discussion with an institution about how to build out a program that's actually going to be a value creator for them. And our confidence that the outcome capabilities for the patient is higher is very strong. So if you think about Cerianna for metastatic breast cancer, it's actually on many of the guidance documents now, but it's challenging economical for someone to actually implement it on a day-to-day process. On tomorrow situation, that changes. And the other aspect is probably even less about what we do on diagnostics and more about what pharmaceutical companies are doing with therapies. And so the more therapies that come out in the space, the more you need someone like a GE HealthCare that has the equipment, the data integration, the distribution capabilities and the diagnostic molecules to help kind of solve the equation. And so, we will obviously spend more time on this with investors, but this is a very positive direction and it's quite helpful for our growth strategies in the coming years. Matthew Taylor : Thanks, guys. Can I just ask one follow-up to on China? I'm just trying to square your comments with some of the competitors, the peers and your approach to guidance there. I guess do you think that your -- seeing the same things as your competitors are talking about -- they're talking about orders starting to come back through the second half of the year. And I'm just curious if you're being more purposeful about being conservative with your China guidance just given the uncertainty there or do you think that you're aligned with how others are calling it? Jay Saccaro : Sure. So just to start, and I'll turn it over to Pete. First half decline in sales, 15%. As we look at the market and the orders in the market, and we're talking about market and tender activity versus anything share related, we think a prudent number is in this -- adjust down the number $500 million at the midpoint, leading to a high teens decline in the second half of the year. Now again, we've taken out the benefit of impact from stimulus on sales. And I would also say that through at least the third quarter, we have a very locked-up dynamic on orders and into the fourth. Now could we be wrong to the upside? We might be. But as we look at it today, we felt it was prudent not to try to time the impact on the fourth quarter in terms of sales, and we've removed that. I'm hopeful that we do better. But at this point, we think this was the right thing to do. We'll watch the stimulus really carefully as we think about what the impact on to 2025 will be. But we have continued declines in a tough market forecasted. And again, it's not a GE specific item. This is a broad-based market view that we have. Matthew Taylor : All right. Helpful color. Peter Arduini : I think Jay hit the point. So again, when this comes back, for us, this is really largely related to timing of the China stimulus program. So we're not betting on the timing. We think we've got our base case lined out well, which is really tied to our installed base, what's our secured business that we have here coming through the second half. And as I mentioned, we would expect to see some orders uptick later this year. But when we take a look at particularly the equipment we have between the time you win a tender, get an order, have the room ready and install it, that order to sales piece would be very tight. And hence, why we just decided to take it out. Matthew Taylor : Thanks. Thanks, Pete. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Graham Doyle with UBS. Peter Arduini : Good morning, Graham. Graham Doyle : Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I got a follow-up on China. So just when -- Jay, you kindly called out the actual number. It looks to me like there's kind of like 40% down in H2 versus your original assumption, which is obviously a very, very large change. And I just make sort of wonder what's the confidence then that you do with your midterm targets so starting from next year, given how volatile that market is? And to the point Matt made, I mean, I was with both Siemens and Philips today. And it does sound like they're not forecasting a decline of anywhere near that magnitude in the second half in China revenue. So is it genuinely just a lot more prudence or is there something happening in, say, the patient monitoring market that maybe the others are seeing? It would be great to get that color. Thank you. Peter Arduini : Yeah, Graham. I know I can start. I mean, look, for our business in China, it's primarily an imaging ultrasound story. All of us have different mixes of products. So there's not obviously a one-to-one match. But I'll tell you what we did. So what we've done is, we have our sales force pulling out to all 31 of the provinces, all of our big customers and actually asking the questions, when you're going to buy, what you're going to buy, what that's going to look up, and we kind of roll that all up for each 31 Providence and try to understand from what they're saying, what the timing would look like. And then based on that, understand how long it takes a tender, how long it takes to get to order, how much time then to actually do an install based on the mix. And when we do that rollout, we do think there's going to be orders coming but we just don't think that there's enough time on the clock from a sales standpoint. And to Jay's point, we might be wrong, but we're not in the business of trying to guess, and we just thought it prudent to take it out. Graham Doyle : Okay. Just to the context of the question, why was it in there in the first place? Like at what point did you put stimulus into the guidance? At the start of this year, was it Q1 because it didn't seem like something that was that not certain to start. So I'm just trying to figure out how much more [indiscernible] will you have taken down? Peter Arduini : Yeah. Fair. Look, a very fair question. Keep in mind, in 02, when the stimulus came within four to six months, it ramped unbelievably quickly. And so I think as we started the year, it wasn't super clear what -- if there was going to be stimulus or not, I think you may recall. But as we got closer to Q2, the question is, if it follows the same ramp, it's going to probably be within this year. What's new is the fact that when it is slower and someone's deciding to buy, if you buy something now, you may not get the 30%, 40%, 50% value from the government to actually support your sale. So naturally, you're going to wait to kind of make a decision to see what stimulus is. That's really the difference here in the calculation that I don't think anybody saw that would take that much longer. Jay Saccaro : I mean the only thing to add is, this is not even like so, we're seeing a depressed level of demand relative to normal as people await clarity. We think the stimulus is a good positive thing long term. But in the market, as we saw it in Q2, as we see Q3 quarter-to-date, it is depressing activity in the market thus far. And so that's why we made the assumption that we did. Graham Doyle : Okay. Fair enough. [indiscernible] for this period. [indiscernible]. Thanks a lot guys. Peter Arduini : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Thank you so much. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wood with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Patrick Wood : Brilliant. Thank you so much taking the questions. Apologies, if I heard this wrong. I thought you guys mentioned that Q3 was something like plus 1% organic. And so, of the implied Q4 step-up, qualitatively, how much is a function of those ultrasound launches relative to the strong U.S. Imaging market? Apologies if I missed this earlier, but if you could just unpack the 4Q, that would be really helpful. Jay Saccaro : Sure. A lot of this comes down to the strong order performance that we saw in the second quarter and when we booked that for delivery in Q3, Q4 for the ex-China business, maybe taking a step back and talking about revenue confidence generally. Patrick, about 45% of our revenue is recurring revenue, either in the form of services or PDx. And I would say the volatility around these categories is reasonably low. We have decent predictability. Now the remaining 55% is equipment. And so for us, as we think about equipment, one of the things we look at is the security rate, which is the equipment that we have in the backlog that's scheduled for a given quarter. Over the last four quarters, we had around 75% of our revenue in this secured rate coming from the backlog, with the other 25% sold and installed in the quarter, right? So really 25% of the equipment is up for grabs in a given quarter, that's a phenomenon, again, that we see generally speaking in each of the quarters. As we look at the second half of the year, we see this similar, if not slightly better than the historic 75-25 split going into the second half. And so really, what the Q4 step-up, there's a normal step-up from Q3 to Q4. But in specific as it relates to why we have this high level of confidence, it comes down to the backlog and when we're expecting those deliveries to take place. So really, that's the driver around the step-up. Of course, to your point, we're going to see continued performance on some of the new product launches. We're also expecting to see continued robust performance out of the U.S. market. But again, the analytics that we have really supports this Q4 step-up, which we feel good about. Peter Arduini : I think the other point you touched on it, Jay, is with some of the share gains we've had on some of the larger equipment a year ago, we actually have now service contracts growth, and we're expecting our service contract growth during the second half, not just expecting we can see it. It's already on the books. We'll step up a few points in the second half, and that has a higher margin. And obviously, it's already on the books. Patrick Wood : Yeah. Good point on the warranty role. Very one quick follow-up. It's been a few years since I ran this math, but the U.S. installed base, last time I tried to back it out. I got the average age, it's something like seven years, so pretty old. I don't know if you have any instinct on how that number kind of hits here. Peter Arduini : Yeah. I think it obviously varies quite a bit by modality. It varies by company, too, based on -- if you're taking a look at your own installed base or the overall, I think, in average, it's a little bit older than that. We have some modalities, particularly in MR, where it's probably even a few years older than that. And so that's really boding well right now for us doing upgrades and stuff on conversion. But we believe when we take a look at the whole of ours plus the installed base, there's actually a reasonable amount of replacement cycle needed because of the age. Patrick Wood : Brilliant. Thank you. Peter Arduini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our last question is coming from the line of Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed. Suraj Kalia : Good morning, Peter, Jay. Can you hear me all right? Peter Arduini : We can. Good morning. Suraj Kalia : Yeah. So thank you for taking my questions. And Peter, I'll throw both of them, you guys this way. And both of these questions are designed really for assessing the differential impact. So first on China, Peter, I wanted to piggyback on David's question from earlier. Your competitors are talking about value partnerships, local for local. And maybe set the stage, when China opens up right. Will the rising tide lift everyone equally or do you think there will be a differential impact? And part of me is also thinking, how is the book-to-build specifically within China, looking for the different people? And how should we think about when China opens up, what is the differential impact? Peter, that's one question. And I'll throw the second one also quickly your way. Radiopharmaceuticals, again, your competitors are talking about pharmacy networks that give them an edge in radiopharmaceuticals. Help us understand GE's buffers for growth in the segment, especially given what Medicare is doing? Thank you for taking my question. Peter Arduini : Sure. I would say, look, on China, I don't know if I have any better crystal ball than anyone else. I think we are making the assumption that a rising China will benefit everyone at some level. Obviously, there's a lot of local competition. There's multinational players. I think everybody will play at a different point. We've been manufacturing for over 35 years, we source locally for the in China market. And so we believe we can compete just like a local company. And we're very focused on, as you move into the non postal cities into the west areas that you need to actually be even more of a value-based product and capabilities. And so there's two sides that's very high end and also value. And I think we've got the type of lineup that we can be competitive there. But I don't think I have any better insights relative to that on how China will play out. Jay, I don't know if you want to add any comments there. Jay Saccaro : Sure. I mean, I think we'll watch it over time, but we feel very good about the share position that we've been able to protect over time. And a lot of that comes down to the manufacturing that we do in China, for China, the large teams that we have on the ground that Pete described. So from a share standpoint, we've been fairly effective thus far. And so as we look at the next stimulus, we have all reasons to believe we'll be able to participate in that market going forward, and we're designing plans to execute on that. Peter Arduini : So if we switch to your question relative to kind of radiopharmaceuticals. And look, our -- we'll spend again more time on this at our Investor Day. But again, if you think about what makes us unique everything from cyclotrons and capabilities for on-site generation of your own isotopes at an institution, we're one of the very few companies that kind of has that as well as the PET technology and PET/CT, PET/MR. And actually in the spec camera world becomes super important and multi-head 10-plus head system that allows you to do some of these oncology staging drugs. And again, if you don't have that, that part of the exam could be 1.5 hours, where on our system, it's 15 minutes. So there's phases of that. Network, we do have a distribution structure. There are some other players that have a much larger distribution structure. I would argue with the CMS change, the real value here isn't if you can distribute it, it's this do you actually make it. And so we actually make these molecules that are in some ways is going to be transformational relative to diagnosis of certain diseases. And you could argue they've been handicapped because they haven't been given their fair share of reimbursement for the value they create. It's a preliminary rule. We believe that's going to come into effect on January 1. If it does, we do think that you're going to definitely see significantly more growth on these molecules than we had estimated they would being treated as a supply. So more to come. And obviously, that gives us more energy to say this is a space to invest and obviously, continue to build out on. Thanks for your question. Operator : And this concludes the Q&A session. Please proceed with any closing remarks. Peter Arduini : Thank you, everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to connecting with you in the coming days at one of our conferences in the next few months. As a reminder, we'll host our Investor Day in New York on November 21. Thanks so much for listening. Operator : And thank you all who participated in today's conference, and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Thank you for standing by, and welcome to GE HealthCare's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Carolynne Borders with Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Carolynne Borders : Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to GE HealthCare's third quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined by our President and CEO, Peter Arduini; and Vice President and CFO, Jay Saccaro. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in today's press release and in the presentation slides available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about our performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. As described in our SEC filings, actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. With that, I'll hand the call over to Peter. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Carolynne, and thanks to all those joining us today. In the third quarter, we delivered 1% organic revenue growth, in line with our expectations, with strong performance in the U.S. across all segments, and solid growth in Pharmaceutical Diagnostics. In the quarter, we delivered positive price and volume. Organic orders growth was 1%. Excluding China, reported sales growth was approximately 5%, and orders growth was 4%, reflective of a healthy capital equipment market outside of China. On a total company level, we reported strong growth in backlog in the quarter that was primarily driven by services. As a reminder, multiyear service agreements support our reoccurring revenue profile with a high level of revenue predictability at accretive margins. In the U.S., strong orders in sales were driven by multiyear enterprise deals primarily made up of imaging products, particularly PET and CT systems, which are critical to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases. We are pleased with the progress that we're making to secure long-term partnerships which is foundational to our growth strategy. Another revenue driver in the quarter was PDx, team continues to deliver for customers, and we've seen PDx report seven quarters of high single-digit -- or double-digit organic revenue growth. Turning to China, we continue to monitor the market which has been slow to recover. Coordination of stimulus funding is taking longer, so customers are still delaying normal purchasing. This is impacting overall growth in the China market in the near-term. Bottom line is we continue to view this as a temporary challenge. And over the mid to long-term, we see China as an attractive market. Our margin performance in the quarter demonstrates our ongoing cost optimization priority, specifically the focus that we have on gross margin expansion, including product platforming and variable cost productivity. We continue to make progress with lean, taking action across the organization to make improvements for the benefit of our customers, and to drive better performance in overall safety, quality, delivery cost, and innovation. With overall continued execution, we were able to deliver strong adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted EPS. And we're raising the low-end of our full-year adjusted EBIT margin and adjusted EPS guidance ranges. Moving to innovation, we've talked about our leading role in Theranostics, a fast-growing field of molecular imaging the diagnosis and treatment of certain types of cancer. We've made some notable advancements in the space over the last few months. In Europe, we're establishing a Center of Excellence with University Medicine Essen, a top research institution in Germany. We're also leading an approximately $28 million initiative with multiple partners to expand its use. In the U.S., we secured FDA clearance for a new software tool to standardize and automate the process of measuring and calculating radiation dosage during Theranostics treatment. This tool will enable clinicians to safely increase patient access to this effective form of precision medicine. With that, I'll pass it to Jay, who will take us through the details of our third quarter performance and our outlook for 2024. Jay? Jay Saccaro : Thanks, Pete. Let's start with our financial performance on slide four. For the third quarter of 2024, we reported revenues of $4.9 billion, with organic revenue growth of 1%. This was in line with our expectations. Recall that we delivered 6% organic revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023. On a reported basis, we saw a service revenue growth of 2%, and product revenue was flat. As you can see from our reported sales detail in the quarterly filing this morning, market headwinds in China continue to impact total company sales growth in the quarter by approximately 400 basis points. Global sales growth excluding China was approximately 5%. Organic orders growth was 1% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in the United States and in emerging markets within Rest of World. Excluding China, organic orders growth was approximately 4%. We continue to see orders dollars outpacing sales leading to a strong company book-to-bill of 1.04x. We exited the third quarter with a healthy backlog of $19.6 billion, up $1.2 billion year-over-year, and up $600 million sequentially. We made strong margin progress in the quarter, delivering an adjusted EBIT margin of 16.3%, up 90 basis points year-over-year, and ahead of our expectations. As a result, third quarter EPS adjusted was $1.14, up 15% year-over-year. We also had tax benefits related to our 2023 tax filings completed in the third quarter of 2024. We generated free cash flow of $651 million, up $81 million year-over-year. Turning to progress we made in the third quarter on margin initiatives on slide five, adjusted gross margin expanded 150 basis points, driven by focused execution with variable cost productivity initiatives, continued sales price accretion, and higher margin NPIs. Of note, we've improved our cost productivity in the third quarter by partnering with global suppliers to drive deflation in direct material costs. We're also executing cost effective design changes with an enhanced focus on product quality, and improving the customer experience. We continue to see increased sales from digitally-enabled products like AIR Recon DL and Sonic DL in MR, driving higher margins. While expanding margin, we also invested more than $300 million in R&D, equating to roughly 6.5% of sales in the quarter. We remain committed to investments in innovation, focusing on differentiating technology and research collaboration. This includes exciting research in AI and cloud technologies that Pete will talk more about later. Nearly two years since the spin, we're pleased to have exited the majority of the TSAs and are on track to exit the remaining agreements on time. This positions us well to further optimize our cost structure. As discussed on prior calls, we see substantial opportunity over the next few years as it relates to IT and other structural cost optimization initiatives. One example of this is the implementation of software to eliminate duplicate and non-value added applications. By aligning licenses with specific roles and responsibilities, we'll deliver an annual savings of approximately $4 million. This is one of the many projects we have in our IT transformation roadmap. Given the volume pressures, we're maintaining a disciplined approach to our discretionary spending. Before we turn to our segments, as a reminder, we're now reporting results in our new segment structure, which went into effect on July 1. Image Guided Therapies previously part of Imaging was realigned to the former Ultrasound segment, which is now known as Advanced Visualization Solutions. This structure better aligns to future clinical trends and will better enable us to deliver strong business and customer impacts by providing the right image guidance in the right care setting. Now, let's move on to segment performance starting with Imaging on slide six. Organic revenue was down 1% versus the prior year due to headwinds in the China market as we expected. This was partially offset by strength in the United States. Segment EBIT margin was up 200 basis points year-over-year. We continued to make progress on enhancing gross margin through productivity. Additionally, we saw favorable mix and positive price. We continue to see strong demand, particularly in the U.S. with opportunities in replacements, upgrades and services. Turning to Advanced Visualization Solutions on slide seven, Organic revenue was flat year-over-year with increased sales volume in the U.S. offset by a decrease in China due to the previously discussed market headwinds. Segment EBIT margin decreased 90 basis points year-over-year, driven by unfavorable mix. Cost productivity improvements through standardization and new product introductions offset inflation. Moving to Patient Care Solutions on slide eight, organic revenue was up 2% year-over-year, driven by backlog execution and following 9% growth in the prior year. Segment EBIT margin increased 10 basis points year-over-year with improved productivity. The team has reduced past due backlog throughout the year, driven by lean principles to increase capacity. These actions will allow for greater fulfillment flexibility in future quarters. Moving to Pharmaceutical Diagnostics on slide nine, we delivered another solid quarter, generating 7% year-over-year organic growth, driven by healthy procedure volumes. And we delivered EBIT margin of approximately 31%. We're pleased with the continued growth contributions and margin expansion in this segment as well as the progress we've made in expanding our capacity and pipeline investments. We're encouraged by the recent CMS reimbursement proposal and the potential for patients to have access to important diagnostic scans in U.S. hospitals. This increases our confidence that our proprietary molecules like DaTscan, Vizamyl, Cerianna, and Flyrcado can be growth drivers for the company over time. If the proposed payment rule is finalized, we expect to see accelerated utilization of PET diagnostics and potentially an increase in the overall penetration rate for PET diagnostics versus other alternatives. Turning to slide 10, I'll walk through cash flow. We delivered strong free cash flow of $651 million, up $81 million year-over-year. We saw progress in driving working capital management efficiency. We're improving our accounts payable processes. And we saw strong collections in the U.S. and PDx business year-over-year. We had a great example of lean in action on inventory management and material processes at one of our key imaging sites. The team held a Kaizen and identified opportunities, and implemented changes to reduce the lead time from staging through shipping, leading to approximately $4 million of inventory savings. Again, this is just one of the many examples taking place in our facilities around the world. Looking ahead, in line with seasonality, we expect to deliver strong free cash flow in the fourth quarter, which is typically our highest revenue and cash generating quarter. Now, let's turn to our outlook on slide 11. We expect full-year 2024 organic revenue growth to trend toward the lower end of our 1% to 2% guidance due to the continued China market softness. Based on this trend, we expect to see limited market benefit from China's stimulus through the first-half of 2025. As a result of our strong margin performance year-to-date, we're raising the low-end of adjusted EBIT margin guidance to be in the range of 15.8% to 16%, reflecting expansion of 70 to 90 basis points versus 2023 adjusted EBIT margin of 15.1%. As it relates to our financial assumptions, we're trending towards the lower end of our adjusted tax rate range of 23% to 25%, given some additional tax incentives recognized in the third quarter of 2024. We also expect the revenue headwind from foreign exchange to be less than one half of a percent in 2024. And with increasing confidence in our ability to grow the bottom line, we're raising the low-end of the range of adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 now to $4.25 to $4.35 per share. This reflects year-over-year growth of 8% to 11%. We continue to expect free cash flow for the year to be approximately $1.8 billion. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Pete. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Jay. We're excited to talk to you about all of the growth opportunities ahead at our Investor Day in November. But today, I'll highlight two of these opportunities. We recently announced Flyrcado, also known as flurpiridaz. This is the first and only FDA-approved F-18 PET myocardial perfusion imaging tracer for patients with coronary artery disease. It's been called a game-changer by some cardiologists because of its improved diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional spec imaging. And its half-life is significantly longer than the most commonly used cardiac PET tracers. Flyrcado will become commercially available in the U.S. in early 2025, and we believe it will provide a meaningful impact for clinicians and their patients. I won't go deep into the details now, we'll do that at Investor Day, but to give you a sense of the opportunity, we estimate that there are around six million myocardial perfusion imaging procedures per year in the U.S., of which we believe PET NPI makes up about 5% to 10%. Revenue will ramp over time, and we're working with healthcare providers to build out the capacity required to enable greater access to PET for cardiology. We see an opportunity for revenues of greater than $500 million annually from this one proprietary molecule once the health system infrastructure is in place. We're excited about the opportunity for Flyrcado, and for other radio pharmaceuticals given the significant advancements we're seeing in this space, as well as the potential changes in reimbursement that will drive more personalized care. Additionally, we're investing in new AI and cloud-based solutions to better serve our customers who face data overload and widespread operational inefficiencies that drain their resources. We recently announced our latest advancements at HLTH, a premier technology event in Las Vegas, including CareIntellect, an offering of generative AI-powered clinical and operational applications. It streamlines patient data from multiple systems into a single view to help optimize care delivery and quality across disease states. We also shared several research projects that seek to address pressing care needs and reduce cognitive and administrative burdens on clinicians. We continue to invest in AI and cloud innovations that will drive future reoccurring revenue, which we'll talk more about next month. In summary, we delivered positive sales and orders growth in the quarter, reflecting strength in the U.S., and solid PDx revenue performance. With approximately 5% sales growth and 4% orders growth excluding China, we see a healthy capital equipment environment. We're confident in the fundamentals of our business, supported by our innovation and our pipeline, as well as our strong backlog. The team is focused on lean to improve the customer experience and enhanced productivity has allowed us to deliver strong bottom line results. As we enter the final quarter of the year, our expectations for 2024 on the top line reflect the China market dynamics, and with continued bottom line expansion, driven by our team's strong operational focus and execution. With that, we'll open up the call for questions. Carolynne Borders : Thank you, Peter. I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, can you please open the line? Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Robbie Marcus of J.P. Morgan. Your question, please, Robbie? Robbie Marcus : Great, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Two for me, one on margins, one on China, maybe to start with margins, another good quarter with upside on operating margin, dropped that through to EPS. I guess the question is really around the line of sight. How much of the low-hanging fruit has been picked already today, and what's your line of sight to future operating margin expansion as you move into the next phase of separation? Jay Saccaro : Sure. Robbie, overall, margins have trended well. As we commented and as you can see in our financials, EBIT margin is roughly up 70 basis points on a year-to-date basis, and gross margin is up about 130 basis points. So, we feel really good about the initiatives that we have and the operational focus on expanding margin. And I'll remind you, all of this is done against lower sales volumes than we expected at the beginning of the year. And frankly, as we look at what we've delivered on so far this year, now it's about that pricing that we've talked about historically, largely in line with what we previously expected. We've talked about variable cost productivity initiatives that have more than offset inflation. And then, we also have general savings initiatives we put in place that yielded a result. I would say that one thing that we did at the midpoint of the year when we saw a little bit more of a challenging revenue environment, we wanted to make sure we had the right cost profile for the business in place to support delivery of our earnings. So, we put some incremental savings initiatives in place. We're really pleased with that we've been able to do on this front. So, you can see the really good progress in the financial result, but I think as we look forward we also have very good line of sight to future margin improvements. And I would say we're really excited to share some of this at the upcoming Investor Day how we're thinking about the long-term margin profile. As we look forward, you'll see some of the continued themes; continued focus on price and continued focus on productivity initiatives. But what's going to supplement it as we move into the future is, first, this idea that as we come off the transition service agreement, which has been a very significant effort this year, and we expect to principally conclude it this year, it does allow us to pursue a number of new initiatives that we've been unable to, to date. The second thing that you'll start to see in the future is the benefit of all of these R&D investments that we've made. We are launching differentiated products, and we'll start to highlight that for you. And that has with it a real customer interest in those products or a revenue growth element, but also a margin element as well as we look at things like platforming. So, the complexion changes a little bit, but what I would say is we have a long way to go on margin. And we also have very good line of sight to what we're trying to achieve. Robbie Marcus : Great. Maybe one on China, which was down over 20% in the quarter, and we're seeing this across the board with your competitors. I guess the question is really how do you think about the forward trajectory of China? Like you said, ex-China business grew 5%, that's where people are sitting for the total company for next year. What's your visibility into the current trends in China, and any stabilization and improvement? And how do you think about China as we move into next year as, obviously, that'll be the biggest lever on sales growth, I imagine? Thanks a lot. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Robbie. Maybe I'll expand a little bit on this so we can address because I'm sure other people have questions on this, maybe in one question, between Jay and I, we'll go a little bit through this and then have time for other topics. But look, as we said, I think the China market has been slow to recovery. I mean we were pretty clear about this back in July as well. And as we mentioned on the call, stimulus funding coordination, I would say, is taking longer. So, customers are still delaying normal purchasing. And again, this is impacting the overall growth in China market in the near-term. I would say program details for many of the 31 provinces are now available. And we stay closely connected with the local markets as we have a large team on the ground there, I think we have a pretty good understanding of how things are evolving. And as I said in our prepared remarks, and we see it today, you see limited market improvement really going out through the first-half of 2025. And so, the question might be, well, how do you think about that? And I'll say, we think about it in four steps, particularly in capital equipment, which is, this first part is are funds released on funds set up. And so, yes there are clarity about certain tenders, but where the funds are and are they released hasn't been fully communicated. And then, you move into actually kicking off the tender process itself, where is it going to be multiple awardees, single, whatnot. Then you actually have the awarding of them, so hospitals find out which products they're going to get. And in many cases most of these products have an installation process, right, there's power, building setup, and things of that nature that have to take place. And then, they're installed, and the sale takes place. When we look at that sequence of things, that's when we basically say we see limited recovery relative to what one would see in sales in the first-half of 2025. That all being said, we believe this is a temporary challenge. And again, over the mid to long-term, we think China market is going to be, obviously, a very attractive market. All during this time, the need is not going away, the actual demand is still being pent up, all right, that nothing has changed from that standpoint. But we're just taking a pragmatic view until we really see change happening. Jay, maybe you can add a little bit more details here about how we thought about the guide and how we look at the -- how this is evolving? Jay Saccaro : Sure. So, when we gave guidance in July, you will all recall, we reduced guidance roughly $400 million to $600 million at the midpoint, $500 million related to China on the sales line, and that correlated to our total company guide of 1% to 2%. Our view today is within the range of outcomes we expected, but it's just at the lower end at approximately 1%. Year-to-date, our sales in China are down 17%, and we now expect China to be down high teens for the full-year. And so, what that means is it's closer to that $600 million impact. When stimulus starts to come through, it will be a positive development and we think we're well positioned to benefit, but timing that is something that we don't want to get involved in. As it relates to when the rebound takes place in China '25, like at this point, I would say we expect limited benefit from the stimulus through the first-half of '25. We'll watch this very carefully in the coming months leading up to giving guidance in February. So, I mean, in essence, we've taken fundamentally the effects of the China discussions out of how we are thinking about the guide. We're keeping a very close watch on the marketplace. And obviously, we're really well positioned when the stimulus finally comes through and the market comes back. At the same time, we've had tremendous growth in the United States. We've got great things happening in other markets within Southeast Asia. We see growth being able to be positioned well to continue to accelerate in the rest of, say, in Europe. And again, at Investor Day, what we're super excited about is to talk to you about the big three in our world, which is where radiopharmaceuticals is going, the new products that we have coming out in categories where we might not have had a leadership product that we will in the future, and then digital and AI. So, it's the combination of all of those pieces together, but I'd say China as we see it today, I think, we've kind of articulated our views on it. Robbie Marcus : Appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Peter Arduini : Thanks, Robbie. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Zimmerman of BTIG. Your line is open, Ryan. Ryan Zimmerman : Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone, nice to speak with you this morning. So, I appreciate the commentary on China and the margins. I actually want to ask about for Flyrcado a little bit. Pete, appreciate the comments you kind of put around it. I'm curious, there's been a lot of questions from investors around pricing of Flyrcado relative to maybe Rubidium 82, and when I do the math, it kind of lands somewhere in that 2x to 3x range relative to where Rubidium is coming in at. And so, I'm just curious if you can comment a little bit more about how you think about pricing that product given its features, its half-life, et cetera, as a premium to what's out there in the market today? Peter Arduini : Yes. Thanks, Ryan, for the question. We're not ready to talk specifically about the pricing. We will be in the not too distant future. But needless to say, to your point, we're a product that brings better specificity, sensitivity than predicate and spec, brings significantly better operational capabilities and economics versus the other PET agents that are there, in that case, ammonia or rubidium. We believe the product clearly deserves a premium. And we're also, as you can imagine right now, since we have approval, the normal process here of working with CMS and other payers to be able to be positioned that way. We'll be going through a pass through indication as well, which should give a multi-year higher window, see how all of that plays out. And then, there's the backdrop here of beyond the drug itself is the outpatient, the prospective outpatient payment structure, which will reimburse these agents separately. So, there's a lot of good tailwind components on it. But as I mentioned on the call, I mean, the most important words one hears when you're in this seat is when one of your customers says, I think this is a game-changer. And that's what's super exciting here about this for patients. But the fact that perfusion studies fundamentally haven't had many new innovations in forever. And so, this has the opportunity to really make a difference from that standpoint. And as we mentioned on the call, if you take a look at this, there's about 6 million myocardial perfusion studies that are out there today, that are done on spec. And you typically have to do a rest study and then you have the patient exercise or do stress and you compare the heart perfusion at rest and at stress. And so, that means there's two doses. There's a dose at stress and there's a dose at rest or vice versa. And so, each of those doses obviously have economic value that's associated with them. So, we feel quite good about it. We've got work to do yet to kind of get to the launch play. We've got the work to do here in the rest of the year. But we're on track to what our plans are, which would be really out into later part of Q1 to be in a position to be able to launch the product and have clarity on reimbursement. Ryan Zimmerman : Okay, very helpful. And then, for Jay, part of the algorithm for 4G has been in price. The market is growing 2%, 3%. You've kind of always articulated an assumption of 1% to 2% in price. I'm wondering if you could comment, Jay, about your assumptions going into '25 on price, the durability of that within your customer base and just how we should be thinking about your ability to get price going forward. Jay Saccaro : Sure. As I mentioned moments ago, we saw a positive sales price in the quarter along the lines of what we expected on a year-to-date basis, price is trending well. And I think really what this comes down to and what we're incredibly excited to talk about when we meet with you all is new products being a key catalyst for this. We've invested very significantly in R&D over the last several years. And so, as you support your customers with new and innovative devices and new and innovative solutions, price follows. And that's something that we've seen, we've been able to deliver on. So, we feel very good about pricing and overall margin related to new products going forward. Peter Arduini : And I would say, Ryan, what we're getting better as an organization to do and I'll make a call out to Catrine and our U.S. organization about really being able to help the customer understand return on investment. Many of our products and many of our institutions are completely maxed out with procedures. And so, you buy a new product and yes, you may pay 100 grant more from us than maybe someone else, but you can literally have it paid for in under 18 months. And you're going to have this then for another six to seven years. And the question then is, does it really maximize the value for your patients? Does it really actually have the uptime? Does it have the added features to deal with if it's in cardiology, structured heart or oncology? And so we're getting better at that and ultimately being able to sell value to go that direction, which is why gross margin for us on actually the cost input, but on the value side is an extremely important metric for us. Ryan Zimmerman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of Citi. Your question, please, Joanne. Joanne Wuensch : Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I'll put them both out front. You gave us the number that you think that Flyrcado could contribute $500 million once the infrastructure is in place at the hospitals. So, I'm curious, what does it take for the infrastructure to be in place? Is this structural? Is it human resources, something else? And then, for my second question, can you give us an update on how, Vizamyl is doing? Thank you. Peter Arduini : Yes. Maybe I'll take the first part and then Jay maybe you can touch on Vizamyl. Look, so first part is, Flyrcado is an agent used in PET scanners. I think most of the folks on the call understand that a lot of PET has been around oncology applications. So, if you look in your normal hospital or clinic, the majority of where you're going to find PET has traditionally been in oncology. And there's a lot that's growing on there. I mentioned Theranostics on the call, if you think about PSMA, think about breast cancer. So, those systems are getting up. I think in the initial areas, there are certain cardiac centers that have had PET systems prior to this where they've been using other agents. Those will be the first areas that have the infrastructure in place. But the point being is, is that some customers are going to need to acquire a PET system and have it in their cardiology area to effectively run. We would expect in certain institutions there'll be shared use systems, but obviously for a company like us that actually makes the radio isotopes and actually makes the imaging systems, makes the digital tools to integrate all this together. There's actually a really interesting opportunity to not only have the agent sale, but also have capital equipment sales that will be part of this. The ramp, I think we're still trying to understand how fast it could be. We quoted when it's in place over a $0.5 billion. Obviously, if you converted all of the business, it's a significantly larger number, but we're not ready to call that at this point in time. But we feel pretty good about it. And again, it gets back to ultimately the difference it can make for a patient and the economics it can mean for our customers to deliver that. This has great economics and it has great outcome for patients. Typically when those two things happen, you have a winner on your hands, and that's how we feel about Flyrcado. And then, as it relates to Vizamyl, we continue to see encouraging progress with Vizamyl sales in the U.S. Our sales in the U.S. nearly doubled in the quarter-over-quarter, so very, very robust growth rates. Our approach in Alzheimer's really is about supporting the continuum of care across diagnostic, therapy planning, delivery, and monitoring. And also, this area will benefit from the CMS ruling, which we expect to pass. That should also help accelerate this. It's still early stages in this area, and the patient and the therapy journeys are still in the very early stages, but we remain really excited about this opportunity long-term. And this is another one that we'll highlight at the upcoming Investor Day. Jay Saccaro : And I think, Joanne, you know, this that Jay mentioned in his prepared remarks, with the reimbursement changes that are coming, you can take these innovative products, some that we've already had in our portfolio and some of these that are new, and now they can be reimbursed or paid for at the value they should be. So, something that might have only been getting $200 for a customer could get a tenfold increase in reimbursement aligned to that, which then changes a customer's thoughts about how many procedures you can use this for. In many cases, a product for like Parkinson's for DaTscan that we've had for some time, which has been successful, can be used more widely because the economics make sense. Or a product like Cerianna for breast cancer, which is clearly a product that's indicated that delivers better diagnostics, but has been tough because of the economics, that could change as well. So, again, all of these we think are positive and all of these products have higher gross margins than the rest of our portfolio. So, the mixed benefit that will come through with these as well is quite positive. Thank you. Joanne Wuensch : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Roman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, David. David Roman : Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Before I ask the question, I just wanted to thank you for all the very helpful disclosures on the recast of the business segmentation with all the supporting detail. It is very helpful and appreciated. Maybe just jumping in as a follow-up to what, Pete, what you just walked through here on GE's capacity to operate across the entire spectrum within pharmaceutical diagnostics, maybe you could help us just by deconstructing that business a little bit into its components around capital or capital-related items, including software and service, how much of that is on the radio tracer side or radio pharma side, and how we should think about the different growth levers in each of those pieces. And I had a follow-up on the P&L. Peter Arduini : Yes, it's a really good question, David, because unlike most pharmaceutical businesses where, it might be an injectable or an oral sale, these are a little more complicated. And I say complicated in some ways that they have to come together in concert with other items, but also in such a way that, from generics or other folks coming into it, you have to actually have the infrastructure. So, in the case of these, to remind everyone, they are radioactive agents. How you actually make them? How you deliver them, as a very select set of expertise to be able to do that, which we have. And so, again, I think at the highest level, this first part is a proprietary molecule portfolio which we have, it touches in oncology, that's going to be a beneficial tie to what's happening in this field of Theranostics, again, the ability to actually see what you treat and treat what you see. In the neurospace, we talk about Vizamyl and Alzheimer's. That's a radiopharmaceutical neurospace, we talk about Vizamyl and Alzheimer's. That's a radiopharmaceutical tracer, again, to help highlight amyloid beta plaque, or in the case of DaTscan, the ability to actually help understand and diagnose Parkinson's. And then, in the cardiology side is for CERDAS. So, we actually have the trifecta of different areas here for products. Then you take a look at it and you say the reimbursement environment hasn't been the greatest in the U.S. That has the potential here to evolve. Hopefully, we're going to hear more about the rulings in the near term. We feel pretty good about that. But that will enable those to be paid at effective level. The other side, then, is the equipment that these are used into to be able to image. And so, we make PET, PET/CT, PET/MR. We haven't spoken that much about it most recently, but our StarGuide SPECT camera is really a one of very special product that actually can be used to actually stage some of the therapy drugs in combination. That's a critical component to enabling a Theranostics study and what I mean by that is if you don't have a camera like ours, that patient study could take an hour and a half versus 10 minutes and then all of a sudden you don't have a workflow solution. We have that whole package. And the last part is the digital integration. And so, we bought this company just a little while ago called MIM. Fantastic group of individuals, great technology in the top strategic and most advanced institutions around the world, and we're adding artificial intelligence into it and capabilities. And so, what does that product do? It helps you be kind of at the command center, if you will, of how the dose is to that patient, how the product's working. So, you have to have all those together. And the short answer is, we do. And so, for a customer that's looking into buying parts of this, if they can work with someone like GE HealthCare, who has the commercial and technical team that can bring you the whole solution, most likely customers are more willing to come to you and look to your expertise to help implement that. And that's ultimately what we try to do is to help customers solve their solutions and help them implement it broadly. David Roman : That's really helpful. And then, Jay, on the P&L, I know you'll provide 2025 guidance at a later date, but as we kind of think about the building blocks to next year. We appreciate the comments around China's stimulus, but as you look down the income statement, you've had this giant step up in R&D that looks at maybe that starts to normalize to more sustainable growth rates. SG&A has been well managed, but are there any one-time things that may have occurred this year, like rebasing of incentive comp, because you're going to come in below the top line that we need to consider in next year and anything that you want to call out for us at this point in time as we think about updating our models into next year? Jay Saccaro : Sure. And David, by the way, thanks for your comment on the recast financials. I know that there are a lot of finance and accounting folks and legal folks from GE HealthCare listening and who put a lot of work into that. So, we appreciate that. As you think about next year P&Ls stopping short of any guidance, one key variable is this China factor. To your point, and I've said this in the past, R&D has been growing at a significantly higher rate than sales. At some point, it will grow in line with sales, and we will get closer to that next year. And then, from an SG&A standpoint, you're right, incentive payouts when sales are off are lower, but it's more of a variable compensation thing, it kind of moves with sales. So, as sales moves up, that category moves up. I don't expect to see a very dramatic one-time step-up next year as a result of reduction this year. So, I think the items that you characterized are the right ones, and we'll construct the rest of it leading up to guidance in February. David Roman : Great. Appreciate you taking the questions. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. Your question, please, Larry. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Jay Saccaro : Good morning. Larry Biegelsen : Good morning. I just wanted to follow up maybe a little bit on David's comments. What's the message on 2025, given your China comments of limited recovery for the -- through the first-half, or limited benefit, I think, from the stimulus in the first-half of 2025? I'm asking because the comps get easier for China in the first quarter of 2025. It's declining the first quarter of this year. So, is the message on China that it declines or grows in 2025 and how does that impact the mid-single-digit top line growth and margin progression next year? And I had one follow-up. Jay Saccaro : Yes, Larry. I think, we will start short of giving guidance for next year because I think what we've seen is there's a lot of volatility in that market in particular, and so we're going to wait for a lot to gather a lot more information before we give guidance in February. As it relates to midterm guidance, we feel very good about midterm compounded, mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. And in a capital business, some years are above, as we saw in '22, '23, some years below, as we saw in '24. But on balance, we've been able to execute on this mid-single-digit growth, and we look forward to talking to you more about that at our Investor Day. From a margin standpoint, we feel very good about what we've been able to do in 2024, delivering at the high end of the range despite a low-end revenue guide. And the pipeline for margin looks really good in 2025 and beyond. And so, that's kind of what we're prepared to say in terms of the outlook for the company. And as it relates to 2025, it's more wait and see to see how this market does. We think, long-term, China represents a really good and attractive market for GE HealthCare. We've been there a long time. We've been manufacturing there over 30 years. So, it's a robust environment. But anticipating the timing of this recovery has proved to be a really challenging forecasting exercise. So, based on all of that, we're going to be conservative when we give guidance as we typically are, and we're going to be thoughtful and incorporate all the information. We'll get a lot more information in the coming months. And then, the last thing I would say is, you know, looking at things over time, we feel very good about the margin expansion plan. So, that's something that, you know, I think we've been intensely focused on, and we've been able to deliver on margin despite a wide range of outcomes on revenue, as we've seen. Pete, what would you add to that? Peter Arduini : I think you hit it. And Larry, as you know, we've got our Investor Day in less than a month here in November on the 21st. And I think we're going to try to lay our case out here on what we've got for top line growth over the next three years, which fundamentally, as you guys all know, in this industry, it takes some time to be able to execute on some of the programs. And we feel super good. And one of the goals is to show you what we've done with the R&D money, which is the NPI pipeline in areas that you would expect and in areas that I hope you'll be impressed with. It's going to open up new growth areas for us within our portfolio, how we're evolving the digital and AI front, and again, not only just in inside the products but products by themselves that are digital in nature. And then, this whole radiopharmaceutical piece, and to me, it's those three levers that are going to help us really around the world, but particularly in some of the Western developed markets where precision medicine is becoming an adopted at a faster rate. Larry Biegelsen : That's very helpful. Just to speak in a quick follow-up, Jay, can you confirm the implied Q4 organic growth is slightly above 2% based on the new guidance. What gets better in Q4 versus Q3 and the confidence in the sequential ramp in dollars from Q3 to Q4? Thank you. Jay Saccaro : Yes. So, the third quarter came in as we expected, roughly 1%. In the fourth quarter, we do reflect the China dynamic. Fourth quarter is typically our strongest quarter of the year from a volume standpoint. I think last year, we had a $400 million step-up from 3Q to 4Q. We're expecting, I think, roughly similar levels as we look at the numbers this year, maybe a little bit more. And how are we going to get there? It's about continued strength in our PDx and service business. Those things will step up in the fourth quarter. We've made a lot of positive comments about the U.S. market. We expect that to continue. And then, the last thing I would say is we do have an analytic that we put in place each of our quarters, looking at conversion of backlog, looking at what's repeatable, recurring revenue, backlog, and then how much do we need to sell and install in the quarter. And so, just to walk through that very briefly, about half of our revenue is related to recurring items, notably service and PDx. And we have a very good line of sight in that area. The remaining half is equipment-related. And equipment-related comes down to two pieces. How much are you counting on from the backlog and how much are you counting to sell and install in the quarter? From the backlog, we're over 75% secured as we say at this point which is very complex to historic rates. And we feel good about that component. And then, the other piece is how much do you sell and install in the quarter. And as we look at the funnel and anticipated conversion to orders and to sales, we'll expect to see conversion rates similar to what we've had in the past. And so, nothing dramatic in terms of trajectory differences, and all of that yields that roughly 2% revenue growth in the fourth quarter. So, there's a lot of different ways to look at it. But that's one detailed way that we go through it when we feel good about the fourth quarter. Larry Biegelsen : All right, thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore. Please go ahead, Vijay. Vijay Kumar : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Pete, I have two product-related questions. The first one on Flyrcado, just given all the comments you made, right, is there any reason to think why half of all NPI procedures in the medium term can't flip over to this flurpiridaz? It's better for patients, better for hospitals, better for supply chain. I'm just trying to think what the hurdles are. Peter Arduini : Yes, Vijay, it's -- I agree with you. All of the right components are in place. The biggest piece is, is are there enough PET systems in the right locations, is probably the biggest driver. So, you could clearly see a step-up in the locations where they have the product -- again, the product -- where they have the PET system in place. But then, it takes some time. Let's just assume a customer says, \"Gee, I really want to go all in on this.\" And they give us orders here in the next month to buy the systems. You're still with a PET room being prepared and installed and stuff in an area. You're six to nine to 12 months out. And so, that's probably the biggest piece. But again, over a horizon of three to five years, I think to your point, there are clear scenarios where you could have a much, much higher percentage of conversion. But we're just trying to be pragmatic at this point in time on how we frame this up. Vijay Kumar : That's helpful, Pete. And maybe one related one here is when you think about the system side, right, could Flyrcado be a driver for PET systems for you guys? I know -- when you look at systems outside of PET, I think you've launched this AI product on the MRI side. Are we seeing any share gains on the system side that could GE HealthCare fundamentally emerge in a much stronger position on the system side? Peter Arduini : I think the answer is yes. You could clearly see this as a driver. And again, I think it's for us. I think it's for the whole category that this will actually have an effect. And the question is, well, why? If you think about PET imaging forever it's been FDG. So, fundamentally, a generic phase tracer that can be used primarily for broad oncology procedures. Now, you're getting more personalized, specific molecules that are tied to a given disease state. And so, all of a sudden, the use of PET -- again, as I had mentioned earlier, in neuro procedures for Alzheimer's and cardio for, like, Flyrcado for coronary perfusion, or in oncology as it's been used, but more specific, and we'll talk about that at Investor Day about how that pipeline of molecules is coming, and not only in diagnostics but also in therapeutics, which will drive that. So, we're quite excited about it. And I would just say for our team, which is in molecular imaging in Roland's business and the teams, they've done a really nice job. We have a platform that actually is very scalable. It's upgradable in the field. And we also think we have a distinctive capability that enable us to do some early types of evaluation in this space that other products in the market can't do. So, we'll talk more about that on November 21, but yes, we're quite excited about this combination of new agents, reimbursement for the agents, and then the equipment that's integrated around it, both digital and the hardware. And I think that's going to be a growth driver for many years to come. Vijay Kumar : Fantastic. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sezgi Ozener of HSBC. Your question, please, Sezgi. Sezgi Ozener : Hi, thanks for taking my question. One, on the revenue classification, please, thanks for the information. Peter Arduini : Sezgi, I'm really sorry, we can't hear you at all. Sezgi Ozener : Is it better now? Peter Arduini : Let's go with -- Carolynne Borders : Let's go to the next question since we can't hear Sezgi. And this will actually be our last question, given the time constraints. Sezgi Ozener : Okay, it should be -- Peter Arduini : Is that Sezgi? Operator : I'm sorry. Actually, we're on our next question which comes from the line of Navann Ty of BNP Paribas. Your line is open, Navann. Navann Ty : Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Following up on China, so, we understand there is low visibility. So, which of the four steps you described are we in now in Q1 -- sorry, in Q4? And what visibility do you have into the first-half in terms of tender activity moving into the execution phase? And then, on Flyrcado, can you detail what you have to do ahead of the launch in late Q1? And which U.S. markets will you target initially? Thank you. Peter Arduini : Yes, I think we've kind of covered the China part. And of the four parts, we're kind of in the first step here, which again is we see a lot of activity coming together. The funds haven't been released, so the tenders haven't been opened. But it's kind of the step one. And relative to Flyrcado, I think as far as the work that has to be done, we have the FDA approval. We're working here in the United States with CMS and what's called the MACs for the reimbursement process. And, we'll be working with selective countries around the world to do the same thing. So, that's the combination of the work as well as our normal ramp ups for commercialization, training of our teams, positioning all those things. But much of that's in position. And, we would suspect that we'll be commercializing in late Q1 if everything plays out how we think. Thank you for your question. Peter Arduini : So, I think with that, we're going to wrap up, I think. And so, again, thank you all for joining us today. Appreciate all of your interest. And, we look forward to hopefully connecting with all of you in the coming days at our Investor Day, which is just around the corner here at NASDAQ marketplace in New York on November 21st. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
